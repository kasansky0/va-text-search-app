REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1969 to January 1973. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions issued in May 2024 and June 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. The Veteran testified at a Board hearing on November 5, 2024, a transcript of which is associated with the record. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal as it relates to entitlement to earlier effective dates for the awards of service connection for left and right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerves, and at the time of the June 2024 AOJ decision on appeal as it relates to all other issues on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decisions on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

As an initial matter, the Board is cognizant that the Veteran has received non-VA medical treatment, including primary care services. During the pendency of the claim, the Veteran submitted information for his non-VA primary care providers and a medical authorization for their records. The record reflects that the AOJ attempted to obtain the non-VA primary care records using the information and medical authorization provided by the Veteran. However, the AOJ received no response to its requests. In March 2023, the AOJ notified the Veteran and his representative that it had not received a response to its request for records from his non-VA primary care providers. The letter also informed him that it was his responsibility to make sure VA receives the evidence and encouraged him to submit additional information or evidence as soon as he could. 

The record is devoid of any receipt of the non-VA primary care records, either from the provider or from the Veteran or his representative during an appropriate evidentiary window or otherwise. Further, neither the Veteran nor his representative have asserted a duty to assist error with respect to the non-VA primary care records or any other non-VA records in the instant appeal. The Board finds the AOJ's efforts to obtain these non-VA records to be satisfactory and that there has been no pre-decisional duty to assist error as it pertains to these non-VA records in relation to the claims herein. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings that is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history, and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Examination reports are to be interpreted in the light of the whole recorded history, and each disability must be considered from the point of view of the Veteran working or seeking work. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2. The basis of a disability evaluation is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10. 

Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3. The benefit-of-the-doubt rule applies when the evidence is in approximate balance or nearly equal. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021). 

Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found - a practice known as "staged" ratings. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). Staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Id.

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the rating of 100 percent for coronary artery disease. 

The Veteran contends entitlement to an earlier effective date for the rating of 100 percent for coronary artery disease (CAD). 

The period on appeal starts on November 30, 2012, the date service connection for CAD was awarded, as the record reflects the Veteran has continuously pursued the issue of the initial rating for such since the AOJ decision awarding service connection was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). The Veteran's CAD is rated as 10 percent disabling from November 30, 2012, and as 100 percent disabling from February 7, 2024, under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7005 arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease). 38 C.F.R. § 4.104. 

In this regard, the Board notes that during the pendency of the appeal, VA revised the criteria for evaluating cardiovascular disorders, effective November 14, 2021. 86 Fed. Reg. 54,093 (Sept. 2021). When a new regulation is issued while a claim is pending before VA, unless clearly specified otherwise, VA must apply the new provision to the claim from the effective date of the change as long as the application would not produce retroactive effects. VAOPGCPREC 7-03; 69 Fed. Reg. 25,179 (2003). If application of an amended regulation has a retroactive effect, then the regulation cannot be applied. Rodriguez v. Peake, 511 F.3d 1147, 1153 (Fed. Cir. 2008). But even if the amended version is more favorable, the amended version may only be applied as of the effective date and, before that time, only the former version of the regulation may be applied. VAOPGCPREC 3-00; 65 Fed. Reg. 33,422 (2000); see also Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327, 1328-29 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

While the old and new criteria are similar, they are not identical. Prior to November 14, 2021, under the old criteria, a 10 percent rating is warranted with documented CAD requiring continuous medication or when a workload of greater than 7 metabolic equivalents (METs) but not greater than 10 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope. 

A 30 percent rating is warranted with documented CAD with evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilation on electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or X-ray, or when a workload of greater than 5 METs but not greater than 7 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope. 

A 60 percent rating is warranted with documented CAD with left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 30 to 50 percent, more than one episode of acute congestive heart failure in past year, or when a workload of greater than 3 METs but not greater than 5 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope. 

A 100 percent rating is warranted with documented CAD with chronic congestive heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of less than 30 percent, or when a workload of 3 METs or less results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7005 (2020). 

Under the old criteria, even if the requirement for a 10 percent (based on the need for continuous medication) or 30 percent (based on the presence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation) evaluation is met, METs testing is required in all cases except: 

(1) When there is a medical contraindication. 

(2) When the left ventricular ejection fraction has been measured and is 50 percent or less. 

(3) When chronic congestive heart failure is present or there has been more than one episode of congestive heart failure within the past year. 

(4) When a 100 percent evaluation can be assigned on another basis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.100(b). 

Under the old criteria, if left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) testing is not of record, the criteria directed evaluation based on the alternative criteria unless the examiner stated that the LVEF test is needed in a particular case because the available medical information does not sufficiently reflect the severity of the Veteran's cardiovascular disability. Id. at (c). 

As of November 14, 2021, DC 7005 is to be evaluated using the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart (General Rating Formula). 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7005. Under the General Rating Formula, a 10 percent rating is warranted for continuous medication required for control or when a workload of 7.1 to 10.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms. 

A 30 percent rating is warranted when a workload of 5.1 to 7.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms or with evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation confirmed by echocardiogram or equivalent (e.g., multigated acquisition scan or magnetic resonance imaging). 

A 60 percent rating is warranted when a workload of 3.1 to 5.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms. 

A100 percent rating is warranted when a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in heart failure symptoms. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, General Rating Formula.

Under the General Rating Formula, heart failure symptoms include, but are not limited to, breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, arrhythmia, palpitations, or syncope. Id. at Note 3. 

As of November 14, 2021, even if the requirement for a 10 percent (based on the need for continuous medication) or 30 percent (based on the presence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation) evaluation is met, METs testing is required in all cases except: 

(1) When there is a medical contraindication. 

(2) When a 100 percent evaluation can be assigned on another basis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.100(b). 

Under both the old and new criteria, whether or not cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation (documented by electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or X-ray) is present and whether or not there is a need for continuous medication must be ascertained in all cases. 38 C.F.R. § 4.100(a). 

Under both the new and old criteria, if nonservice-connected arteriosclerotic heart disease is superimposed on service-connected valvular or other non-arteriosclerotic heart disease, a medical opinion as to which condition is causing the current signs and symptoms shall be requested. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7005.

Under both the old and new criteria, one MET (metabolic equivalent) is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute. When the level of METs at which dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, an estimation by a medical examiner of the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope may be used. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note 2. 

In sum, to warrant a rating in excess of 10 percent prior to November 14, 2021, there must be evidence of:

1)	chronic congestive heart failure; 

2)	more than one episode of acute congestive heart failure in the past year;

3)	evidence of cardiac hypertrophy or dilation on electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or X-ray;

4)	left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 50 percent or less; or

5)	a workload of at least 7 METs resulting in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope. Id. at 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7005 (2020). 

To warrant a rating in excess of 10 percent after November 14, 2021, there must be evidence of:

1)	cardiac hypertrophy or dilation confirmed by echocardiogram or equivalent; or

2)	a workload of at least 7.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms (breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, arrhythmia, palpitations, or syncope). 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, General Rating Formula. 

The Veteran's CAD was diagnosed after a whole body diagnostic scan was performed in June 2011 showing atherosclerotic calcification throughout the aorta and branch vessels. At a visit to his VA primary care provider in August 2011, the day after an emergency visit for an asthma attack, the Veteran denied experiencing chest pain or shortness of breath. In August 2012 the Veteran denied chest tightness or difficulty breathing. In December 2012 he denied any new or worsening chest pain or shortness of breath. He continued to deny experiencing any chest pain and shortness of breath in June 2013, February 2014, August 2014, February 2015, August 2015, January 2016, February 2016, August 2016, November 2016, February 2017, April 2017, August 2017, October 2017, January 2018, August 2018, March 2019, August 2019, August 2020, November 2020, and February 2021. The Veteran also denied experiencing palpitations in November 2016, August 2017, August 2020, November 2020, and February 2021. The record is devoid of evidence showing the Veteran experiencing any dizziness, fatigue, or syncope in relation to his CAD prior to August 3, 2021. 

In March 2019 the Veteran's primary care provider described his CAD as asymptomatic. The Veteran was prescribed several assistive devices in February 2020 following a fall in the shower, but these records show the Veteran's fall and need for assistive devices was due to low back pain and weakness. The record also reflects the Veteran has several significant respiratory and pulmonary disorders. In August 2020 the Veteran's VA dermatologist noted he was chronically short of breath but that this was his baseline and was not worse recently. The provider also noted that he had experienced leg swelling in June of 2020 which exacerbated his stasis dermatitis and that this was due to what was probably a congestive heart failure exacerbation or other cause of fluid overload. No other medical records suggest the Veteran had a congestive heart failure exacerbation in June 2020. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination on August 3, 2021. While the VA examiner was unable to determine if the Veteran's interview based METs testing result was solely due to his cardiac condition without considering the effect of his respiratory and pulmonary disorders, the examiner found that 1-3 METs caused dyspnea and dizziness. 

Upon review, and resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that from August 3, 2021, his coronary artery disease manifest with a workload of 3.0 metabolic equivalents or less resulting in dyspnea and dizziness. The evidence is approximately equal as to whether the Veteran's respiratory and pulmonary disorders cause him dyspnea and dizziness with 3 METs or less or whether his CAD alone causes him dyspnea and dizziness with 3 METs or less. Applying the benefit-of-the-doubt rule, the Board finds the Veteran's dyspnea and dizziness with 3 METs or less is caused by his CAD for purposes of this rating evaluation. Consequently, a 100 percent rating for CAD under DC 7005 is warranted from August 3, 2021. 

A rating in excess of 10 percent before August 3, 2021, for CAD under DC 7005 is not warranted, because the evidence during the period on appeal does not show the Veteran experienced dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope with at least 7 METs due to his CAD. The record is devoid of evidence showing hypertrophy or dilation on electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or X-ray, more than one episode of acute congestive heart failure in the past year, left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of at least 50 percent, or chronic congestive heart failure before August 3, 2021. 

In making its determinations in this case, the Board has carefully considered the Veteran's contentions with respect to the nature of his service-connected disability at issue and notes that his lay testimony is competent to describe certain symptoms associated with his CAD. The Veteran's history and reported symptoms have been considered, including as presented in the medical evidence discussed above, and have been contemplated by the disability rating that has been assigned. Moreover, the competent medical evidence offering detailed specific findings pertinent to the rating criteria is the most probative evidence when evaluating the pertinent symptoms of the service-connected disability at issue. As such, while the Board accepts the Veteran's testimony concerning matters that he is competent to address, the Board relies upon the competent medical evidence with regard to the specialized evaluations of functional impairment, symptom severity, and details of clinical features of the service-connected disability at issue. 

The Board has also considered whether additional staged ratings under Fenderson, supra, are appropriate for the Veteran's service-connected CAD; however, the Board finds that his symptomatology had been stable throughout the period on appeal before August 3, 2021, with a worsening as of August 3, 2021, which is reflected in the initial staged rating assigned herein. Therefore, additional staged ratings are not warranted. Further, neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with regard to the rating claim adjudicated herein. Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017).

In reaching the foregoing determinations, the Board has applied the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine and resolved all doubt in the Veteran's favor, which has resulted in the partial award assigned herein. However, insofar as the Board has denied an earlier effective date for the 100 percent rating for CAD, or a higher rating before August 3, 2021, the competent, probative evidence persuasively weighs against such aspects of the Veteran's claim. Therefore, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable, and his initial rating claim must otherwise be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the 60 percent rating for diabetic nephropathy. 

The Veteran contends entitlement to an earlier effective date for the 60 percent rating for diabetic nephropathy (nephropathy).

The period on appeal starts on August 31, 2022, the date service connection for nephropathy was awarded. The Veteran's nephropathy is rated as noncompensable or zero percent disabling prior to February 7, 2024, under DC 7541, renal involvement in diabetes mellitus type I or II, which directs rating as renal dysfunction under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b. It is rated as 60 percent disabling as of February 7, 2024, under the same criteria. 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a, renal dysfunction, a 60 percent rating is warranted with chronic kidney disease with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 30 to 44 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least three consecutive months during the past 12 months. 

A 30 percent rating is warranted with GFR from 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least three consecutive months during the past 12 months. 

A zero percent or noncompensable rating is warranted for lesser manifestations of renal dysfunction. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a, renal dysfunction. 

GFR, estimated GFR (eGFR), and creatinine-based approximations of GFR will be accepted for evaluation purposes under this section when determined to be appropriate and calculated by a medical professional. Id. 

The medical evidence of record reflects the Veteran's eGFR pertinent to the period on appeal as follows: 

August 2021 - eGFR 27 mL/min/1.73 m2; 

December 2021 - eGFR 27 mL/min/1.73 m2; 

April 2022 - eGFR 36 mL/min/1.73 m2; 

August 2022 - eGFR 35 mL/min/1.73 m2; and

September 2022 - GFR 38 mL/min/1.73 m2. 

Upon review, the Board finds that for the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's diabetic nephropathy manifest with chronic kidney disease with GFR from 30 to 44 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least three consecutive months during the past 12 months. While the Veteran's GFR results from August 2021 and December 2021 could support a more severe finding, the Board finds that the Veteran's GFR results in April 2022, August 2022, and September 2022 are more probative as to the Veteran's renal dysfunction during the period on appeal given their closer temporal relationship to the August 31, 2022 beginning of the appeal period. 

Further, the Veteran's representative specifically requested a 60 percent rating be assigned for nephropathy as of August 31, 2022, without a request for a higher rating in a February 2025 brief. Consequently, a 60 percent rating, but no higher, for nephropathy is warranted for the entire period on appeal. 

In making its determinations in this case, the Board has carefully considered the Veteran's contentions with respect to the nature of his service-connected disability at issue and notes that his lay testimony is competent to describe certain symptoms associated with his nephropathy. The Veteran's history and reported symptoms have been considered, including as presented in the medical evidence discussed above, and have been contemplated by the disability rating that has been assigned. Moreover, the competent medical evidence offering detailed specific findings pertinent to the rating criteria is the most probative evidence when evaluating the pertinent symptoms of the service-connected disability at issue. As such, while the Board accepts the Veteran's testimony concerning matters that he is competent to address, the Board relies upon the competent medical evidence with regard to the specialized evaluations of functional impairment, symptom severity, and details of clinical features of the service-connected disability at issue. 

The Board has also considered whether staged ratings under Fenderson, supra, are appropriate for the Veteran's service-connected nephropathy; however, the Board finds that his symptomatology has been stable throughout the period on appeal. Further, neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with regard to the rating claim adjudicated herein. Doucette, supra.

In reaching the foregoing determinations, the Board has applied the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine and resolved all doubt in the Veteran's favor, which has resulted in the partial award assigned herein. However, insofar as the Board has denied a higher rating, the competent, probative evidence persuasively weighs against such aspects of the Veteran's claim. Therefore, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable, and his initial rating claim must otherwise be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus type II.

The Veteran contends entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus type II (diabetes). 

The period on appeal starts on August 31, 2022, the date the VA received the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for diabetes plus a one-year look back period. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's diabetes is rated as 20 percent disabling under DC 7913, diabetes mellitus. 38 C.F.R. § 4.119. DC 7913 provides a structured scheme of specific, successive, cumulative criteria. Each higher rating includes the same criteria as the lower rating plus distinct new criteria. Middleton v. Shinseki, 727 F.3d 1172, 1178 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

A 10 percent rating is warranted when diabetes is manageable by restricted diet only.

A 20 percent rating is warranted when diabetes requires one or more daily injection of insulin and restricted diet, or an oral hypoglycemic agent and restricted diet. 

A 40 percent rating is warranted when it requires one or more daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities. 

A 60 percent rating is warranted when diabetes requires one or more daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring one or two hospitalizations per year or twice a month visits to a diabetic care provider, plus complications that would not be compensable if separately evaluated. 

A 100 percent rating is warranted when diabetes requires more than one daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities, with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring at least three hospitalizations per year or weekly visits to a diabetic care provider, plus either progressive loss of weight and strength or complications that would be compensable if separately evaluated. Id. at DC 7913. 

Compensable complications of diabetes are evaluated separately unless they are part of the criteria used to support a 100 percent evaluation. Noncompensable complications of diabetes are considered part of the diabetic process. Id. at Note 1. The record has not reasonably raised nor has the Veteran or his representative expressly raised entitlement to any additional compensable complications of diabetes that are not already separately rated.

Because DC 7913 contains successive criteria, the criteria for the lower rating must be met before a higher disability rating may be awarded. A higher rating cannot be granted based on a finding that the Veteran's disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the next higher rating. However, reasonable doubt regarding the presence of a criterion may be resolved in the Veteran's favor. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245 (2018).

The question in this appeal is whether the Veteran's diabetes mellitus required one or more daily injections of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities. Regulation of activities is defined as avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities. This criterion requires medical evidence. Camacho v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 360, 364-65 (2007).

Upon review, for the entire period on appeal, the Board finds the Veteran's diabetes mellitus type II did not require the use of insulin. The medical evidence of record does not show that the Veteran had been prescribed insulin during the period on appeal. Rather, they show the Veteran has only been prescribed an oral hypoglycemic for diabetes during the entire period on appeal. Consequently, a rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes is not warranted. 

In making its determinations in this case, the Board has carefully considered the Veteran's contentions with respect to the nature of his service-connected disability at issue and notes that his lay testimony is competent to describe certain symptoms associated with his diabetes. The Veteran's history and reported symptoms have been considered, including as presented in the medical evidence discussed above, and have been contemplated by the disability rating that has been assigned. Moreover, the competent medical evidence offering detailed specific findings pertinent to the rating criteria is the most probative evidence when evaluating the pertinent symptoms of the service-connected disability at issue. As such, while the Board accepts the Veteran's testimony concerning matters that he is competent to address, the Board relies upon the competent medical evidence with regard to the specialized evaluations of functional impairment, symptom severity, and details of clinical features of the service-connected disability at issue. 

The Board has also considered whether staged ratings under Fenderson, supra, are appropriate for the Veteran's service-connected diabetes; however, the Board finds that his symptomatology has been stable throughout the period on appeal. Further, neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with regard to the rating claim adjudicated herein. Doucette, supra.

The competent, probative evidence persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's diabetes. Therefore, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable, and his increased rating claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

4. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for left lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic nerve. 

5. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic nerve.

6. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for and an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for right lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve.

7. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for and an initial rating in excess of 20 percent for left lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerve. 

The Veteran contends entitlement to ratings in excess of 20 precent for left and right lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic nerves (bilateral sciatic peripheral neuropathy). The Veteran also contends entitlement to earlier effective dates for service connection for and initial ratings in excess of 20 percent for right and left lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerves (bilateral femoral peripheral neuropathy). Specifically, the Veteran's representative asserts in a February 2025 brief that service connection for the Veteran's bilateral femoral peripheral neuropathy be awarded effective August 31, 2022, rated as 20 percent disabling each, and that the Veteran's bilateral sciatic peripheral neuropathy be rated as 40 percent disabling each, all based on an April 4, 2023, VA examination. 

The period on appeal starts on August 31, 2022, the date the VA received the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for bilateral peripheral neuropathy plus a one-year look back period. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). For the entire period on appeal, the Veteran's bilateral sciatic peripheral neuropathy is rated as 20 percent disabling each under DC 8520, paralysis of the sciatic nerve. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a. From April 17, 2024, the Veteran's bilateral femoral peripheral neuropathy is rated as 20 percent disabling each under DC 8526, paralysis of the femoral nerve. Id. 

For the award of service connection, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i). The date entitlement arose is the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought; this is determined on a "facts found" basis. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). These "facts found" include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

As it relates to earlier effective dates for the Veteran's bilateral femoral peripheral neuropathy, the question at issue is when did the Veteran's peripheral neuropathy affecting the femoral nerves first manifest within the period on appeal. As further discussed below, resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that his right and left lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerves first manifested on April 4, 2023. 

Under DC 8520, complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve warrants an 80 percent rating and is described as: the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost. 

Severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve, with marked muscular atrophy warrants a 60 percent rating. Moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve warrants a 40 percent rating. Moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve warrants a 20 percent rating. Mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve warrants a 10 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8520. 

Under DC 8526, complete paralysis of the femoral nerve warrants a 40 percent rating and is described as: paralysis of the quadriceps extensor muscles. Severe incomplete paralysis of the femoral nerve warrants a 30 percent rating. Moderate incomplete paralysis of the femoral nerve warrants a 20 percent rating. Mild incomplete paralysis of the femoral nerve warrants a 10 percent rating. Id. at DC 8526. 

Ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124. The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the picture of complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be mild, or at most, moderate. The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves. 

Additional or separate ratings may be warranted for left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy affecting other lower extremity nerves. The Veteran's rating for bilateral femoral peripheral neuropathy is discussed below. As discussed herein, the evidence does not support a finding that the Veteran's right or left lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy affects any other nerves to warrant an additional or separate rating for such. Additional or separate ratings may also be assigned for neuralgia or neuritis affecting the lower extremity nerves. However, here the evidence here does not support a finding that the Veteran also has neuritis or neuralgia affecting the lower extremity nerves. Id. 

The words "mild," "moderate," "severe," and "marked," as used above are not defined in the Rating Schedule. The Board takes judicial notice of the following definitions: "Mild" means not strong in action or effect. "Moderate" means limited in scope or effect. "Severe" means very painful or harmful or of a great degree. "Marked" means having a distinctive or emphasized character.

The Veteran's VA providers periodically examined his feet during the period on appeal as part of his diabetic care. In November 2021 the Veteran's strength was grossly intact with present pedal pulses, normal pulses, and normal sensation. In March 2022 the Veteran received diabetic shoes and compression socks for ongoing swelling or edema of the bilateral feet, which his non-VA nephrologist had described as a chronic stasis change. As noted above, the Veteran ambulated with a rollator walker in 2022. In June 2022 the Veteran denied weakness and sensory loss to a VA provider. On examination the provider noted pedal edema, and the Veteran declined a podiatry referral for his feet. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination for diabetes in September 2022. The VA examiner noted the Veteran had diabetic peripheral neuropathy but did not complete an additional examination for such at that time. In October 2022 the Veteran saw his VA primary care provider who noted his strength and sensation was grossly intact and that his gait was normal. His patellar deep tendon flexes were normal, his gait was normal, and there was no edema. In November 2022 his foot examination showed normal pulses and normal sensation, with no pedal edema and lower extremity peripheral pulses present. There was redness to his bilateral lower extremities and a history of cellulitis at times was noted. In this regard, the Board is cognizant that the Veteran's CAD may also cause swelling and stasis changes of the Veteran's bilateral lower extremities. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination on April 4, 2023. The VA examiner diagnosed bilateral lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The Veteran reported numbness and tingling in his toes, feet, and ankles, which was worse at night with burning pain. He reported mild constant pain and moderate intermittent pain, paresthesia/dysesthesias, and numbness in the bilateral lower extremities. There was reduced strength of the bilateral lower extremities but no atrophy. His deep tendon reflexes were hypoactive at the bilateral knees and absent at the bilateral ankles. His sensation to light touch was normal at the upper anterior thigh and thigh/knee, but it was decreased at the lower leg/ankle and absent at the foot/toes. There were trophic changes with loss of hair extending from the knees to ankles with shiny scaly skin, which is also confirmed in the Veteran's dermatology treatment records around this time. He had a waddling gait due to his diabetic peripheral neuropathy. 

The VA examiner stated there was moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the bilateral sciatic nerves, moderate incomplete paralysis of the common peroneal nerve, and no involvement of the femoral nerve or any other lower extremity nerves. The VA examiner noted the Veteran regularly used a cane for ambulation. The Veteran's ability to work was impacted described as a limitation to a position that did not involve prolonged standing and walking. 

The Veteran saw his VA primary care provider in May 2023. His strength and sensation were grossly intact with normal gait and patellar deep tendon reflects. There was pedal edema bilaterally. He followed up with his primary care provider in September 2023. His sensation was grossly intact with no edema, normal gait, and normal patellar deep tendon reflexes. Pedal pulses were present, and his pulses and sensation were normal on his foot examination. The Veteran requested new diabetic shoes and at the appointment for this the same day, the provider noted there had been conflicting foot exams that day and a qualifying foot examination would need to be completed before the new shoes could be issued. The Veteran saw his primary care provider again in March 2024. He was using a wheelchair but walked with a cane. There was pedal edema on his foot examination, but his pulses were normal with sensation intact. 

The Veteran underwent another VA examination in May 2024. The VA examiner diagnosed bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy. The Veteran reported numbness, sharp pain, and tingling. When asked if his functioning was impacted, the Veteran said it was not. He reported moderate intermittent pain, parasthesia/dysesthesia, and numbness in the bilateral lower extremities. He denied constant pain in the bilateral lower extremities. His bilateral lower extremity strength was reduced, but there was no atrophy. Deep tendon reflexes in the bilateral lower extremities were normal. Light touch sensation was decreased in the foot/toes only and vibration sensation was absent. There were no trophic changes noted. The VA examiner indicated there was moderate incomplete paralysis of the bilateral femoral and sciatic nerves only. 

The Veteran testified at a Board hearing in November 2024 that he had numbness and tingling from his waist to his feet bilaterally for 15 to 16 years. He said the numbness made it hard for him to stand up. He was using a wheelchair at the hearing and said that most of the time he used a cane. He said he drove himself to the hearing. He explained that he mowed the law with a riding mower because he could not use the push mower anymore. He said he could not stand up very long from the numbness in his legs and hip. He said he could stand up for maybe two to three minutes and that he could walk very short distances. He explained that he could not last on his feet all day anymore in a work environment. The Board notes that the Veteran's testimony shows he is able to use foot controls to operate his car and riding mower. 

As noted above, resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds his left and right femoral neuropathy first manifested on April 4, 2023, the date of the VA examination showing hypoactive deep tendon reflexes at the knee and decreased sensation in the lower leg. While the VA examiner described involvement of the bilateral common peroneal nerve on April 4, 2023, the Board finds that the examination findings that day and the record as a whole reflects the Veteran's diabetic peripheral neuropathy affects his bilateral sciatic and femoral nerves and that it does not affect his bilateral common peroneal nerve. 

The common peroneal nerve involves the toes, dorsiflexion of the foot, dorsal flexion of the proximal phalanges, abduction of the foot, adduction of the foot, as well as anesthesia of the entire dorsum of the foot and toes. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8521. These types of findings (dorsiflexion, dorsal flexion of the proximal phalanges, abduction of the foot and adduction) are not seen in the examination findings from April 4, 2023, or elsewhere in the record, which could indicate involvement of the foot separate from the involvement of the sciatic nerve (foot drop, muscles below the knee, flexion of the knee). Rather, resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the examination findings at the April 4, 2023 VA examination, the May 2024 VA examination, and the record as a whole reflect involvement of only the sciatic nerves and the femoral nerves (the quadriceps extensor muscles). Consequently, no separate rating for involvement of the common peroneal nerve is warranted, and a separate rating for involvement of the femoral nerve is warranted from April 4, 2023, but no earlier. 

The record does not support a finding of involvement of the femoral nerve prior to April 4, 2023. The Veteran's 2020 VA examination findings do not show involvement of the femoral nerve, and the Veteran reported that he had gradually begun noticing burning pain in both feet at that time. He did not indicate any involvement of the thigh at that time. He also had not reported any symptomatology related to his thigh to his VA providers during the period on appeal. While the Veteran testified to experiencing symptomatology from his waist to his toes for 15 to 16 years, the Board finds his statements made contemporaneous with medical treatment and VA examinations to be more persuasive given their stronger temporal connection to his actual experience of such symptoms. 

Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board also finds that from April 4, 2023, the Veteran's right and left lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerves is manifest by no more than moderate incomplete paralysis, and his right and left lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic nerves is manifest by no more than moderately severe incomplete paralysis. The evidence does not support findings of severe incomplete paralysis of the bilateral femoral nerves or severe incomplete paralysis with marked muscular atrophy of the bilateral sciatic nerves to warrant higher ratings under DCs 8520 or 8526. The evidence also does not support a finding of moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the bilateral sciatic nerves prior to April 4, 2023, to warrant a higher rating before this date under DC 8520. 

The trophic changes the Veteran experiences in his bilateral lower extremities are not solely due to peripheral neuropathy, but also to chronic stasis changes related to his CAD. The Veteran's strength in the bilateral lower extremities less than normal, but not more severe, nor was there any atrophy of the bilateral lower extremities during the period on appeal. As noted above, the Veteran's ambulation is also significantly affected by his nonservice-connected low back symptoms, as evidenced by his 2020 lay statements asserting his need for a walker was due to low back pain. The Veteran maintains the ability to walk short distances with a cane and use foot control. Applying the benefit-of-the-doubt rule results in attribution of at least part of the Veteran's trophic changes and ambulation difficulties to his bilateral lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Consequently, a rating of 20 percent each for left and right lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the femoral nerves is warranted from April 4, 2023, and a rating of 40 percent each for left and right lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic nerves is warranted from April 4, 2023. 

In making its determinations in this case, the Board has carefully considered the Veteran's contentions with respect to the nature of his service-connected disability at issue and notes that his lay testimony is competent to describe certain symptoms associated with his bilateral lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The Veteran's history and reported symptoms have been considered, including as presented in the medical evidence discussed above, and have been contemplated by the disability rating that has been assigned. Moreover, the competent medical evidence offering detailed specific findings pertinent to the rating criteria is the most probative evidence when evaluating the pertinent symptoms of the service-connected disability at issue. As such, while the Board accepts the Veteran's testimony concerning matters that he is competent to address, the Board relies upon the competent medical evidence with regard to the specialized evaluations of functional impairment, symptom severity, and details of clinical features of the service-connected disability at issue. 

The Board has also considered whether additional staged ratings under Fenderson, supra, are appropriate for the Veteran's service-connected disabilities; however, the Board finds that his symptomatology had been stable from the beginning of the period on appeal until April 4, 2023, and stable after the increase on April 4, 2023, through the end of the period on review. Therefore, additional staged ratings are not warranted. Further, neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with regard to the rating claim adjudicated herein. Doucette, supra.

In reaching the foregoing determinations, the Board has applied the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine and resolved all doubt in the Veteran's favor, which has resulted in the partial awards assigned herein. However, insofar as the Board has denied higher ratings or earlier effective dates, the competent, probative evidence persuasively weighs against such aspects of the Veteran's claims. Therefore, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable, and his rating claims must otherwise be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

8. Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability.

The Veteran contends entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disability from November 30, 2012, as part and parcel of his initial increased rating claim for coronary artery disease (CAD). 

The period on appeal starts on November 30, 2012, the date service connection was awarded for CAD, as the record reflects the Veteran has continuously pursued the issue of the initial rating for such since the AOJ decision awarding service connection was issued and the record reasonably raised the issue of entitlement to a TDIU during the pendency of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c); Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). Specifically, VA advised the Veteran that he may be entitled to a TDIU in January 2024, and he submitted a statement in support of such and a formal application for such in February and March 2024.  

Total disability will be considered to exist when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340. Said another way, a total disability rating for compensation may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16. 

The Board may assign such rating in the first instance, when warranted, only if the Veteran has one service-connected disability rated at 60 percent or more or has multiple service-connected disabilities combining to at least 70 percent with at least one disability rated at 40 percent or more. Id. For purposes of the aforementioned, disabilities resulting from a common etiology are considered as one disability. Id.

If the schedular criteria is not met, the question then becomes whether entitlement to an extraschedular TDIU should be referred to the Director of Compensation Service. The Board must make this referral if there is sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that a Veteran is unemployable because of his service-connected disabilities. Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58 (2019).

The record reflects that as of November 30, 2012, the Veteran was in receipt of service connection for: CAD rated as 10 percent disabling; skin disability rated as 30 percent disabling; right arm disability rated as 10 percent disabling; and pulmonary disability rated as 10 percent disabling. The Veteran's combined rating on November 30, 2012, was 50 percent. 

Effective October 20, 2014, the Veteran's pulmonary disability rating was decreased to noncompensable or zero percent disabling, and his combined rating was 40 percent. 

Effective October 25, 2016, the Veteran was awarded service connection for diabetes mellitus type II rated as 20 percent disabling, bringing his combined rating to 60 percent. 

Effective October 2, 2018, the Veteran's skin disability rating was increased to 60 percent disabling, with a combined rating of 70 percent. This is the first date that the Veteran meets the schedular criteria for a TDIU to be assigned by the Board in the first instance. Prior to this, only extraschedular entitlement to a TDIU is available.   

Effective January 21, 2020, Veteran was awarded service connection for bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic nerves rated as 20 percent disabling each, with a combined rating of 80 percent. 

As awarded herein, the Veteran is in receipt of a 100 percent rating for CAD effective August 3, 2021. The record does not reasonably raise nor has the Veteran or his representative averred entitlement to special monthly compensation above that available under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) or entitlement to a TDIU due to a single service-connected disability. Consequently, the Board finds entitlement to a TDIU is moot as of August 3, 2021. 

As it relates to a TDIU, the Veteran reported in October 2016 that he was a retired machinist. On January 21, 2020, a VA examiner found the Veteran's diabetic peripheral neuropathy affected his ability to work because his paresthesia affected ambulation and interrupted his sleep. In August 2020 the Veteran's VA dermatologist noted his stasis dermatitis was recently exacerbated when his legs swelled up in June. In April 2023, a VA examiner explained that the Veteran's diabetic peripheral neuropathy affected his ability to work and limited him to a position that did not involve standing and walking. 

In March 2023, the Veteran reported that he had last worked as a warehouse clerk in 2000 and that his service-connected skin disability, diabetes, diabetic nephropathy, bilateral lower extremity diabetic peripheral neuropathy, right arm disability, and pulmonary disability all prevented him from securing or following any substantially gainful occupation. In February 2024, the Veteran reported that he was fired from his job in 2000 after taking medical leave for foot surgeries and that he had not worked since then. He said his feet had not been right since 2000. 

In November 2024, the Veteran testified at a Board hearing that he had a high school education and that he stopped working in 2000. He said he took a medical leave for treatment for bone spurs from the warehouse job he had worked for 11 years. He said he did almost everything at that job and that he could not last all day on his feet now. Additional testimony regarding his ability to stand and walk was provided as discussed above. The record also includes additional information regarding the functional impact of the Veteran's skin disability, right arm disability, pulmonary disability, CAD, and diabetes before January 21, 2020, including VA treatment records, non-VA treatment records, the Veteran's lay statements, and several VA examinations, all of which the Board has reviewed and considered.

Upon review, resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds his service-connected disabilities prevented him from securing and following substantial gainful employment from January 21, 2020. The Veteran's assertions clearly support that as of the date service connection was awarded for his bilateral lower extremity disabilities, he was unable to stand and walk as required by the substantial gainful employment for which he was qualified for based on his education, experience, and training, which when combined with his other service-connected disabilities, prevents him from securing and following substantial gainful employment. Consequently, a TDIU is warranted from January 21, 2020, due to his several service-connected disabilities. 

As noted above, the Veteran first met the schedular requirements to allow for the Board to assign a TDIU in the first instance on August 2, 2018, when his skin disability rating was increased to 60 percent. The August 2, 2018, non-VA medical report upon which this rating was awarded stated that the Veteran's skin conditions did not affect his ability to work. Further, the evidence shows the Veteran's diabetes, right arm disability, CAD, and pulmonary disability would not have prevented him from working in employment that he was qualified for based on his education, experience, and training from August 2, 2018, until January 21, 2020. Consequently, a TDIU is not warranted from August 2, 2018, through January 20, 2020. 

The Board also finds that referral to the Director of Compensation Service for consideration of entitlement to an extraschedular TDIU before August 2, 2018, is not warranted. Prior to August 2, 2018, there is not sufficient evidence to substantiate a reasonable possibility that the Veteran was unemployable because of his service-connected disabilities. The evidence before August 2, 2018, does not indicate that the Veteran's ability to work was impacted to a level that provides a reasonable possibility that he was unemployable. The Veteran was clear in his statements that his employment stopped at the same time he was having issues with a nonservice-connected bilateral foot disorder and that he is prevented securing and following substantial gainful employment due to all of his disabilities which were service connected as of January 21, 2020. Overall, the record as a whole does not show that the functional impact of the Veteran's skin disability, right arm disability, pulmonary disability, CAD, and diabetes before August 2, 2018, provides a reasonable possibility that the Veteran was unemployable from November 30, 2012, to August 2, 2018. 

In making its determinations in this case, the Board has carefully considered the Veteran's contentions with respect to the nature of his service-connected disabilities at issue and his ability to work and notes that his lay testimony is competent to describe certain symptoms associated with his several service-connected disabilities. The Veteran's history and reported symptoms and functional impairment have been considered, including as presented in the medical evidence discussed above, and have been contemplated by the award of TDIU herein. Moreover, the competent medical evidence offering detailed specific findings pertinent to Veteran's functional ability and impact on his ability to work as it relates to his several service-connected disabilities is the most probative evidence when evaluating entitlement to a TDIU. As such, while the Board accepts the Veteran's testimony concerning matters that he is competent to address, the Board relies upon the competent medical evidence with regard to the specialized evaluations of functional impairment, symptom severity, and details of clinical features of the service-connected disabilities at issue. 

In reaching the foregoing determinations, the Board has applied the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine and resolved all doubt in the Veteran's favor, which has resulted in the award of a TDIU as of January 21, 2020. However, insofar as the Board has denied entitlement to a TDIU before January 21, 2020, or referral to the Director of Compensation Service for consideration of an extraschedular TDIU before August 2, 2018, the competent, probative evidence persuasively weighs against such aspects of the Veteran's claim. Therefore, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable, and his claim to a TDIU must otherwise be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

9. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s). 

The Veteran contends entitlement to an earlier effective date for special monthly compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) (SMC(s)). 

SMC provided by 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) is payable where the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent and has additional service-connected disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems. 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(j). 

As discussed above and based on the awards herein, the Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated at 100 percent and has additional service-connected disabilities ratable to at least 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems as of August 3, 2021. The Veteran's award of a TDIU herein as of January 21, 2020, is not based on a single disability to allow for payment of SMC(s) as of that date. 

Therefore, the criteria for statutory housebound SMC(s) are met as of August 3, 2021. 38 U.S.C. § 1114; 38 C.F.R. § 3.350.

10. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35.

The Veteran contends entitlement to an earlier effective date for basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35. 

DEA benefits are payable to the child or surviving spouse of a Veteran, who will have basic eligibility if the following conditions are met: (1) the Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the Veteran had a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the Veteran's death; or (4) the Veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807(a).

As discussed above and based on the awards herein, the Veteran is in receipt of a total disability rating from January 21, 2020. Therefore, entitlement to DEA benefits is warranted from January 21, 2020. Id.
