REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from December 1974 to May 1975.  

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2020 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The decision was issued on September 23, 2020.  

In response to the September 2020 rating decision, in September 2021, the Veteran submitted VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) where he selected the Evidence Submission docket.  Under the Evidence Submission docket, the Board considers the claim based on evidence of record at the time of the rating decision, and evidence received within 90 days following receipt of the NOD.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  Thus, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the issuance of the September 2020 rating decision and evidence received within 90 days following receipt of the September 10, 2021 VA Form 10182.  Id.

1. Entitlement to service connection for nerve damage on the right side of the shoulder is dismissed.

2. Entitlement to service connection for nerve damage of the right arm, hand, and fingers is dismissed.

3. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is dismissed.

4. Entitlement to recognition of C.H. as a "helpless child" of the Veteran based on permanent incapacity for self-support prior to attaining the age of 18 is dismissed.

Unfortunately, the Veteran passed away during the pendency of the appeal. Specifically, in [REDACTED] 2023 VA received notice indicating that the Veteran had passed away on [REDACTED], 2023.  As a matter of law, appellants' claims do not survive their deaths.  Zevalkink v. Brown, 102 F.3d 1236, 1243-44 (Fed. Cir. 1996); Smith v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 330, 333-34 (1997); Landicho v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 42, 47 (1994).  

The appeal on the merits has become moot by virtue of the death of the Veteran and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.  

In reaching this determination, the Board intimates no opinion as to the merits of this appeal or to any derivative claim brought by a survivor of the Veteran.

There are provisions in place to allow for an eligible person to take the Veteran's place in his appeal in order to get a final decision.  This process is called substitution.  However, to date a request for substitution has not been filed and the timeline for doing so has passed.

The Board offers its sincere condolences to the Veteran's family and is grateful for his honorable service.
