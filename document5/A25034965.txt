ORDER

Entitlement to a 10 percent rating for hypertension is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least in equipoise that the Veteran's hypertension resulted in a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more with continuous medication for control.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a 10 percent rating for hypertension have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.31, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1967 to May 1970, including service in the Republic of Vietnam from February 1969 to May 1970, and April 1971 to October 1974. His awards and decorations include the Purple Heart and the Combat Infantryman Badge. The Board thanks him for his service to our country.

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the noncompensable rating assigned by an April 2023 decision that granted service connection for hypertension, effective August 10, 2022. A June 2023 decision identified a duty to assist error and the claim was returned for development. In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a supplemental claim decision which denied an initial compensable rating based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the February 2024 decision. In March 2024, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior February 2024 decision. [The Board notes that there is a typographical error in the HLR decision which identifies a March 3, 2024 HLR Request, instead of the March 5, 2024 HLR request]. 

In the February 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. The VA Form 10182 does not identify a decision by date. However, in attached February 2025 correspondence seeking an Advance on the Docket, discussed below, the Veteran states that he was appealing the March 2024 decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board also notes that the Veteran submitted VA treatment records with the VA Form 10182. However, these treatment records are duplicative of evidence in the record at the time of the February 2024 decision on appeal. 

As a final preliminary matter, the Board acknowledges that this decision is being issued prior to the expiration of the period in which the Veteran may elect to switch dockets pursuant to the holding in Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). However, in the February 2025 correspondence attached to the VA Form 10182 the Veteran "respectfully moves this Board to advance the docket" of his case. The correspondence explains that "the veteran is at an advance[d] age of 75 years and needs a timely resolution. A delay in the hearing could adversely affect the veteran since he is of age and is experiencing health issues." The Board construes this motion as a request for the Board to issue its decision as soon as possible without waiting until the period to request to switch dockets elapses.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for hypertension

In general, ratings for service-connected disabilities are determined by comparing the Veteran's symptoms with criteria listed in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based, as far as practically can be determined, on average impairment in earning capacity. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 C.F.R. Part 4. When rating a service-connected disability, the entire history must be borne in mind. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular code, the higher rating is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. An exception to this rule applies when the rating criteria are successive. In such a case, all the requirements of the lower levels must be met before a higher level is awarded, and 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7 and 4.21 do not apply. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245 (2018). After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3. 

With a claim for an increased initial rating, separate staged ratings may be assigned based on facts found. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990). The benefit of the doubt applies when the evidence for and against is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal," but does not apply when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Hypertension is rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101, for hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension). Under Diagnostic Code 7101, a 10 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; it is the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control. A 20 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.

The criteria for a 10 percent rating are disjunctive. See Johnson, supra (only one disjunctive 'or' requirement must be met in order for an increased rating to be assigned). The Board notes that the plain language of Diagnostic Code 7101 contemplates the effects of medication. See McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 273 (2016).

For VA rating purposes, the term hypertension means that the diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90 mmHg or greater. The term isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160 mmHg or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101, Note (1). For VA purposes, hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on at least three different days. Id.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria. Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common." See www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.

The Veteran submitted his claim for service connection for hypertension on September 10, 2022. Nevertheless, the appeal begins August 10, 2022, the effective date of service connection as based on the date of the law change allowing VA to grant service connection. The appeal period ends on February 15, 2024, (the date notification was mailed of the February 2024 decision).

The Veteran contends that his hypertension warrants a compensable rating because VA medical treatment records show a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more and his hypertension requires continuous medication for control. See February 2025 VA Form 10182. The Board agrees that a 10 percent rating is warranted.

VA CAPRI records dated during the appeal period show blood pressure readings of 122/65 in September 2022 and 117/74 in May 2023. 

The Veteran lives in a country other than the United States and is unable to attend VA examinations. He has instead submitted privately completed VA Disability Benefit Questionnaire (DBQ) examination reports for hypertension. 

A June 2023 examination report states that the Veteran was currently prescribed medication for hypertension. The report states he did not have a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevation predominately 100 or more. The report provides blood pressure readings from September and October 2015 which confirmed his original diagnosis of hypertension. Specifically, these readings were 158/100 and 170/92 on September 21, 2015; 158/96 and 160/102 on October 1, 2015; and 131/83 and 140/90 on October 22, 2015. 

VA treatment records reflect Amlodipine was started on October 1, 2015, three weeks prior to the third reading.

A February 2024 examination report states that the Veteran was currently prescribed the same medication at the same dose for hypertension. His blood pressure that day was 114/68. Significantly, the report states that he did have a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevation predominately 100 or more and notes readings of 158/100 and 160/102 prior to medication. VA treatment records reflect Amlodipine was started on October 1, 2015.

The foregoing evidence is at least in equipoise that the Veteran had a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more with continuous medication for control. The April 2024 examination report and VA treatment records support this finding. 

The Veteran does not assert, and the evidence does not show that an even higher rating is warranted as there are no findings of diastolic pressure predominantly 110 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more. 

Accordingly, a 10 percent rating, but no higher, is granted for hypertension. The most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent for hypertension. As the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 10 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.
