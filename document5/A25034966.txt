ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of June 2, 2022, for the grant of service connection for migraine headaches, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. There is no earlier communication, statement, or formal or informal claim dated before the Veteran's June 2, 2022 claim for service connection for migraine headaches. 

2. The AOJ granted service connection for migraine headaches in a September 2023 rating decision, effective August 10, 2022.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an earlier effective date of June 2, 2022, for the award of service connection for migraine headaches have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty in the United States Army from August 1994 to January 2001.

The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the rating decision on appeal in September 2023, which constitutes an initial decision. Therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of June 2, 2022, for the grant of service connection for migraine headaches.

The Veteran is appealing the effective date of the initial grant of service connection for migraine headaches. See September 2024 VA Form 10182 and associated correspondence.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of compensation based on an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. An effective date of an award of service connection is not based on the earliest medical evidence showing a causal connection, but on the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was filed with the VA. Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999). 

The "date of receipt" means the date on which a claim, information or evidence was received by the VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r). A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by the VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). A "claim" means a written communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p); see also, Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009) (holding a claim needs to indicate an intent to apply for benefits and identify the benefit sought).

Here, the AOJ received the Veteran's claim for service connection for migraine headaches on June 2, 2022. It granted service connection for migraine headaches as of August 10, 2022, in its September 2023 rating decision. The Veteran appealed within one year of the September 8, 2023 notice of determination. See September 4, 2024 VA Form 10182.

In the rating decision granting service connection for migraine headaches, the AOJ made the finding that "Service connection for migraine headaches has been established as directly related to military service." See September 2023 rating decision. Nevertheless, it based the effective date of the grant on the date of the law change allowing the grant for service connection for headaches on a presumptive basis. Id. As the AOJ granted service connection on a direct basis, the proper effective date for the award is the date of receipt of the claim. Here, that date is June 2, 2022. No earlier date is warranted, as June 2, 2022 was the earliest communication, statement, or formal or informal claim regarding the migraine headaches. See Brokowski, 23 Vet. App. 79 at 84. Therefore, entitlement to an earlier effective date of June 2, 2022, for the claim of service connection for migraine headaches is granted.
