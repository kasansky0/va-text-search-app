ORDER

Entitlement to an extension of a temporary total rating beyond June 1, 2023, based on surgical or other treatment necessitating convalescence for service-connected right ankle disability, is denied. 

Entitlement to a rating greater than 20 percent for service-connected right ankle disability from June 1, 2023, is denied.

Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for painful right ankle scars is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for right ankle scars, other than painful scars, is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran required convalescence for right ankle surgery after June 1, 2023.

2. From June 1, 2023, the Veteran's right ankle disability has been manifested by pain, swelling, instability and marked limited motion.

3. The Veteran does not have more than two painful right ankle scars. 

4. The right ankle scars are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage and do not exceed an area of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm) or greater.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for the extension of a temporary total rating beyond June 1, 2023, based on the need for convalescence following right ankle surgery have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.30.

2. The criteria for a rating greater than 20 percent for right ankle disability have not been met at any point from June 1, 2023. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271.

3. The criteria for a rating greater than 10 percent for painful right ankle scars have not been met at any point during the appeal period. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804.

4. The criteria for a compensable rating for right ankle scars, other than for painful scars, have not been met at any point during the appeal period. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7802, 7805.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from September 1985 to September 1989.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from September 2023 and January 2024 rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). On the notice of disagreement (NOD) (VA Form 10182) filed in September 2024, the Veteran elected the direct review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider evidence that was of record at the time of the rating decision on appeal. 

In addition to the September 2023 and January 2024 rating decisions identified above which are valid appeals currently before the Board, the Veteran included rating decisions dated in August 2024, April 2024, July 2023, March 2023, November 2019, July 2013, June 2010, October 2008 and April 2006 on the NOD which are not valid appeals. In this regard, the August 2024 rating decision regarding entitlement to service connection for a left ankle disability is the subject of a later NOD filed in September 2024 at which time the Veteran requested the hearing docket. See VA Form 10182 received September 28, 2024. The April 2024 rating decision regarding entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus is not a valid appeal as the NOD was received while a Higher-Level Review Request was pending. See April 28, 2024, Higher Level Review request. The July 2023, March 2023, and November 2019 rating decisions are not valid appeals since the NOD was filed more than one year after these rating decisions were issued thus rendering the appeal of these rating decisions untimely. See 38 C.F.R. §20.203. Lastly, the July 2013, June 2010, October 2008 and April 2006, rating decisions are not valid appeals since legacy decisions are not appealable under the Appeal Modernization Act process. 

I. Temporary Total Rating for Right Ankle Disability Beyond June 1, 2023

Laws and Regulations

A total rating (100 percent) for convalescence is assigned following hospital discharge, effective from the date of hospital admission or outpatient treatment and continuing for a period of 1, 2, or 3 months from the first day of the month following such hospital discharge or outpatient release, if the hospital treatment of the service-connected disability resulted in: (1) surgery necessitating at least one month of convalescence; (2) surgery with severe postoperative residuals such as incompletely healed surgical wounds, stumps or recent amputations, therapeutic immobilization of one major joint or more, application of a body cast, the necessity for house confinement, or the necessity for continued use of a wheelchair or crutches (regular weight bearing prohibited); or (3) immobilization by cast, without surgery, of one major joint or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.30.

Extensions of 1, 2, or 3 months beyond the initial 3 months may be granted under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.30(a)(1), (2), or (3), (noted above) and further extensions of 1 or more months, up to 6 months, may only be made under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.30(a)(2) or (3) (e.g., where there are severe postoperative residuals). 38 C.F.R. § 4.30(b).

A temporary total convalescent rating contemplates only a temporary period required by a veteran to recover from the immediate effects of surgery. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.30. Thereafter, any chronic residual disability is rating under the schedular criteria for the disability.

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has defined convalescence as "the stage of recovery following an attack of disease, a surgical operation, or an injury." Felden v. West, 11 Vet. App. 427, 430 (1998) (citing DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY 415 (30th ed., 2003)). The Court also defined recovery as "the act of regaining or returning toward a normal or healthy state." Id. (citing WEBSTER'S MEDICAL DESK DICTIONARY 606 (1986)). Furthermore, the Court has noted that the term "convalescence" does not necessarily entail in-home recovery. Temporary total ratings for convalescence are payable from the date of entrance into the hospital and are awarded after discharge. 38 C.F.R. § 3.401 (h)(2).

Facts and Discussion

By way of background, in January 2023, the Veteran filed an initial claim for a temporary total rating for right ankle surgery that was performed in January 2023. Records show that the Veteran fractured his right ankle in a fall at work and underwent open reduction with internal fixation of a closed right ankle fracture on January 3, 2023. In a March 2023 rating decision, the AOJ assigned the Veteran a temporary total rating from January 3, 2023, to March 1, 2023, based on the right ankle surgery performed on January 3, 2023, which necessitated convalescence. 

In June 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim requesting a longer convalescent period. He asserted that his surgical notes show that he was off work for five months. Consistent with the Veteran's assertion are private medical records showing that he was cleared to return to full duty work without restrictions on May 12, 2023. These medical records are dated from January 2023 to June 2023 and show that the Veteran was healing well and had no real issues, but he continued to experience pain and swelling in his right ankle. A May 2023 follow up record shows that he was able to return to full duty work with no restrictions. He was advised at that time to wear a compression sock and to continue working on range of motion exercises at home. A June 2023 record shows that the Veteran had done some driving with some increased swelling, but the compression sock had helped. His physician reported that he had reached maximum medical improvement and could do activities as tolerated without restrictions.

In a January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ granted a three-month extension for the Veteran's temporary total rating from March 1, 2023, to June 1, 2023. In short, the evidence neither supports a period of convalescence longer than five months, nor is the Veteran claiming a temporary total rating beyond five months. The follow up post operative records show that the Veteran did not have severe postoperative residuals, and he recovered from the immediate effects of surgery as of May 12, 2023, when his physician cleared him to return to full duty work without restrictions.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against an extension of a temporary total rating for convalescence following right ankle surgery beyond June 1, 2023. As the evidence is persuasively against this claim and is not in approximate balance, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application and the claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

II. Increased Rating for Right Ankle Disability

Rating Criteria

The Veteran's right ankle disability is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271, for limitation of motion of the ankle.

Effective February 7, 2021, VA amended the rating criteria for Diagnostic Code 5271. 85 Fed. Reg. 76,453 (Nov. 30, 2020). Under the new criteria, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate limited motion of the ankle (less than 15 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees plantar flexion). A maximum 20 percent rating is warranted for marked limited motion of the ankle (less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion). Because VA received the Veteran's increased rating claim in January 2023, only the new rating criteria applies.

For reference, normal range of motion of the ankle is from 0 to 45 degrees in plantar flexion and 0 to 20 degrees in dorsiflexion. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate II.

Facts and Discussion

As noted above, the Veteran was assigned a temporary total 100 percent rating for his right ankle disability for the entire appeal period prior to June 1, 2023, followed by a 20 percent rating effective June 1, 2023. Therefore, the issue to be decided is whether he is entitled to a higher than 20 percent rating for his right ankle disability from June 1, 2023. 

Private orthopedic records following the Veteran's January 2023 surgery include a June 2023 record showing that the Veteran was healing well but continued to have pain and swelling in his right ankle. Range of motion was 30 degrees on plantar flexion and 20 degrees on dorsiflexion. The Veteran was noted to be wearing an ankle sleeve. The June 2023 record shows that the Veteran understood that an injury like his was likely to have right ankle pain and swelling for the rest of his life, especially when walking on uneven terrain. 

An August 2023 VA contract ankle examination report shows that the Veteran reported daily flareups of right ankle pain which he described as sharp, stabbing, throbbing, and burning. The flare ups were noted to last two to four hours and were precipitated by overuse, prolonged standing, ambulating, and climbing. Alleviating factors included rest, ice, heat and medication intervention. The examiner assessed the severity of the flareups as moderate. The Veteran was noted to have functional loss due to difficulty with prolonged standing, ambulation and climbing. He reported ankle instability explaining that the ankle "will just buckle". Passive and active range of motion of the right ankle revealed plantar flexion to 15 degrees and dorsiflexion to 5 degrees. Ranges of motion during repetitive use, repeated use, and during flare ups remained the same on plantar flexion but were decreased to 10 percent on dorsiflexion due to pain, fatigability, weakness and lack of endurance. Additional factors that contributed to the disability included interference with standing, disturbance of locomotion, less movement than normal, weakened movement, and instability of station. He regularly used a right ankle brace. He did not have ankylosis or atrophy involving the right ankle. He was noted to have hardware in his ankle. Residuals of his right ankle open reduction surgeries, performed in 1982 and 2023, included limited range of motion, swelling, clicking, popping, and constant pain. The examiner reported that there had been a worsening in the Veteran's right ankle symptoms, but no change in the diagnosis. 

As the Veteran is in receipt of the highest schedular rating for limited motion of the ankle at 20 percent for each ankle, there is no basis to award a higher rating under this diagnostic code.

The Board has considered whether the Veteran would be entitled to a higher rating based on the other diagnostic codes that pertain to the ankle. However, the evidence pertinent to the appeal period from June 1, 2023, shows that the Veteran did not have ankylosis of the right ankle, malunion of os calcis or astragalus, or astragalectomy. As such, higher ratings are not warranted under Diagnostic Codes 5270, 5272, 5273, or 5274.

The Board has also considered whether an extraschedular rating is warranted based on the Veteran's report of continuing pain, swelling and instability. According to 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b)(1), an extraschedular rating is warranted when the regular schedular standards are impractical because the disability is so exceptional or unusual due to such related factors as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization. Although the Board may not assign an extraschedular rating in the first instance, it must specifically adjudicate whether to refer a case for extraschedular evaluation when the issue either is raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record. Barringer v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 242 (2008).

Pain and swelling are considered in the rating criteria and thus, these symptoms are already compensated. Likewise, while there is evidence of ankle instability, the ankle is specifically addressed in the diagnostic codes and there are no provisions for a rating based solely or specifically on ankle instability, but rather such manifestations are encompassed in the ankle ratings as a whole. Unlike the diagnostic codes for the knee, which contain a specific diagnostic code for instability of the knee, the diagnostic codes for the ankle do not contain a separate rating for instability of the ankle. Indeed, the diagnostic codes for the ankle were recently amended and there was no addition of a separate rating for instability of the ankle. Where there is no separate ankle instability diagnostic code, the Board finds that Diagnostic Code 5271, which rates the entirety of the Veteran's ankle disability picture depending on its overall severity, reasonably encompasses the manifestation of instability. The words used in Diagnostic Code 5271, with "moderate" or "marked" limitation, are flexible and meant to broadly capture the severity of the Veteran's ankle disability unless otherwise separated out. Thus, the Board finds the diagnostic code reasonably compensates the Veteran for the entirety of his ankle disability. In sum, the evidence does not reasonably raise the issue of extraschedular referral because it does not suggest that the Veteran's ankle disability is truly unusual or exceptional. The Veteran has failed to allege that conventional rating tools are inadequate, nor does the record otherwise suggest that. See Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111 (2008), aff'd, Thun v. Shinseki, 572 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

For the reasons set forth above, a rating greater than 20 percent for the Veteran's right ankle disability is not warranted at any time during the appeal period from June 1, 2023. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine, however, as the weight of the evidence is persuasively against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable to this claim. 38 U.S.C. §5107(b); Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776. 

III. Increased Rating for Right Ankle Scars

Rating Criteria

Scars are rated under Diagnostic Codes 7800 through 7805 within 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

Under Diagnostic Code 7801, scars not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage warrant a 10 percent rating when they cover an area or areas of at least 39 square centimeters but less than 77 square centimeters. Higher ratings are warranted when the scar covers a larger area or areas.

Under Diagnostic Code 7802, scars not of the face, head or neck that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage warrant a 10 percent rating for an area of 929 square centimeters or greater.

Under Diagnostic Code 7804, a 10 percent rating is warranted for one or two scars that are unstable or painful; a 20 percent rating is warranted for three or four scars that are unstable or painful; a 30 percent rating is warranted for five or more scars that are unstable or painful. 

Note (1) following Diagnostic Code 7804 provides that an unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.

Note (2) following Diagnostic Code 7804 provides that if one or more scars are both unstable and painful, 10 percent is to be added to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars.

Note (3) following Diagnostic Code 7804 provides that scars evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805 may also receive an additional rating under Diagnostic 7804 when applicable. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7804.

Under Diagnostic Code 7805, any disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-04 are to be evaluated under an appropriate Diagnostic Code.

In every instance where VA's rating schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation is assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

Facts and Discussion

A February 2023 VA contract scar examination report shows that the Veteran had two right lower extremity scars, one on the inner aspect of the ankle and one on the outer aspect of the ankle. The scars were noted to be painful, but not unstable. One scar measured 9 centimeters (cm) x .5 cm, and the other scar measured 13 cm x .5 cm. The total combined area of the scars was 11 square cms. Notably, the examiner diagnosed the Veteran as having two scars on his left ankle, but this appears to be in error since the actual examination findings pertain to scars on the right ankle. The examiner noted that the scars do not cause limitation of motion, and they do not affect the Veteran's ability to work. The examiner also reported that there were no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs and/or symptoms associated with the scars.

An August 2023 VA contract scar examination report shows that the Veteran had two right ankle scars, one on the lateral malleolus and one on the medial malleolus. Both scars were noted to be painful with a burning type of pain. The scars measured 11 (centimeters) cm x .25 cm and 8 cm x .25 cm, and covered an approximate total area of 4.75 squared cm. These scars did not cause limitation of motion, were not unstable, and there were no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs and/or symptoms associated with the scars. The examiner also noted that the scars did not affect the Veteran's ability to work. 

The Veteran has been assigned a 10 percent rating for painful scars under Diagnostic Code 7804. This is based on examination findings showing that both scars are painful. As noted, a higher rating of 20 percent requires three or four scars that are unstable or painful, and a 30 percent rating requires five or more scar that are unstable or painful. Id. Here, the findings show a total of two ankle scars. Therefore, a higher rating for painful scars under Diagnostic Code 7804 is not warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

Regarding the separate, noncompensable, rating under Diagnostic Code 7802, as the total area of the right ankle scars do not exceed 144 square inches (929 sq. cm), a compensable, 10 percent, rating under this code is not warranted. See 38 C.F.R. 4.31.

Also, regarding a separate rating under Diagnostic Code 7805, the evidence shows there are no other disabling effects not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-7804. As noted, both examiners found no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs and/or symptoms associated with the scars, including limitation of function. Therefore, a rating under this code is not warranted.

Lastly, with respect to the examination findings discussed above, the Veteran does not argue that the examinations were inadequate or that the examiner's findings were inaccurate, nor has he submitted or identified any other evidence in support of increased and/or separate ratings for these scars.

For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against a higher than 10 percent rating for painful scars and against a compensable rating for scars not of the head, face or neck, not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. 38 C.F.R. §4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7802, 7804. In addition, the evidence is persuasively against a separate rating under any other pertinent diagnostic code. 38 C.F.R. §4.118, Diagnostic Code 7805. As the evidence is persuasively against higher and/or additional ratings for right ankle scars and is not in approximate balance, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application and the claims must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.
