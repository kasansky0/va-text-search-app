ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral plantar fasciitis (also claimed as feet pain) is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for residuals of a right foot fracture is granted.

Entitlement to an evaluation for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) greater than 70 percent is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date before April 23, 1999, for the 70 percent evaluation of PTSD is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran does not have a current or recently diagnosed condition of bilateral plantar fasciitis, to include functional impairment as due to residuals of bilateral plantar fasciitis, within the relevant appeal period.

2. The evidence of record is at least in approximate balance or nearly equal that the Veteran's residuals of a right foot fracture had its onset in or is otherwise etiologically related to military service.

3. The most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that symptoms of the Veteran's PTSD manifest as total occupational and social impairment due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication, persistent delusions or hallucinations, grossly inappropriate behavior, persistent danger of hurting self or others, intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living, including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene, disorientation to time or place, and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.

4. The Veteran's application for service connection of PTSD was received within 1 year after separation from service; therefore, the appropriate date for the award of disability benefits is the day following separation from active service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral plantar fasciitis (also claimed as feet pain) have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1154(a), 5103, 5103A, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310, 3.326, 3.655, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.41.

2. Resolving any doubt in favor of the Veteran, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for residuals of a right foot fracture have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1154(a), 5103, 5103A, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309, 3.310, 3.326, 3.655, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.41.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an evaluation for PTSD greater than 70 percent have not been met.  38 USC §§ 101, 1110, 1154(a), 1155, 5107; 38 CFR 3.102, 3.303(a), 3.307(b), 3.321, 3.326, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.41, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

4. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date before April 23, 1999, for the 70 percent evaluation of PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511, 5104, 5107, 5108, 7105, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.104, 3.156, 3.157, 3.160, 3.400, 3.2500, 19.52, 20.200, 20.1103, 21.412, 21.7302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Army from July 1998 to April 1999, from April 2002 to September 2002, and from July 2007 to March 2010. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  Following a July 2023 claim and July and August 2023 rating decisions, this timely appeal of the denials followed. 

In the notice of disagreement, the Veteran selected the Direct Review option. As a result, the Board's decision on this appeal must be based exclusively on evidence already of record at the time of the rating decision on appeal was issued.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Any evidence added to the record after the rating decision on appeal was issued may be resubmitted along with a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995), however, and if that evidence is new and relevant, it will be considered when the claim is readjudicated.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Instructions concerning supplemental claims are included with this decision.

The Board has thoroughly reviewed and carefully considered the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ rating decision. However, in this decision the Board's focus is on the specific issues at hand and the items of evidence material to resolving those issues. Therefore, failure to reference a particular item of evidence should not be interpreted as an indication it was not reviewed and considered, but rather that it did not significantly affect the outcome of the appeal. See Timberlake v. Gober,14 Vet. App. 122, 129 (2000); Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81(Fed. Cir. 2000); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143, 149 (2001).

The matters are now before the Board for consideration. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral plantar fasciitis (also claimed as feet pain).

Service Connection

Service connection is granted if the evidence shows a claimed disability resulted from an in-service injury or disease. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1132; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

Service connection can be established by simply showing the claimed disability manifested while the Veteran was in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). See also, Flynn v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 500, 503 (1994) (noting "the element of cause and effect has been totally by-passed in favor of a simple temporal relationship between the incurrence of the disability and the period of active duty").  

If the claimed disability did not manifest until after service, direct service connection may nevertheless be established if the evidence sufficiently shows it was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). 

Showing in-service incurrence generally boils down to establishing three essential elements: (1) the claimed disability; (2) an in-service injury, disease, or event occurred; and, (3) a causal relationship, or nexus, between the first two elements. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

When adjudicating appeals, the Board applies an intentionally generous standard of proof unique in American jurisprudence, created in recognition of the nation's great debt to its veterans. Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 531 (2014).  The core of this standard is the benefit of the doubt doctrine.

In making findings and rendering decisions, the Board employs a balancing test of positive and negative evidence. When they are approximately balanced or nearly equal, the benefit of the doubt doctrine entitles the veteran to the benefit of the doubt, and the Board finds in the veteran's favor. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 131, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2001).  

Conversely, if the Board finds the evidence tending to disprove a fact or claim predominates to the point the overall evidentiary picture is persuasively against the veteran, reasonable doubt is extinguished, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply, and the Board finds accordingly.  See, e.g., Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Mattox v. McDonough, 56 F.4th 1369, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

Analysis

In March 2018, the Veteran complained of "right heel pain" and indicated "about 7-8 years ago, she partially ruptured her plantar fascia on her right foot."  See March 2018 VA Podiatry Note.  The Veteran complained of "[l]eft heel pain" in February 2019.  See February 2019 VA Podiatry Note.  A February 2019 VA treatment note diagnosed "plantar fasciitis, left foot" and provided a history of "about 5 years."  See February 2019 VA Podiatry Note.  The underwent a "plantar fascial release on the left foot" in February 2020 and stated that she was "pain-free."  See March 2020 VA Podiatry Telephone Encounter Note; see also November 2020 VA OB/ GYN Secure Messaging; July 2023 VA Foot Conditions examination report.

While the Veteran does not have current diagnoses of plantar fasciitis or a right foot fracture, the VA has conceded the existence of a foot-related disability, and an in-service right foot injury. See August 2023 Rating Decision narrative. Though that diagnosis is more pertinent to the Veteran's other foot-related disability-residuals of a right foot fracture-the Board finds that between that diagnosis and the previous diagnosis of plantar fasciitis, and in light of the above-mentioned benefit of the doubt doctrine, a current disability has been established. 

Therefore, the key hurdle to service connection in this instance is not the lack of a diagnosis-the Board could simply recharacterize the disability as "right foot metatarsalgia with plantar and retrocalcaneal spur." DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 53 (2011); see Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009); see also Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79 (2009). Moreover, the Board need not find any particular condition has been established to satisfy the first element, because the VA disability compensation system does not actually compensate veterans for their physical or mental conditions per se, but rather for the effects those conditions have on their ability to function and their earning capacity after service.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1, 4.2, 4.10. See also, Clemons, 23 Vet. App. at 4; Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (holding under 38 U.S.C. § 1110, "disability" refers to functional impairment of earning capacity, not the underlying injury or disease causing that impairment).  Thus, with sufficient information concerning the impairment involved, "sore feet" can qualify as a disability.

Additionally, the VA conceded in-service foot-related injuries. See August 2023 Rating Decision Narrative. See also, December 1998 and February 1999 Automated Versions of SF600, and December 1998 and January 1999 Department of the Army Memoranda.  Therefore, the Board finds the second element-an in-service injury-has also been established.

Unfortunately, there is no evidence supporting a finding of the causal relationship between the in-service injury and the existing disability.  Lacking any medical evidence of a nexus, lay evidence of continuing symptoms from service to the point of diagnosis, or any other evidence bridging the temporal and medical gaps between the Veteran's in-service foot pain and her current symptoms she has attributed to plantar fasciitis, the Board would have to manufacture the missing element whole cloth to find service connection here. Thus, the evidence is persuasively against the claims, and this appeal must be denied.  

However, in this situation, a denial provides finality as to this appeal, but not necessarily as to the underlying claim, because the claim will be readjudicated by the AOJ if the Veteran submits a supplemental claim along with new and relevant evidence. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A) and (B) (while a veteran may not pursue both a Board appeal and a supplemental claim simultaneously, there is no prohibition on doing so in succession); 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.2501 (the AOJ will readjudicate a claim if new and relevant evidence is submitted with a supplemental claim).

In this case, examples of new and relevant evidence might include a nexus opinion from a qualified clinician, a "buddy statement" from someone aware of the persistence of the Veteran's foot-related symptoms after service, or a more detailed description from the Veteran of her medical and functional history as it pertains to the symptoms she has attributed to plantar fasciitis.

Additionally, the Board observes if the Veteran submits a supplemental claim within one year of this decision, that claim will constitute "continuous pursuit" of the issue, and therefore the date of his original claim, not the new supplemental claim, will apply for purposes of determining the effective date of any award of benefits based on the readjudication. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1) (under the AMA, the date of the initial claim applies so long as the Veteran "continuously pursues" the benefit in question by timely and properly filing an appeal or other administrative review option after a VA decision on the initial claim); Calhoun v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 96, 103 (2024) (the concept of continuous pursuit applies to supplemental claims submitted after Board decisions as well as to those submitted after AOJ decisions).

2. Entitlement to service connection for residuals of a right foot fracture.

Analysis

As noted above, the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability of the right foot.  See July 2023 VA Foot Conditions examination report ("[x] Metatarsalgia"); see also July 2023 IMA Group Radiology Report ("Plantar and retrocalcaneal spurs.").  The first element of service connection is satisfied.  

Also as noted above, the Veteran was treated for foot pain numerous times during service.  See December 1998 and February 1999 Automated Versions of SF600 and December 1998 and January 1999 Department of the Army Memoranda.  The second element of service connection is satisfied.

While there is no medical evidence of a nexus between the in-service disability and the existing disability, there is evidence her symptoms persisted after the Veteran separated from active duty.  See March 2018, February 2019, and March 2020 VA Podiatry Notes and July 2023 VA Foot Conditions examination report.

The Board notes statements provided in a patient-to-provider context are considered particularly reliable, credible, and probative because of the obvious motive to be truthful, accurate, and complete when seeking medical diagnosis or treatment, to the extent there is a hearsay exception for such statements in Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4).  

Conclusion

Given the objective medical evidence of record, the Veteran's statements, and the benefit of the doubt doctrine, the Board finds a causal relationship between the existing right foot disability and the Veteran's in-service injuries has been established.  Service connection is warranted, and this appeal is granted.

3. Entitlement to an evaluation for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) greater than 70 percent.

Evaluation of Disabilities

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  Ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

If the criteria and the facts are such that two different ratings are potentially applicable to the disability in question, the lower of those ratings must be assigned unless the veteran's disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the higher rating.?38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

However, in keeping with the VA's overarching pro-veteran approach to claim adjudication, if there is any reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability, that doubt will be resolved in the veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

If the severity of a disability fluctuates over time, the VA may assign multiple ratings to cover different periods. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Breland v. McDonough, 22 F.4th 1347, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2022). See also, O'Connell v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 89, 93 (2007) (assigning multiple ratings is a "sensible mechanism" for ensuring precision while simultaneously accounting for the "dynamic nature" of a disability). This process is commonly referred to as "staging" the ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999).

When staging ratings, the VA considers the evidence pertaining to the entire period on appeal, assigns a rating to reflect the level of disability for each distinct period, and then assigns the effective dates for each rating. Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 127; Hart, 21 Vet. App. at 509. The effective date of a staged rating generally corresponds to the date that level of disability initially became evident. Swain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 219, 224 (2015).

Analysis

The Veteran was granted service connection for PTSD in an October 1999 rating decision, with a noncompensable rating.  In October 2017, the rating was increased to 70 percent, effective August 31, 2017, the date of her claim for increase.  Another staged rating was provided in March 2023, with a 50 percent rating before February 15, 2007, a noncompensable rating before August 31, 2017, and a 70 percent rating thereafter.  

Following a July 2023 claim for additional increase, the 70 percent rating was proposed to be decreased to 50 percent.  A July 2023 rating decision resulted in an earlier effective date for the grant of her 70 percent rating.  The Veteran's evaluation now reflects a continuous 70 percent rating from April 23, 1999.  The Veteran continues to seek a total rating for her PTSD.

The Veteran's PTSD was evaluated using 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Schedule of ratings - mental disorders, General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.  According to the Formula, a 70 percent rating is for occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.  

A 100 percent rating is for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  

When adjudicating psychiatric claims, the Board has an obligation to conduct a three-part "holistic" analysis: 1) assess the "severity, frequency, and duration of the signs and symptoms" of the Veteran's condition; 2) quantify "the level of occupational and social impairment caused by those signs and symptoms;" and 3) assign an "evaluation that most closely approximates that level of occupational and social impairment."  See Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); see also Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112 (2013) (holding that the disability rating schedule for psychiatric disabilities reflects "objectively-observable symptomatology," and "it is the severity of the effects of the symptoms as described by the examiner that determines the rating.").  

The listed symptoms are not a checklist, but rather "serve as examples of the type and degree of symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating."  See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002).  

Assessing the "severity, frequency, and duration of the signs and symptoms" of the Veteran's condition and quantifying "the level of occupational and social impairment caused by those signs and symptoms," the Veteran reports "more distress due to her husband using drugs and alcohol" and "has high anxiety when home and spouse is around."  However, she states that she "feels fine when out of the home."  She maintains regular contact with her adult children.  The Veteran works part-time as an EMT, manages a gym, works out regularly, is taking classes, and plans to continue her education in health sciences.  While she reports "trauma-related sleep disturbance," she endorses an average of 6 to 7 hours of sleep per night.  See April and June 2020 VA Consults, November 2021, December 2021, February 2022, and July 2023 VA Psychiatry Notes, and July 2023 VA Review PTSD examination report.

The Veteran has not been observed to have any difficulty with personal grooming or self-care, including appropriate attire.  Communication, including eye contact, attention, and concentration, are appropriate.  She is alert and oriented, with no evidence of motor disturbance or fluctuation of consciousness, and recent / remote memory appears to be intact.  Thought processes are intact, linear, and logical, with no hallucinations, paranoia, or delusions apparent.  She denies suicidal or homicidal ideation and intent.  See November 2021, December 2021, February 2022, and July 2023 VA Psychiatry Notes and July 2023 VA Review PTSD examination report.

Regarding the assignment of an "evaluation that most closely approximates that level of occupational and social impairment," the Board finds sufficient frequency and impairment due to symptoms of an acquired psychiatric disorder continue to warrant an evaluation of 70 percent.  Indeed, the Veteran reported to the July 2023 VA examiner that the 70 percent rating "was very fair."  See November 2021, December 2021, February 2022, and July 2023 VA Psychiatry Notes and July 2023 VA Review PTSD examination report.

Conclusion

The Board has not overlooked the Veteran's statements regarding the severity of her PTSD, and the Board recognizes that the Veteran's mental health condition significantly impairs her ability to function, but that is reflected in her existing 70 percent rating. See, e.g., Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993) ("A high rating in itself is a recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain and keep employment"). 

However, the medical evidence of record demonstrates gainful employment and relationships with family, and thus it is persuasively against a finding of such limited occupational and social impairment as to associate her symptoms with the criteria in a 100 percent evaluation.  Therefore, as to this issue, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Ortiz, 274 F.3d at1365; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82; Mattox, 56 F.4th at 1378-79.

In summary, the Board finds that a 70 percent disability rating adequately contemplates the symptoms of the Veteran's PTSD.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the overall disability picture demonstrated by the record to arrive at the appropriate evaluation in this case. This appeal is denied.

The Board notes if the Veteran's symptoms become more severe in the future, she may qualify for a 100 percent rating based on a new claim for an increase.

4. Entitlement to an effective date before April 23, 1999, for the 70 percent evaluation of PTSD.

Effective Dates of Claims

The effective date for service connection is generally the day following separation from active service provided the claim is received within one year after separation from service. Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement to service connection arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i). 

The effective date cannot be earlier than the day following separation from service, because for VA disability purposes, a "veteran" is someone who "served," past tense, in the "active military, naval, or air service," and was then "discharged or released therefrom...." See 38 U.S.C. § 101(2). 

Analysis

The Veteran separated from service on April 22, 1999.  See April 1999 DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty.  Service connection for PTSD was granted in an October 1999 rating decision, with an effective date of April 23, 1999.

Conclusion

Regarding effective date, the Veteran is already in receipt of the maximum benefit that can be supported by law. Therefore, the appeal must be denied.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
