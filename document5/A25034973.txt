REMANDED

Entitlement to an annual clothing allowance for calendar year 2022 is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1965 to February 6, 1966, and from February 9, 1966, to February 1967.

In July 2022, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket. The notice of disagreement (NOD) is partially illegible. To the extent that the NOD can be understood, the Veteran is appealing the denial of a clothing allowance for calendar year 2022.

The record is missing a significant amount of documentation concerning a clothing allowance for calendar year 2022. The claims file does not contain a copy of the initial claims application, any applicable notice letters, VHA prosthetics records, or any pre-decisional evidence submitted or developed in relation to the claim. The substantive decision by the VHA is also missing from the claims file. 

As these pertinent documents are missing from the file, the Board does not have a complete record on which basis it can fulfill its statutory and regulatory duty to render a decision on the Veteran's claim. Therefore, remand is warranted for the AOJ to reconstruct the record and associate with the claims file all relevant clothing allowance records.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Associate with the electronic claim file all evidence considered in connection with the claim on appeal.

The record should include (but is not limited to): the Veteran's application for a clothing allowance for 2022, the associated 2022 VHA decision, and any other relevant documents received or generated in connection with the claim, to include any VHA or prosthetics records.

2. If any such records are unable to be located, the AOJ should make a formal finding of unavailability and provide the appellant with notice of the unavailability of records.
