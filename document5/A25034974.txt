ORDER

Service connection for rheumatoid arthritis is granted.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for headaches is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disorder, other than rheumatoid arthritis, is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's rheumatoid arthritis is related to his military service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for rheumatoid arthritis are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from February 1968 to October 1970, to include service in the Republic of Vietnam.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued on March 19, 2024, April 2, 2024, and April 9, 2024.  In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the issuance of the March 19, 2024, April 2, 2024, and April 9, 2024 decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty from active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110.  Generally, the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that which is pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

The Veteran asserts that his rheumatoid arthritis is related to herbicide agent exposure during his service in the Republic of Vietnam. 

As an initial matter, the Board notes the March 2024 rating decision made the favorable findings that the Veteran had rheumatoid arthritis and that he had herbicide agent exposure during his service in the Republic of Vietnam.  The Board is bound by these findings absent clear and unmistakable error, which is not present. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

Accordingly, this claim turns on whether there is a nexus between the Veteran's rheumatoid arthritis and service.  After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection is warranted.  Specifically, in January 2024 a VA clinician opined the Veteran's rheumatoid arthritis was at least as likely as not caused by the Veteran's toxic exposure risk activity (hereinafter TERA).  The clinician explained that [a]lthough not yet proven as a definitive cause of RA [rheumatoid arthritis], significant evidence exists to support a connection between exposure to Agent Orange and subsequent development of autoimmune diseases, including RA [rheumatoid arthritis].  Therefore, it was at least as likely as not the Veteran's rheumatoid arthritis was caused by service in Vietnam, after considering total potential exposure through military deployments and the combined synergistic effects of all TERA for the veteran.  In support of the opinion, the clinician cited treatise evidence. 

Considering the uncontradicted positive nexus opinions of record, service connection for rheumatoid arthritis is warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Combee v. Principi, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Regarding the Veteran's headache claim, the Board finds the evidence of record prior to the decision on appeal indicated that an addendum opinion was required.  Specifically, although the April 2024 clinician noted that medications could trigger headaches, the clinician did not address whether the Veteran's headaches were secondary to the medications he took for his service-connected hypertension.  See e.g. April 2024 VA addendum.  See also December 2023 VA hypertension examination (noting the Veteran's hypertension was treated with "Lovastatin, Lisinopril/HCTZ, Metoprolol").  Accordingly, the Board finds a remand is required to correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error.  See Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008), aff'd sub nom. Robinson v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (recognizing VA's duty to consider all issues raised either by the claimant or by the evidence of record); See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007); Kowalski v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 171, 179 (2005) (a VA examination must be based on an accurate factual premise).

Regarding the Veteran's lumbar spine claim, although a VA opinion was obtained in March 2024, the clinician did not address or acknowledge the Veteran's assertions regarding wear and tear from his in-service duties.  See October 21, 2019 statement (noting that his military occupational specialty (MOS) was as a heavy equipment operator, which "involved debilitating motions including stooping, bending, heavy lifting" and climbing).  The Veteran's service records confirm that his MOS was as a heavy vehicle driver.  See DD Form 214.  Accordingly, the Board finds the Veteran's reports regarding his in-service duties is consistent with the nature and circumstances of his service.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a).  Accordingly, the Board finds that an opinion was warranted to address the Veteran's assertions regarding wear and tear from his in-service duties.  Accordingly, a remand is warranted to correct his pre-decisional duty to assist error.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007)

The matters are REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Forward the claims file to a VA clinician to obtain an addendum opinion regarding the Veteran's claim for headaches.  If an examination is deemed necessary to respond to the questions presented, one should be scheduled.  Following review of the claims file, the clinician should opine:

(a)	Whether any headache disorder began during military service or is otherwise the result of military service, including or due to any toxic exposures as a result of his service in the Republic of Vietnam.   

In providing this opinion, the clinician is asked to consider total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran.

(b)	Whether any headache disorder was caused by the Veteran's service-connected hypertension and/or any medication taken for his service-connected hypertension?

(c)	If not caused by the service-connected hypertension, is any headache disorder aggravated (i.e., worsened) by his service-connected hypertension and/or any medication taken for his service-connected hypertension?

In addressing the above requested opinions, the clinician should address any statements regarding onset of symptomatology as well as any statements regarding continuity of symptomatology since onset and/or since discharge from service.  

A complete rationale should be provided for all opinions and conclusions expressed.

2. Forward the claims file to a VA clinician to obtain an addendum opinion regarding the Veteran's lumbar spine claim.  If an examination is deemed necessary to respond to the questions presented, one should be scheduled.  

Following review of the claims file, the clinician should opine whether any lumbar spine disorder, other than rheumatoid arthritis, including the documented diagnosis of a lumbosacral strain, began during military service or is otherwise the result of military service, to include as due to his in-service back pain and/or due to wear and tear from the Veteran's in-service duties and/or as a result of his in-service physical training.

In addressing the above requested opinions, the clinician should address any statements regarding onset of symptomatology as well as any statements regarding continuity of symptomatology since onset and/or since discharge from service.  

A complete rationale should be provided for all opinions and conclusions expressed.
