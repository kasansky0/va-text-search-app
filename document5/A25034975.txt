REMANDED

Entitlement to eligibility to enroll in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)'s Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1988 to June 1997.  

In January 2022, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Direct Review docket to review a December 2020 decision by a VA Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301.  

Decisions as to eligibility under a Caregiver Program have been held to be subject to Board review.  See Beaudette v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 95, 105 (2021).  The deadline to file the VA Form 10182 within one year from the date of the decision on appeal does not apply to PCAFC decisions issued by the VA prior to September 28, 2021; this is because those PCAFC decisions were issued without appeal rights to the Board.  As such, while this appeal extends from a 2020 decision, the 10182 was filed in 2022 and pursuant to Beaudette, it is timely.

The Veteran in this case has been assigned a disability rating of at least 70 percent since 2017.  The application at issue was received by VA in December 2020.  The AOJ denied the claim that same month because the serious injury for which the Veteran is service connected was incurred prior to September 11, 2001, which meant he was not eligible for PCAFC benefits at that time.  The AOJ undertook no further action on the claim and did not deny the claim on any alternative eligibility criteria.

At the time of the decision on appeal, veterans with serious injuries incurred prior to September 11, 2001, were not eligible for PCAFC benefits.  Since the initial decision, all periods of service have now become eligible.  The Board notes that VA MISSION Act of 2018 expanded PCAFC eligibility to include Veterans from all service eras, effective on October 1, 2020, that was phased in.  38 U.S.C.  § 1720G(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 71.20(a)(2).  Effective October 1, 2022, individuals with serious injuries incurred during the Veteran's service period were eligible if they met all requirements outlined in 38 C.F.R. § 71.20.  Therefore, such is no longer a threshold bar to basic eligibility for PCAFC.

Because the serious injury incurred by this Veteran now meets the criteria for PCAFC eligibility, remand is warranted to satisfy the regulatory and statutory duties under 38 U.S.C. § 1720G and 38 C.F.R. § 71.20 as such has a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).
