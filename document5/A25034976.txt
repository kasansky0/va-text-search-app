REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty for training (ACDUTRA) from October 2001 to March 2002, active duty from September 2002 to February 2003, and ACDUTRA from January 2004 to April 2004. He had additional service in the Air National Guard from August 2003 to December 2006. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR) and requested review of a November 2023 rating decision.  In April 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior November 2023 decision.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  The Veteran listed the June 2021 rating decision that denied service connection for lumbar spine, cervical spine, and undiagnosed illness. A Veteran has one year from the date on which the AOJ issued a notice of a decision on a claim or issue to appeal to the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (a)(1).  Therefore, the 10182 is untimely with respect to the issues in the June 2021 rating decision. The Veteran also listed the November 2023 rating decision that denied service connection for the lumbar spine. However, it appears based on the sequence of events and the content of the filings there was a clear intent to appeal the November 2023 denial of service connection for the cervical spine as well.  Therefore, the Board has elected to interpret the May 2024 Notice of Disagreement as appealing both issues.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to service connection for lumbar and cervical spine disabilities, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a lumbar spine disability 

2. Entitlement to service connection for cervical spine disability

As a preliminary matter, remand is required to provide the Veteran with notice of a right to a hearing before VA issues a notice of a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (d)(1).  VA Form 20-0995 was amended in May 2024.  The form now informs the claimant of the right to a hearing during the claims process, to include a pre-decisional hearing if the Veteran requests one.  On June 28, 2023, the Veteran submitted a signed September 2022 version of VA Form 20-0995 which did not contain language informing the Veteran of his right to a hearing at any time during the claims process.  Therefore, remand is required for the AOJ to provide adequate notice to the Veteran of his right to a hearing under 38 C.F.R. § 3.106 (b)(1), (d)(1).

The Veteran contends that his lumbar spine and cervical disabilities are caused by the gradual wear and tear of carrying heavy equipment and doing strenuous activities during active service. Specifically, with the Army as an infantryman and with the Air Force as a firefighter. He further stated that "[w]hen I got out of the military and DOD I had chronic neck pain and had ignored it for a while."  June 2023 21-4138 Statements in Support of Claim.

The Veteran served as an Infantryman while in the Army National Guard.  The Veteran served as a Fire Protection Apprentice while in the Air National Guard.

The record shows that the Veteran worked as a civilian firefighter for the Department of Defense from 2003 to 2016.  August 2019 Initial Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Disability Benefits Questionnaire.

The RO made favorable findings that the Veteran has currently diagnosed lumbar spine and cervical spine disabilities.

Service treatment records are silent for any symptoms, treatment, or diagnosis of a lumbar or cervical spine disability.  In the September 2001 entrance examination, the Veteran had a normal spine examination.  In the accompanying Report of Medical History, the Veteran denied any recurrent back pain or any back problem.  In the September 2003 Report of Medical Examination, the Veteran had a normal spine examination.  In the accompanying Report of Medical History, the Veteran denied any recurrent back pain or any back problem.

In a private December 2020 opinion, Dr. T.L. noted that the Veteran had been employed as a firefighter and EMT "for many years."  Dr. T.L. found that the Veteran's time employed as a firefighter and EMT contributed to his diagnoses of cervical and lumbar disc degeneration, and he "suspect[s] that they likewise contributed to his ultimate need for surgery."

The Veteran underwent VA lumbar spine and cervical spine examinations in March 2021.  The Veteran was diagnosed with lumbar fusion, degenerative disc disease, and osteoarthritis of the lumbar spine as well as cervical discectomy, osteoarthritis, and degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine.  The Veteran reported developing neck and lower back pain after years of carrying heavy ruck sacks.  He contends that his lower back pain began in 2002 or 2003 and his neck pain began in 2004.  Over time, he began to notice pain radiate down his left upper arm and lower leg.  The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's lumbar fusion, degenerative disc disease, and osteoarthritis and cervical discectomy, osteoarthritis, and degenerative disc disease are less likely than not incurred in or caused by the Veteran's active service because no neck or low back condition was noted while the Veteran was in service.

The RO then obtained TERA examinations. The Veteran reported neck and back pain from carrying a heavy ruck sack while in the Army and wearing fireman's equipment while in the Air Force.  He stated that his lower back pain began in 2003 and his neck pain began in 2004.  

Dr. T.L. provided another private opinion in January 2023.  In that opinion, Dr. T.L. found that the "rigorous physical requirements of being active duty" is "related" to the Veteran's spine degeneration.  Dr. T.L. also found that "more likely than not his time in the service is the cause of his disc degeneration, stenosis, and subsequent surgeries."

The Veteran underwent additional VA lumbar spine and cervical spine examinations in October 2023.  The Veteran was diagnosed with lumbar fusion with degenerative disc disease, osteoarthritis, and spinal stenosis as well as cervical discectomy and fusion with osteoarthritis, degenerative disc disease, and spinal stenosis.  The Veteran reported having issues with his back for 20 to 25 years.  He reported his pain as aching.  He also reported tingling and numbness if he lies on his right side as well as tingling in his legs if he stands too long.  The Veteran reported stiffness in his neck with limited range of motion.  The VA examiner opined that the Veteran's service treatment records did not reveal any treatment for a cervical or low back condition.  The Veteran's first complaint of neck or back pain was in 2018.  The VA examiner also considered that the Veteran had worked for "many years" as a firefighter and EMT, which are strenuous jobs that can place a lot of mechanical stress on multiple joints.  The examiner opined that "the Veteran's condition is likely due to increased activity over a course of many years" and that it is less likely than not that his lumbar or cervical spine disability is caused by any in-service injury or event.

The Board finds that the opinions of Dr. T.L. are inadequate for VA compensation purposes.  In his December 2020 opinion, Dr. T.L. found that the Veteran's employment as a firefighter and EMT "for many years" contributed to his lumbar and cervical disk degeneration.  However, the physician's rationale did not distinguish between the Veteran's active-duty service as a firefighter and his civilian life in the same profession.  In the January 2023 opinion, Dr. T.L. first opined that he "suspects" the rigorous physical requirements while on active duty and the disk degeneration are "related" and then opines that "more likely than not" the Veteran's time in the service caused disk degeneration and stenosis.  This rationale is insufficient. Also, there is no indication that this provider considered the Veteran's three active service periods.

The Board also finds the March 2021 and October 2023 VA opinions to be inadequate for VA compensation purposes because each relied on a lack of in-service treatment records. While the March 2021 opinion was based on the Veteran's three active service periods, the October 2023 was not. Further, the October 2023 examiner found that the Veteran's neck and back pain did not start until 2015 and did not address the Veteran's lay report that his lower back pain began in 2002 or 2003 and his neck pain began in 2004.  

In addition, it is unclear if any of the examiners considered the three periods of active service.

VA must provide an examination that is adequate for VA compensation purposes. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).  An opinion that relies on the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence is inadequate.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

The failure to obtain an adequate opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  Therefore, remand is required.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Provide the Veteran and his representative notice of a right to a hearing pursuant to 38 CFR §§ 3.103 (b)(1) and (d)(1).

2. Obtain an opinion, preferably with a clinician who has not previously examined the Veteran or provided an opinion.  A copy of this Remand and the claims file should be provided to the examiner, and the report must reflect that the claims file was reviewed. If the clinician determines that an examination is warranted then one should be scheduled. The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following:

(a.) Identify all currently diagnosed lumbar spine conditions since the date of claim in June 2023.

(b.) For each currently diagnosed lumbar spine condition, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to his active service?

(c.) Identify all currently diagnosed cervical spine conditions since the date of claim in June 2023.

(d.) For each currently diagnosed cervical spine condition, is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to his active service?

The Veteran had active service from October 2001 to March 2002 (infantryman), September 2002 to February 2003 (infantryman), and January 2004 to April 2004 (firefighter).

The Veteran worked as a civilian firefighter for the Department of Defense from 2003 to 2016.

The examiner must specifically address the Veteran's lay report that his lower back pain began in 2002 or 2003 and his neck pain began in 2004.  

The examiner must specifically discuss the Veteran's duties as firefighter and infantryman during his three periods of active service (listed above), as well as his June 3, 2023 Statements in Support of Claim. To the extent possible, please distinguish if any currently diagnosed lumbar and cervical spine disability is related to his civilian service or military service.

The examiner is reminded that an opinion based on lack of documented treatment during active service, or after active service, by itself is sufficient.

A complete rationale for any opinion is required.
