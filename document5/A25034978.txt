ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the bilateral hearing loss disorder is attributable to service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria to establish entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1154, 5103, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from March 1992 to January 1996. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 higher-level review (HLR) rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

By way of history, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a January 2024 rating decision through which it continued an earlier denial of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss. The Veteran filed a request for HLR of that decision, see March 2024 VA Form 20-0996; the AOJ then issued the July 2024 HLR rating decision on appeal.  

In a July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

The Board notes the Veteran has the right to select a different Board review option by submitting a new VA Form 10182 within one year from the date the AOJ mailed the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, whichever date is later. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); see Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). Although the period to change dockets per 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) has not yet elapsed, the issue on appeal is being granted in full and therefore, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding to adjudicate the appeal. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss that he asserts is etiologically related to in-service exposure to hazardous noise during military service. See September 2022 VA Form 20-0995.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

Generally, to establish service connection a claimant must show (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred in or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement. See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; see also Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). A disability that is proximately due to, the result of, or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury shall be service connected. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

Service connection may also be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

In addition, for veterans who have served 90 days or more of active service during a war period or after December 31, 1946, certain chronic disabilities, including other organic diseases of the nervous system, are presumed to have been incurred in or aggravated by service if they manifested to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of separation from service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

For the showing of chronic disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. As hearing loss is considered a chronic disease for VA compensation purposes, if chronicity in service is not established, a showing of continuity of symptoms after discharge may support the claim. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015) (acknowledging hearing loss as an "organic disease of the nervous system" to the list of disabilities explicitly recognized as "chronic" in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a)).

Presumptive service connection may satisfy the requirements of both an in-service event and a nexus to military service. 

Consistent with VA's duty to maximize benefits, however, see 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(a), the availability of presumptive service connection for a disability does not preclude a veteran from establishing service connection with proof of direct causation. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120 (2007); see also Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case, and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, hearing loss is considered a disability for VA compensation purposes when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.

The Board notes that in the July 2024 higher-level review (HLR) rating decision, the AOJ made several favorable findings. Under the AMA, the Board is bound by the AOJ's favorable findings in the absence of clear and unmistakable error. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

Regarding the first element of service connection, current disability, the AOJ found the Veteran has a current diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes. Thus, the first element of service connection is met. See July 2024 HLR Rating Decision; see 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

The AOJ also conceded a high probability of in-service hazardous noise exposure based on the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) of machine gunner. Accordingly, the second element of service connection is satisfied. See July 2024 HLR Rating Decision; see 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The crux of the case therefore turns on whether there is a causal relationship between the Veteran's current bilateral hearing loss disability and his in-service hazardous noise exposure. 

As an initial matter, the Board observes that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms and experiences observable by his senses, and to that extent, his lay testimony is competent and credible. See July 2021 Veteran Lay Statement. But the evidence of record does not suggest that the Veteran possesses the requisite training or credentials needed to render a competent opinion as to medical diagnosis or etiology. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007). As such, the Veteran's statements do not constitute competent medical evidence and to that extent, lack probative value. 

In this case, an audiogram was administered at the Veteran's entry into service; that audiogram served as the reference audiogram for the duration of the Veteran's active-duty career. See March 1992 STR. The March 10, 1992, audiogram showed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 05	00	20	00	00

LEFT	05	05	00	05	25

See id. 

Five days prior to the Veteran's separation from service, on December 28, 1995, an in-service audiogram was administered and showed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	 05	10	05	10	05

LEFT	05	05	00	05	00

See December 1995 STR. 

The entry and separation audiogram results indicate a minus 15-decibel shift at 2000 Hertz in the right ear and a minus 25-decibel shift at 4000 Hertz in the left ear. 

Under Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction 6055.12 Hearing Conservation Program, a significant threshold shift is defined as an average plus or minus 10-decibel shift in hearing between 2000 to 4000 Hertz in either ear when compared to a reference. See DoD Instruction 6055.12 § 3.8(f). A 15-decibel shift at any one frequency is not considered a significant threshold shift, but it is still regarded as "an early warning sign of permanent hearing loss." See id. at § 3.8(g). 

Thus, although the March 1992 and December 1995 audiograms do not demonstrate a significant threshold shift in either ear, see DoD Instruction 6055.12 § 3.8(f), the decibel shifts indicated bilaterally between entry and separation are considered by DoD to indicate an early warning sign of permanent hearing loss. See id. at § 3.8(g).

After filing his supplemental claim for service connection, the Veteran underwent a VA examination. See August 2023 VA Examination Report. The examiner administered an audiogram that showed hearing loss for VA purposes in both ears and noted the Veteran's in-service hazardous noise exposure as well as his denial of any civilian noise exposure before or after service. See id. The examiner opined that there was no significant hearing threshold shift in either ear during service and therefore concluded that the current hearing loss disorder was less likely than not caused by service. See id. 

But the August 2023 VA examiner did not address or opine as to the favorable medical evidence showing that the decibel shifts at 2000 Hertz in the right ear and 4000 Hertz in the left ear at separation from service indicated "an early warning sign" of permanent hearing loss in each ear. The Board also notes that although the VA examiner erroneously cited a 20 decibel shift at 500 Herz in the right ear between entry and separation, she did not give an opinion that took into account the DoD regulation stating that such a shift generally indicates an early warning sign of permanent hearing loss. 

Further, the August 2023 VA examiner's rationale does not reflect consideration of the Veteran's competent and credible statement that during his active-duty service, he was sometimes exposed to excessive hazardous noise without hearing protection. The failure to consider the relevant favorable medical and lay evidence renders the VA examiner's opinion incomplete, and the Board finds that the opinion lacks probative value and is an inadequate basis upon which to decide the claim.

VA also obtained a medical opinion based on toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) for the hearing loss claim. See August 2023 VA Medical Opinion. The opining clinician rendered a negative nexus opinion based solely on the lack of in-service records showing a TERA, despite the conceded high probability of noise exposure due to the Veteran's MOS as machine gunner. See id. The Board observes that after the clinician rendered this medical opinion, a TERA memorandum was obtained in which the Veteran's MOS was cited as positive evidence of non-deployment related exposure consistent with the Veteran's service. See November 2023 TERA Memorandum. Thus, the Board finds the clinician's negative TERA opinion is an inadequate basis upon which to decide the claim.

In support of his supplemental claim, the Veteran submitted a private medical opinion. See December 2021 Private Medical Opinion (submitted September 2022). The private clinician opined, based on the Veteran's MOS and lay testimony, that his current hearing loss was at least as likely as not due to or related to his in-service noise exposure. See id. 

Although the private clinician did not discuss the hearing threshold shifts documented in the entry and separation audiograms when she rendered her opinion, see id., the Board assigns the private medical opinion some probative value as the private clinician has training, knowledge, and expertise on which she relied to render an opinion. See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. 295, 300-04 (2008). The Board observes that it is within the province of a qualified professional to determine the significance of evidence, which the private examiner did in this case.  

Additionally, as discussed above, the objective medical evidence of record demonstrates that at separation from service, there was a shift in the hearing threshold of both ears that indicated an early warning sign of permanent hearing loss bilaterally. Compare March 1992 STR with December 1995 STR. 

Based on the foregoing and resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss was incurred in service and thus, service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted on a direct basis. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.114; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Accordingly, the criterial for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met, and the appeal is granted.
