ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism (thyroid disability) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's thyroid disability is related to his military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

With reasonable doubt resolved in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for thyroid disability are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1987 to December 1987.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which readjudicated the claim of entitlement to service connection for thyroid condition and denied it on the merits.  The Board is bound by the favorable finding that new and relevant evidence was received.  38 U.S.C. § 5104(b)(4); 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).

In a September 2024 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182), the Veteran timely appealed the September 2024 rating decision to the Board and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the RO.  38?C.F.R. §?20.202.  As the Veteran has selected the Direct Review docket, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on the issue or issues on appeal.  38 U.S.C. § 7113(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board will not consider evidence added to the record after the date of the AOJ decision on appeal.  If evidence was added during this ineligible period, the Board did not consider it.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, he may at any time file a supplemental claim with the AOJ after receiving this decision and the additional evidence will be considered in connection with the supplemental claim.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5104C(a)(1)(B), (b); 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2501, 20.1105(a).  If filed within one year, this supplemental claim will preserve the date of the claim denied herein as the effective date of the grant of the benefit or benefits sought.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(2)(B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

As a final preliminary matter, in Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307 (2024) the Court held that "because [38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2)] gives a claimant the later of one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mails notice of the decision or 60 days from when the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to change the NOD and select a different lane, the Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up."  In this case, a year has not elapsed since the September 2024 rating decision on appeal.  As the Board is granting the benefits sought in full, however, it will not delay adjudication pursuant to Williams, as there is no prejudice to the Veteran in issuing this decision.

Thyroid disability 

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, air, or space service. 38?U.S.C. §?1110; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service incurrence of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  Consistent with this framework, service connection is warranted for a disease first diagnosed after service when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d).

In October 2023 the Veteran attended a VA examination.  The VA examiner diagnosed him with hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.  Thus, a current disability has been demonstrated.

The Veteran reported that he was exposed to radiation in service.  In an August 2023 VA Memorandum, the AOJ found that the Veteran was exposed to radiation while in service.  Therefore, the in-service injury or disease requirement is met.  

The remaining question is whether a nexus exists between the Veteran's current thyroid disability and his military service.  

An October 2023 VA examiner opined the Veteran's thyroid disability was at least as likely as not related to his exposure to radiation while in service.  In support of this opinion, he explained medical literature supports a causal relationship between radiation and thyroid disease.  Although the VA examiner's rationale was not extensive, reading the opinion as a whole and in the context of the evidence of record, it is entitled to some probative weight as she ultimately concluded that his disability is related to his service.  See Monzingo v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 97, 106 (2012) (the fact that the rationale provided by an examiner "did not explicitly lay out the examiner's journey from the facts to a conclusion," did not render the examination inadequate); Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 294 (2012) (medical reports must be read as a whole and in the context of the evidence of record).  Moreover, there is no contrary opinion of record.  The Board notes that VA conceded exposure to ionizing radiation in an August 2023 memorandum.

Given the positive nexus opinion, the evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's thyroid disability is related to his military service.  As the reasonable doubt created by this relative equipoise in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, entitlement to service connection for thyroid disability is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
