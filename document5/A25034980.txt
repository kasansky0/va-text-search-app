ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus, type II, (DM II) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran was not exposed to herbicide agents during his active service.

2. The Veteran was exposed to asbestos during his active service.

3. The Veteran's DM II was not incurred in service and is not due to asbestos exposure.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for DM II have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from August 1968 to August 1972.

This appeal stems from an October 2024 higher-level review decision. In the November 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for DM II is denied.

The Veteran asserts that he had DM II due to either asbestos exposure or herbicide agent exposure.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury, which is the "nexus" element. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Chronic diseases are presumed to be related to service if they are shown as chronic in service, or within an applicable presumptive period, unless they are clearly attributable to intercurrent causes; or, if they become manifest to a degree of 10% or more within an applicable presumptive period; or, if they are noted in service without sufficient evidence to establish that they are chronic in service, when there is continuity of symptomatology since service that is related to the chronic disease. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101(3), 1112(a)(1), 1113(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013). DM II is a chronic disease for the purpose of these presumptions.

Certain diseases, including DM II, are presumed to have been incurred in service for veterans who performed "covered service" even if there is no record of that disease during service. 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a). These veterans who performed "covered service" are presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents during that service unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to such an agent. Id. § 1116(c). The term "covered service" includes service preformed in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, and on Guam or American Samoa or within their territorial waters from January 9, 1962, to July 31, 1980. Id. § 1116(d).

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are negative for DM II.

The Veteran's service personnel records (SPRs) state that the Veteran was on the USS Hunley (AS-31) (Hunley) from March 15, 1969, to May 28, 1971. In March 1971, he requested a reassignment for humanitarian reasons to care for his mother. He reported to the Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, NJ, on June 29, 1971.

In a May 2018 letter, the Veteran stated that he was aboard the Hunley in 1971 when it docked at the port in Da Nang, Vietnam. He stated that he was there for two weeks, and afterward the Hunley sailed to Guam. He stated that he was in Guam until he was transferred to Lakehurst, NJ, in February 1972.

A December 2021 records research response states that a professional researcher reviewed primary sources and determined that the Hunley did not travel to the Republic of Vietnam or its territorial waters between March 15, 1969, to May 28, 1971.

 A July 2023 records research response states that the Hunley was not on Guam or in its territorial waters between March 15, 1969, to May 28, 1971.

In a September 2023 letter, the Veteran stated that he was aboard the Hunley from October 1971 to March 1972 when it was in Guam.

Private treatment records from January 2024 indicate that the Veteran was diagnosed with DM II in approximately 2012.

A March 2024 disability benefits questionnaire (DBQ) states that the Veteran has DM II that is treated with prescribed oral hypoglycemic agents.

An April 2024 memorandum states that the Veteran was exposed to asbestos during his active service.

An April 2024 medical opinion states that the Veteran has had DM II since approximately 2003. The examiner noted that while the exact cause of DM II is unknown, there are known risk factors for developing DM II such as being overweight, being physically inactive, family history, increased age, and belonging to certain ethnic groups. However, the examiner stated that there is no medical or scientific evidence available that provides any indication that there is a relationship between DM II and asbestos exposure. Therefore, the examiner reasoned that the Veteran's DM II is less likely than not related to the Veteran's asbestos exposure.

The AOJ favorably determined that the Veteran has a current DM II diagnosis and that he was exposed to asbestos during his active service. These findings are not clearly and unmistakably erroneous, and they bind the Board. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).

First, the Board finds that the evidence weighs heavily against a finding that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents during his active service. The Veteran does not claim that he was actually exposed to herbicide agents, but he does allege that he served in Guam and the Republic of Vietnam from late 1971 to early 1972. But the Veteran's SPRs demonstrate that he was aboard the Hunley from March 15, 1969, to May 28, 1971, and that he reported to the Lakehurst, NJ, Naval Air Station in June 1971. The Veteran's transfer records are supported by his enlisted performance record, which lists his location as Lakehurst, NJ, in entries dated from August 1971 to August 1972. The Veteran's SPRs are internally consistent, appear to be regular, and were contemporaneously prepared. Consequently, the Board finds that they are highly probative as to the dates on which the Veteran was aboard the Hunley. VA records researchers reviewed the relevant documents and determined that the Hunley was not in either the Republic of Vietnam or Guam from March 15, 1969, to May 28, 1971. There is no contrary evidence regarding those dates. Therefore, the Board finds that the most persuasive evidence demonstrates that the Veteran was not actually or presumptively exposed to herbicide agents during his active service.

The Board specifically acknowledges the Veteran's lay statements alleging that he was aboard the Hunley from late 1971 to early 1972 when it was docked in the Republic of Vietnam and Guam. The Veteran's statements are contrary to his SPRs, which indicate that he was in New Jersey during that time. The Veteran also submitted articles stating that the Hunley was in the Republic of Vietnam and Guam in late 1971 and early 1972. Those articles do not state that the Hunley was in either location from March 15, 1969, to May 28, 1971. The Board finds that the Veteran's statements were made many years after his discharge from active service, and consequently they have diminished probative value. Therefore, Board finds that the probative value of the Veteran's SPRs heavily outweighs the Veteran's lay statements. Bardwell v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 36, 40 (2010) ("a non-combat veteran's lay statements must be weighed against other evidence, including the absence of military records supporting the veteran's lay assertions"); see Gardin v. Shinseki, 613 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (the Board may discount lay evidence when it is not consistent with other evidence in the record).

Second, the Board finds that the most probative evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's DM II was not incurred in or the result of the Veteran's service. The Veteran's DM II was not "noted" in service, and it was first diagnosed many years after the Veteran's discharge. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). The April 2024 medical examiner opined that there is no medical or scientific evidence suggesting that DM II and asbestos have any relationship. The Board finds that this explanation is understandable and highly probative. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran alleges that his DM II is due to asbestos exposure. However, the Board finds that whether asbestosis causes DM II is a complicated scientific issue, and it finds that the Veteran is not competent to provide evidence on that issue. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (lay evidence is generally not competent to identify complex conditions). 

Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim of entitlement to service connection for DM II, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-782 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Therefore, the appeal is denied.
