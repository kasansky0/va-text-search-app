ORDER

New and relevant evidence having been received, the claim of entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss is to be readjudicated.

Entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss is granted.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right ear hearing loss is denied.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In an unappealed rating decision issued in June 2022, service connection for left ear hearing loss was denied. 

2.  The evidence associated with the claims file subsequent to the June 2022 rating decision tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue with respect to the claim of service connection for left ear hearing loss.   

3. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his left ear hearing loss is related to his active service. 

4. The Veteran's hearing loss has been manifested as hearing loss no greater than Level XI in the right ear during the period on appeal. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria to readjudicate the claim of entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss based on new and relevant evidence have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.2501. 

2. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385. 

3. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for right ear hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.86, DC 6100. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1972 to July 1973.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  The Veteran selected the direct review docket in his September 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD) to the Board; as such, evidence up until the date of the rating decision on appeal will be considered.  

The Board notes that the Veteran mentioned the issue of an earlier effective date for his total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) in his September 2024 NOD to the Board.  However, that claim was previously appealed to the Board in a November 2021 NOD and has been separately docketed; as such, it is not part of this appeal stream and will be addressed in a separate decision.

1. Whether new and relevant evidence has been received to readjudicate the claim of service connection for left ear hearing loss.  

A claimant may request readjudication of a previously denied claim, if new and relevant evidence is presented or secured.  38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d).  VA will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record.  New evidence means evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency decisionmakers.  The term "relevant evidence" means evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue.  The standard shall not be construed to impose a higher evidentiary threshold than the new and material evidence standard that was in effect prior to the date of the enactment of the AMA.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a).  

In this case, the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss was denied in a June 2022 rating decision.  Since then, the Veteran submitted a statement along with his June 2023 supplemental claim that provided more details about his hearing loss symptoms and how it has worsened.  The Board finds this evidence to be new and relevant, as it was not previously in the record and the statements regarding the Veteran's left ear hearing loss and tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue in this claim.   

Accordingly, the Board finds new and relevant evidence has been presented with respect to the Veteran's claim of service connection for left ear hearing loss.  Therefore, the Board may readjudicate the claim.  The claim is further addressed below.  

2. Entitlement to service connection for left ear hearing loss.  

Service connection will be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The evidence must show (1) the existence of a current disability, (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material issue, reasonable doubt will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1991).

The Veteran asserts that his currently diagnosed left ear hearing loss resulted from exposure to acoustic trauma while in service.

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, hearing loss will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz is 40 decibels or greater; the auditory thresholds for at least three of these frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

Normal hearing at separation is not fatal to a claim of service connection for hearing loss.  See Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992).  Evidence of a current hearing loss disability and a medically sound basis for attributing such disability to service may serve as a basis for a grant of service connection for hearing loss.  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993).

Regarding the first element of service connection, the results of the July 2023 VA audiological examination confirm that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of left ear hearing loss for VA purposes.  Thus, a current disability has been shown. 

Regarding exposure to hazardous noise, the Veteran has been service connected for right ear hearing loss and tinnitus based on findings in prior VA examinations that noted and conceded that the Veteran experienced noise injury in service.  Thus, in-service exposure to hazardous noise is conceded.

The Veteran has consistently maintained that he first noticed loss of hearing while in service and that he has experienced the same symptoms from that time to present.  Although service treatment records (STRs) do not show complaints or treatment of left ear hearing loss, the Board finds the positive nexus regarding the Veteran's tinnitus and right ear hearing loss are consistent with the facts of the Veteran's case regarding his left ear hearing loss and acoustic trauma in service.  

Accordingly, resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, service connection for a left ear hearing loss disability is granted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.303.

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for right ear hearing loss.  

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Individual disabilities are assigned separate DCs.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Any reasonable doubt regarding a degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  When the evidence is in relative equipoise, the veteran is accorded the benefit of the doubt.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).

In general, when an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  In addition, staged ratings are appropriate in any increased-rating claim in which distinct time periods with different ratable symptoms can be identified.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Evaluations for service-connected hearing loss range from noncompensable (0 percent) to 100 percent.  These evaluations are based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of a controlled speech discrimination test, the Maryland CNC test, together with the average hearing threshold level measured by puretone audiometry tests in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second (Hertz). 

Disability ratings for hearing loss are derived from a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations resulting from audiometric testing.  Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 349 (1992).  To evaluate the degree of disability from service-connected defective hearing, the rating schedule establishes eleven auditory hearing acuity levels designated from Level I, for essentially normal hearing acuity, through Level XI, for profound deafness.  Tables VI-VII, Diagnostic Code 6100.  Hearing acuity levels are assigned using just the puretone audiometry tests only where the examiner certifies that use of the speech discrimination test is not appropriate due to language difficulties or inconsistent speech discrimination test scores, for instance, or where exceptional patterns of hearing impairment exist.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.85(c), 4.86.

An exceptional pattern of hearing impairment occurs when the puretone threshold at each of the four specified frequencies (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz) is 55 decibels or more, or where the puretone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86 (a)-(b).  In these circumstances, the hearing acuity level will be assigned using either Table VI or Table VIa, whichever yields the higher level.  Id.

Here, a VA audiological examination was conducted in July 2023, pursuant to the Veteran's June 2023 supplemental claim.  The examination resulted in the following puretone thresholds in the right ear, in decibels: 

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	105+	105+	105+	105+	105+

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 0 percent in the right ear.  The average puretone thresholds in the range of 1000 to 4000 Hertz was 105 decibels in the right ear.  An exceptional pattern of hearing was found in the right ear.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86(a).  Applying these results to Table VIa yields a finding of Level XI hearing loss in the right ear.  As the Veteran is only service connected for hearing loss in his right ear during the appeal period, for purposes of determining a rating under Table VII, the Veteran's non service-connected left ear is assigned Level I hearing.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85(f).  Under Table VII, this results in a 10 percent evaluation.  

The Board notes that the Veteran has been service connected for his left ear hearing loss by virtue of this decision; however, applying the results of his left ear hearing loss test from the July 2023 VA examination also results in Level I hearing as his average puretone threshold was 26 decibels with speech recognition of 96 percent in the left ear.  Consideration of both ears would also result in a 10 percent evaluation.  As such, the Veteran being granted service connection for his left ear would not change the outcome of this decision.   

The Board further notes that the Veteran is competent to report the symptoms of his hearing disability and acknowledges he believes his hearing has worsened in his right ear.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  However, ratings for hearing loss are determined by a mechanical application of the VA rating schedule to the numeric designations assigned based on audiometric test results.  Lendenmann, 3 Vet. App. 345.  The Veteran's statements and evidence submitted do not show that he meets the specific puretone thresholds and/or speech discrimination percentages required for a higher rating.  His reported functional effects, including those noted during the VA examination, are consistent with the degree of hearing loss shown upon examination, and corresponding to the assigned disability evaluation.  Martinak v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 447 (2007).  The Board thus finds that the schedular criteria fully contemplate this disability, and this case raises no additional issues, such as a referral for extraschedular evaluation under 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b)(1). 

In summary, following a careful review of the evidence of record, the Board finds the evidence is not in approximate balance, and that the evidence persuasively favors a finding that the criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for right ear hearing loss have not been met at any point during the appeal period.  The VA audiological examination conducted during the appeal period does not entitle the Veteran to a higher rating.  In addition, there are no VA or adequate private treatment records appropriate for rating purposes that indicate a higher rating is warranted at any point during the appeal period.  As the criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent are not met, the claim is denied.
