DATE: April 16, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus is related to military noise exposure.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2007 to September 2015. 

The Veteran filed an original disability claim in August 2024, which was denied by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in October 2024. 

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred or aggravated during active military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1101; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). In general, service connection requires: (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) medical, or in certain circumstances, lay evidence of an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). 

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

For certain chronic disorders, to include tinnitus, service connection may be granted if the disease becomes manifest to a compensable degree within one year following separation from service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. In such cases, the disease is presumed under the law to have had its onset in service even if there is no evidence of such disease during service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a); see Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Alternatively, when a disease at 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a) is not shown to be chronic during service or the one-year presumptive period, service connection may also be established by a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). 

Where there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 780-81 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

The Veteran seeks service connection for tinnitus, which he contends was incurred in or caused by service due to military noise exposure. Specifically, the Veteran contends that while serving on board the USS Carl Vinson from June 2010 to August 2014 he was exposed to loud operating machinery and jet flight operations. See August 2024 VA 21-526EZ. 

The Board finds it important to note here that the Veteran received both; Hostile Fire/Imminent Danger Pay and the Combat Zone Tax Exclusion from February 2011 to May 2011 and from January 2012 to April 2012. See February 2011 Identification Materials.

Initially, the Board notes that the Veteran is competent to describe the nature and extent of his in-service noise exposure. See C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2); Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994). 

In September 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination where his records were reviewed, including his VA electronic health record and VA e-folder. The examiner noted that the Veteran served in the Gulf War Era, with a Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) of an Information Systems Technician (T3), which primarily worked as a Transmission System Technician and had a high probability for hazardous noise exposure. Additionally, the Veteran reported that his tinnitus began in service, and since, has occurred in both ears, 1-2 times per week, lasting for one minute to one minute and a half. See September 2024 C&P Exam. 

As such, exposure to acoustic trauma during service is conceded based on the Veteran's lay statements as to his military noise exposure. Moreover, the Board notes that tinnitus is a type of disability that may be established on the basis of lay evidence alone. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002). Therefore, there is no dispute that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus.

As such, the question remaining before the Board is whether the Veteran's tinnitus is etiologically related to his in-service noise exposure. Based on a careful review the evidence, and resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that service connection for tinnitus is warranted.

The Board notes that the AOJ obtained a VA examination and medical opinion in September 2024. However, the examiner opined that the Veteran's tinnitus is less likely than not caused by noise exposure during military service. The examiner stated only that the Veteran did not meet the medical definition of tinnitus. 

In October 2024, the AOJ requested an addendum medical opinion from the September 2024 examiner, to clarify whether the Veteran had a diagnosis of tinnitus. The examiner provided the same rationale, that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of tinnitus, therefore, nexus to service could not be established. 

A medical opinion based on inaccurate factual premise may properly be rejected as non-probative. See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 460 (1993). As noted, prior, tinnitus is a type of disability that may be established on the basis of lay evidence alone. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002). The examiner relying on the inaccurate factual premise, that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of tinnitus, renders the September and October 2024 medical opinions, non-probative. The Board therefore finds the September and October 2024 medical opinions to be inadequate.

In light of the above, the Board notes that the record does not contain an adequate medical opinion with regard to the etiology of the Veteran's tinnitus. Nonetheless, the Board finds there is sufficient evidence in the record to decide the claim. In the absence of an adequate medical opinion to the contrary, the Board accepts the Veteran's lay statement that his symptoms of tinnitus had their initial onset during service and have continued ever since. See Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that a Veteran's statement is competent evidence as to events that are capable of lay observation). In this regard, the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and to provide a history of when these symptoms began and whether the symptoms have been intermittent, continuous, or progressive in nature or severity. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 469-70. The Board finds these statements to be credible and consistent with the circumstances of the Veteran's service and are uncontroverted by any other evidence of record. See Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 469-70.

Based on the Veteran's competent and credible statement regarding the onset and continuity of his tinnitus symptoms, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in approximate balance that the Veteran's current tinnitus is related to his military noise exposure. Accordingly, resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the claim for service connection for tinnitus is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 780-81.
