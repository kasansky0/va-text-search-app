ORDER

New and relevant evidence has been presented to readjudicate the claim of service connection for urethral stricture disability.

Service connection for urethral stricture disability is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. New evidence was received after the September 2014 rating decision that is relevant to the issue of entitlement to service connection for urethral stricture disability.

2. The Veteran's urethral stricture disability resulted from service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria to readjudicate the claim of service connection for urethral stricture disability are met. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156, 3.2501.

2. The criteria for service connection for urethral stricture have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from October 1975 to February 1980. The Board recognizes the Veteran's service to his country and the sacrifices it entailed. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2019 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denying service connection for urethral stricture disability because the evidence submitted was not new and relevant.

In the October 2019 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on August 30, 2023.

Therefore, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the June 2019 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran at the hearing or during the evidence submission window thereafter.  The hearing transcript has been associated with the claims file.

It is important to note this was an advanced on docket appeal, and the Veteran waived the majority of the 90 day submission period.  Due to an administrative hold, however, this case has been in stasis for more than a year awaiting resolution of an issue that ultimately had no bearing on the Board's decision, and for that, the Board extends its sincere apologies to the Veteran.

New and relevant evidence

A supplemental claim will be readjudicated if new and relevant evidence is presented. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d). "New" evidence is evidence not previously submitted to agency decisionmakers. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1). "Relevant" evidence is evidence that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue. Id.

In a September 2014 rating decision, the Veteran was denied service connection for urethral stricture disability because the evidence showed no nexus between the claimed disability and service. VA did not receive a timely appeal or new and relevant evidence prior to expiration of the appeal period. Therefore, the September 2014 rating decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

In March 2019, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim to readjudicate the claim of service connection for urethral stricture disability.

A June 2019 rating decision denied service connection for urethral stricture disability because new and relevant evidence had not been received to show a link between this disability and active duty.

For the reasons stated below, the Board finds new and relevant evidence has been presented to readjudicate the claim of service connection for urethral stricture disability.

Attached to the March 2019 Supplemental claim, the Veteran submitted a medical opinion from a treating provider indicating that his urethral stricture disability was related to urinary tract infections the Veteran received treatment for while in service. See March 2019 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.

This evidence is new. It was not of record at the time of the September 2014 rating decision and was obtained during a time when additional evidence may be considered. This evidence is also relevant because it tends to prove whether the Veteran's disability is related to active duty. In light of the above, readjudication of this claim is warranted.

1. Service connection for urethral stricture disability is granted.

The Veteran contends his urethral stricture disability is related to service. See August 2011 VA Form 21-4138; Hearing Transcript.

Service connection may be granted for a current disability that began during active duty, but was not diagnosed until later. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection generally requires competent evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and in-service injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The first element of service connection, a current disability, is met. In the June 2019 rating decision, the AOJ conceded the Veteran has a current disability. 

The second element of service connection is also met. The Veteran's service treatment records from October 1978 show treatment for a urinary tract infection. See Service Treatment Records. 

The Board further finds the Veteran's current disability of urethral stricture disability is causally related to service. 

In March 2019 the Veteran submitted a private medical opinion from his urologist. The provider noted he has treated the Veteran for urethral stricture since December 2015. The examiner noted that the Veteran has no other risk factors that may have precipitated his condition. The examiner further explained that in his personal experience and based on medical literature, it is known that urethral infections can result in scarring of the urethral and the development of urethral stricture. The examiner concluded that after review of the pertinent records, it is highly likely that the Veteran's condition is a direct result of his urethral infection from service. See March 2019 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.

The Board finds this opinion is highly probative because it is based on a review of the record and contains clear conclusions with supporting data connected by a reasoned medical explanation. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301-02 (2008)

In conclusion, there is a competent medical opinion in favor of finding a causal connection between in-service injury and present disability, and none against it. The Board therefore finds all three elements are met, and service connection is warranted for urethral stricture disability. This appeal is granted.
