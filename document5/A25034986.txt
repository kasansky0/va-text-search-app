DOCKET NO. 221109-293496
DATE: April 16, 2025

REMANDED

The claim for a total disability rating for compensation based on individual unemployability (TDIU) prior to August 9, 2023, is remanded.   

FINDING OF FACT

As the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) has completed a decision addressing the claim for a rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus type II on appeal to the Board from a May 2024 notice of disagreement, the claim for a rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus type II previously on appeal from a March 2020 notice of disagreement must be dismissed.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of a claim for a rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus type II previously on appeal to the Board from a March 2020 notice of disagreement are met.  38 U.S.C. 7104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1965 to December 1968.  

This case was originally before the Board on appeal from a March 2020 rating decision which denied a higher rating for the Veteran's diabetes mellitus, type II. The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 (notice of disagreement) in March 2020, electing to appeal under the Evidence docket.  The Board denied the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes in a March 2023 decision.  The Veteran appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In an August 2024 Memorandum Decision with Judgment entered in September 2024, the Court vacated the March 2023 Board decision and, after finding a December 2021 VA examination to assess the severity of the Veteran's diabetes relied upon in the March 2023 Board decision to be inadequate, remanded the claim for diabetes for another VA diabetes examination.  

During the course of this laim, the Veteran was provided with a VA examination for his diabetes that was completed in May 2024.  Thereafter, a May 2024 rating decision denied a rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes.  The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 later in May 2024 with respect to this denial and the Board completed a remand of the claim for an increased rating for diabetes in April 2025.  As such, the proper course of action for the Board with respect to the claim for a rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus type II previously before the Board on appeal from the March 2020 notice of disagreement is to dismiss such claim.  See 38 U.S.C. 7104 (with respect to the jurisdiction of the Board generally.) 

REASONS FOR REMAND

With respect to TDIU, while entitlement to this benefit was granted by a November 2024 rating decision effective from August 9, 2023, and the Veteran filed a notice of disagreement with respect to the effective date for this grant in March 2025, the  undersigned finds that the matter of entitlement to TDIU is a component of the claim for a rating in excess of 20 percent for diabetes mellitus currently on appeal, particularly in light of the reports from the May 2023 VA examination discussing the impact of the Veteran's diabetes on his ability to work.  As such, this matter will be remanded for additional consideration by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction to ensure due process to the Veteran. 

For the reasons set forth above, this case is REMANDED for the following action:

Adjudicate the matter of entitlement to TDIU prior to August 9, 2023.
