ORDER

New and relevant evidence having been received, readjudication of the previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. New evidence was received after the July 2021 rating decision that is relevant to the issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

2. Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is related to service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for readjudication of the claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(d).

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from May 1970 until his honorable discharge in January 1972.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2022 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.  In the September 29, 2022, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  A Board hearing was held on January 7, 2025.

In November 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the service connection claim for bilateral hearing loss most recently addressed in a July 2021 rating decision.  In February 2021, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had not been received.  Therefore, the Board must determine whether new and relevant evidence has been received based only on the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. §?20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 20.902(c).

1. New and relevant evidence having been received, readjudication of the previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted

The Veteran's claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss was initially denied in a July 2021 rating decision.  In November 2021, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim, requesting readjudication of the July 2021 rating decision.  Thereafter, in February 2022, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had not been received to warrant readjudication of the claim, and the Veteran appealed that decision to the Board.

If new and relevant evidence is presented or secured with respect to a supplemental claim, the AOJ will readjudicate the claim taking into consideration all of the evidence of record.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(1).  Relevant evidence is information that tends to prove or disprove a matter at issue in a claim, including evidence that raises a theory of entitlement that was not previously addressed.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(a)(2).  If new and relevant evidence is not presented or secured, the AOJ will issue a decision finding that there was insufficient evidence to readjudicate the claim.  Id. 

Relevant evidence received since the July 2021 rating decision consist of the Veteran's January 2025 Board hearing testimony, private treatment records, including an opinion linking his hearing loss to service, and a September 2022 statement from the Veteran's spouse.  The Board finds that new and relevant evidence has been received.  The evidence is new because the evidence was not considered at the time of the prior final rating decision.  The evidence is also relevant, as it tends to prove or disprove a matter in issue.  The matter at issue here is the establishment of a nexus between the Veteran's claimed bilateral hearing loss and service.  The Veteran's aforementioned evidence provides more information regarding in-service injury or event and its relation to the development of his current condition.

2. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted.

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral hearing loss, which he asserts was caused by in-service noise exposure.  During his January 2025 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that his hearing loss is a result of noise exposure from being in close proximity to tanks while on the firing range.  The Veteran further testified that he experienced hearing loss immediately following the event, and that it has deteriorated over time.

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Generally, to prove service connection there must be: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Moreover, where a veteran has served continuously for 90 days or more during a period of war, or during peacetime service after December 31, 1946, and sensorineural hearing loss becomes manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from the date of termination of such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  This presumption is rebuttable by affirmative evidence to the contrary.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

Where the Veteran asserts entitlement to a chronic disease but there is insufficient evidence of a diagnosis in service, service connection may be established under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) by demonstrating a continuity of symptomatology since service, but an award solely on this basis is only permissible if the chronic disease is listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Service connection for hearing loss may be granted where there is credible evidence of acoustic trauma due to significant noise exposure in service, post-service audiometric findings meeting the regulatory requirements for hearing loss for VA purposes, and a medically sound basis upon which to attribute the post-service findings to the injury in service (as opposed to intercurrent causes).  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159 (1993).

For the purposes of applying the law administered by VA, impaired hearing is considered a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz (specified frequencies) is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  "[W]hen audiometric test results at a veteran's separation from service do not meet the regulatory requirements for establishing a 'disability' at that time, he or she may nevertheless establish service connection for a current hearing disability by submitting evidence that the current disability is causally related to service."  Hensley, 5 Vet. App. at 160.

As an initial matter the Board finds that the Veteran has a current hearing loss disability pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, as shown by an April 2021 VA examination.  Moreover, the Veteran's exposure to hazardous noise during service has been conceded.  Thus, the question becomes whether the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is related to service.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in April 2021, at which time the examiner explained that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's hearing loss is due to military noise exposure because there was no threshold shift or hearing loss recorded during the Veteran's military service.  In November 2021, a VA examiner acknowledged the Veteran's history of in-service noise exposure; however, she opined that it is less likely than not that his current hearing loss is related to service as the lack of positive threshold shifts during service is objective evidence of no permanent auditory damage on active duty.

As explained above, it is well established that service connection for a hearing loss disability is not precluded where hearing was within normal limits on audiometric testing at separation from service.  The Board acknowledges the negative opinions provided by the April 2021 and November 2021 VA examiners.  However, to the extent the examiners based their opinion on the Veteran having normal hearing upon separation from service, the Board finds it inadequate and gives it no probative weight.  Moreover, in October 2021, the Veteran's private audiologist opined that his bilateral hearing loss is more likely than not related to his time in service.  Additionally, in a September 2022 statement, the Veteran wife reported that the Veteran's hearing was significantly decreased when he was discharged from service.

In light of the above, the Board finds that the competent and probative evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is related to his military service.  Accordingly, resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, service connection for left ear hearing loss is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
