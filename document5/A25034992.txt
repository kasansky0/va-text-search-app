ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

The weight of the persuasive evidence is against finding that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disability began during his active service or is otherwise related to his active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Army from July 1993 to January 1996, with additional service in the Army Reserve. The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) thanks the Veteran for his service to our country.

This matter is before the Board on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

However, because the Board is remanding the claim for service connection for hypertension, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

A claim for service connection may encompass claims for any disability that may reasonably be encompassed by several factors, including the claimant's description of the claim, the symptoms the claimant describes, and the information the claimant submits or that the Secretary of VA obtain in support of the claim. Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009). Accordingly, the Board has taken an expansive view of the Veteran's psychiatric claim pursuant to Clemons, and recharacterized the issue as shown on the title page of this decision.

The March 2024 VA Form 10182 purports to appeal entitlement to service connection for alcohol abuse. This issue was adjudicated in a January 2024 rating decision. In February 2024, the Veteran submitted VA Form 10182, requesting review of entitlement to service connection for alcohol abuse. Entitlement to service connection for alcohol abuse was adjudicated in the April 8, 2025 Board decision. Thus, the issue is not currently on appeal.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Generally, to prevail on the issue of service connection the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In a service connection claim, VA must provide a medical examination where there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the appellant's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the VA to make a decision on the claim. McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

When there is an approximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability.

The Veteran asserts his acquired psychiatric disability is related to service. In his February 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ, he claimed that his depression is related to service. Otherwise, he has not offered any lay statements in support of his claim explaining why he believes his claimed acquired psychiatric disability is related to service.

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are silent for any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of an acquired psychiatric disability. There is no separation examination in the file.

The first mention of a psychiatric disability in the post-service treatment records is in a July 2019 Cincinnati VAMC treatment note. The examining physician noted the Veteran's mental health diagnoses included alcohol use disorder, severe, and tobacco use disorder. In a September 2019 treatment note, the Veteran reported a history of insomnia. The examining physician diagnosed unspecified insomnia, alcohol use disorder, and tobacco use disorder.

After a review of the lay and medical evidence of record, the Board finds that the weight of the persuasive evidence is against finding that a medical nexus exists between the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disability and an in-service injury, event or disease. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. There is no medical opinion of record which weighs in favor of the claim. Records associated with the claims file do not show any nexus between an acquired psychiatric disability and active duty service.

The Veteran has not been provided with a VA examination or medical opinion; however, the Board finds that VA's duty to assist in such regard is not triggered. McLendon, 20 Vet. App. 79. In this regard, there is no evidence of an event, injury, or disease in service and no indication, beyond the Veteran's conclusory statements, that his acquired psychiatric disability is related to his active military service. Waters, 601 F.3d at 1278.

The Board has also considered the Veteran's lay opinion that his claimed acquired psychiatric disability is related to service. In this case, the Board considers the potential relationship between the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disability and its connection to service to be complex in nature. Woehlaert, 21 Vet. App. at 462. Therefore, while the Veteran is competent to describe his symptoms, he does not have the medical expertise that would render him competent to provide a nexus opinion.

In this case, the most probative evidence of record does not show that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disability is related to service.

As the weight of the persuasive evidence is against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application to the instant appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776. For these reasons, the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability is denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Although further delay is regrettable, the issue of entitlement to service connection for hypertension is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the February 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3.159, 20.802.

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension.

The Veteran asserts his hypertension is related to service.

For VA compensation purposes, hypertension is defined as diastolic blood pressure predominately 90mm or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure is predominately 160mm or greater, with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90mm. Hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on at least three different days. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101, Note (1).

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) reveal that he was not diagnosed with hypertension during his active service. However, STRs show that he had elevated blood pressure readings.

In an undated record, the Veteran's BP was recorded as 110/70. See STR - Medical, page 45. In an undated record, the Veteran's standing BP was recorded as 110/88, his sitting BP was recorded as 118/90, and his laying BP was recorded as 120/100. See STR - Medical, page 51. In an undated record, the Veteran's BP was recorded as 110/78. See STR - Medical, page 52. In December 1993 his BP was recorded as 125/70. In May 1995 his BP was recorded as 130/72. See STR - Dental. There is no separation examination in the file.

The Veteran's post-service VA treatment records note a diagnosis of hypertension.

VA has a duty to assist, which includes providing a medical examination, when necessary to decide a claim. The Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination for his hypertension, and the Board finds that such is warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); McLendon, 20 Vet. App. 79. The record reflects a current disability, evidence of an in-service incident, and an indication that the current hypertension may be related to service. The AOJ's failure to obtain an examination is a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) should schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of his hypertension.

The examiner must note in the examination report that the claims file has been reviewed. Following a review of the entire record, the examiner is asked to address the following:

(a)	Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's hypertension had its onset in service or is otherwise related to his active service.

(b)	Whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's hypertension manifested within one year of his separation from service (January 1996).

In rendering the requested opinions, the examiner's attention is directed to the following:

"	Relevant service treatment records. (In an undated record, the Veteran's BP was recorded as 110/70. In an undated record, his standing BP was recorded as 110/88, his sitting BP was recorded as 118/90, and his laying BP was recorded as 120/100. In an undated record, his BP was recorded as 110/78. See STR - Medical. In December 1993 his BP was recorded as 125/70. In May 1995 his BP was recorded as 130/72. See STR - Dental.)

The Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and history. Such reports must be acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinion.

A complete rationale for all opinions must be provided. Merely stating that the service treatment records and post-service medical treatment records do not show a diagnosis in service or shortly after separation is not sufficient.
