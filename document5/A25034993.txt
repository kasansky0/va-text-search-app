REMANDED

The appeal regarding entitlement to compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for upper body swelling is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from February 1972 to January 1975.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a November 2023 rating decision by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) that included denial of compensation under 38 U.S.C. § 1151 for upper body swelling.  

The Veteran requested higher level review in December 2023, and the AOJ issued a responsive rating decision in April 2024.  The Veteran submitted VA Form 10182 in April 2024, electing the direct Board review option.  The Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 rating decision.

The Veteran asserts that he has upper body swelling that is related to prostatectomy performed by VA in 2012.  See May 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1151, compensation is awarded for a qualifying additional disability in the same manner as if such additional disability was service connected.  A qualifying additional disability is one which is (1) not the result of the veteran's willful misconduct, (2) caused by hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination furnished the veteran under the law administered by VA, and (3) the proximate cause of the disability was (A) carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on the part of VA in furnishing the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination, or (B) an event not reasonably foreseeable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1151; 38 C.F.R. § 3.361.  Whether an event is reasonably foreseeable is based on what a reasonable health care provider would have foreseen.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.361(d)(2); Schertz v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 362, 368-69 (2013).

To determine whether a Veteran has an additional disability, VA compares the Veteran's condition immediately before the beginning of the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, examination, training and rehabilitation services, or compensated work therapy (CWT) program upon which the claim is based to the Veteran's condition after such care, treatment, examination services, or program has stopped.  38 C.F.R. § 3.361(b).

The record reflects that the Veteran underwent radical prostatectomy at a VA facility in July 2012.  The Veteran asserts that he experiences swelling of his upper body that began following this surgery and is related to it.  See November 2018 VA urology note.  VA problem lists indicate edema, but are unclear as to its nature.

The Veteran has not been afforded an examination to address whether his edema is related to his 2012 prostatectomy.  The Board concludes that an examination is necessary to make a determination in this appeal.  Thus, remand is required to obtain an examination and correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule an examination to determine whether the Veteran sustained additional disability as the result of VA surgical treatment in July 2012.

The evidentiary record, including a copy of this remand, must be made available to and reviewed by the examiner.

Following examination of the Veteran and review of the record, the examiner should address the following:

(a).  Whether the Veteran suffered additional disability consisting of edema/swelling of the upper body as a result of VA surgical treatment in July 2012.  

If so, each additional disability should be clearly identified.

(b).  For each additional disability identified, is it at least as likely as not that such is the result of, or caused by, carelessness, negligence, lack of proper skill, error in judgment, or similar instance of fault on the part of VA in furnishing the hospital care, medical or surgical treatment, or examination?

(c).  Did VA fail to exercise the degree of care that would be expected of a reasonable health care provider?

The examiner is to consider VA treatment records reflecting radical prostatectomy in July 2012 and subsequent findings of edema.  

(d.)  Was the additional disability due to an event that was not reasonably foreseeable?

The examiner is advised that the event need not be completely unforeseeable or unimaginable, but must be one that a reasonable provider would not have considered to be an ordinary risk of the treatment provided.

In rendering these opinions, the examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and history.  Such reports must be acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinion.

The complete rationale for all opinions should be set forth, including a discussion of the facts and medical principles involved.
