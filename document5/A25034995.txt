ORDER

The appeal for earlier effective date and initial increased evaluation for the award of service connection for left knee patellofemoral pain syndrome at 10 percent, left knee instability at 10 percent, right knee patellofemoral pain syndrome at 10 percent, and right knee instability at 20 percent, prior to April 20, 2015, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On December 19, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran, via his authorized representative at the time, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. In the present case, the Veteran, through his authorized representative at the time, has withdrawn this appeal via written request in December 2024 and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
