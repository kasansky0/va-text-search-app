ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of June 28, 2007, for the grant of service connection for residuals of tonsillectomy is granted.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of June 28, 2007, for the grant of service connection for residuals of resection of benign vocal cord lesions is granted.

REMANDED

A rating higher than 10 percent for residuals of tonsillectomy is remanded.

A compensable rating for residuals of resection of benign vocal cord lesions is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The Veteran filed his initial claim for service connection for residuals of tonsillectomy and resection of benign vocal cord lesions in March 2008, within one year of separation from service.

2.  A July 2008 rating decision denied service connection for residuals of tonsillectomy and resection of benign vocal cord lesions.

3.  Service department records from the Veteran's final period of service from June 2002 to June 2007 were in existence at the time of the 2008 rating decision, which were not associated with the claims file until September 2023; finality does not attach to the 2008 rating decision, and reconsideration is warranted.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1.  The criteria for an earlier effective date of June 28, 2007, for the grant of service connection for residuals of tonsillectomy are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156.

2.  The criteria for an earlier effective date of June 28, 2007, for the grant of service connection for residuals of resection of benign vocal cord lesions are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.156.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1996 to June 1998, July 1998 to July 2000, and June 2002 to June 2007.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024. In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1.  An effective date earlier than January 13, 2023, for the grant of service connection for residuals of tonsillectomy

2. An effective date earlier than January 13, 2023, for the grant of service connection for residuals of resection of benign vocal cord lesions 

The Veteran, through his attorney, asserts that an effective date of June 28, 2007, the first day after separation from service is warranted. See Third Party Correspondence (July 2024). He argues this is true because relevant service treatment records (STRs) were associated with the claims file after the initial denial of service connection. Id.

The Board finds the weight of the evidence demonstrates that relevant service department records were submitted after a final denial in a 2013 rating decision and a June 28, 2007, effective date, is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(c), 3.400.

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim for service connection or a claim reopened after final adjudication "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor." 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). The implementing regulation clarifies this to mean that the effective date of an evaluation and an award of compensation based on an original claim or a claim reopened after final disallowance "will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later." 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

With a claim for service connection, the effective date of an award will be (1) the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service or (2) the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

If, at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant service department records that existed and had not been associated with the file at the time of the prior decision, VA will reconsider the claim de novo. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1). "Relevant" means service records that speak to a matter in issue or in dispute. Kisor v. Wilkie, 969 F.3d 1333, 1341-43 (Fed. Cir. 2020). In other words, to be relevant the new service department records must pertain to the basis of the prior final denial. Id.

Here, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for benign vocal cord lesions in March 2008. See VA 21-526 Veterans Application for Compensation or Pension (March 2008). In July 2008, the AOJ denied service connection for residual tonsillitis and residuals of vocal cord lesions, noting that there was no evidence that a tonsillectomy was performed during military service, evidence of current tonsillectomy residuals or treatment for benign vocal cord lesions in service. See Rating Decision (July 2008). Of record at that time were STRs that noted treatment for tonsillitis in February 2002 and September 2003 and treatment for pharyngitis in September 2000 with treatment in February 2002 and again on two occasions in 2003. 

On September 26, 2023, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim requesting readjudication of the claims denied in the July 2008 rating decision. See VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application (September 2023). Concurrently, the Veteran submitted additional service treatment records (STRs) that had not been previously obtained or associated with the claims file. These STRs contained additional information regarding the Veteran's tonsillectomy and resection of benign vocal cord lesions. See Medical Treatment Record Government Facility (September 2023). Thereafter, the AOJ granted service connection and assigned an effective date of January 13, 2023. See Rating Decision (March 2024). 

The Board finds that the service treatment record associated with the record in 2023 were relevant as it pertains to the in-service element of the Veteran's service connection claims, which was the basis of the prior 2008 denial. Moreover, such records had existed, but had not been associated with the file at the time of the prior denial. Therefore, the Board will reconsider the Veteran's March 2008 claim of entitlement to service connection. 

Finding that the presence of new, relevant service department records were added to the record, for an earlier effective date to be warranted based on the receipt of such records the award of benefits must be at least in part based on such records. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c)(3); see Jones v. Wilkie, 964 F.3d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2020).

Here, the evidence of record shows that the Veteran's claimed disabilities began in service and existed prior to his original VA disability claim dated March 7, 2008, which was within one year after separation from service. Additionally, the RO's March 2024 rating decision reviewed the record, including the missing service-treatment records associated with the claims file in September 2023, and granted service connection based on a VA medical opinion that issued a positive nexus opinion based in part on the newly submitted service treatment records. After review of the record, the Board finds that the award of service connection was based at least "in part" on the newly provided, but previously existing service treatment records. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c)(3).

Therefore, the appropriate effective date for award of service connection for is June 28, 2007. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

REASONS FOR REMAND

In remanding these matters, the Board makes no finding, implicit or otherwise, as to the credibility of the Veteran's assertions.  Neither the Veteran's credibility nor any lack thereof should be presumed in this remand.  Indeed, the Board expressly defers a credibility determination in this appeal until the development has been completed to the extent feasible.

1.  A rating higher than 10 percent for residuals of tonsillectomy

The Veteran seeks a higher rating for residuals of tonsillectomy. His attorney notes that the January 2024 VA examination "appears to support a 60% rating under DC 6519 for complete aphonia" and noted worsening of the disability and history of benign neoplasm and polyp of the vocal cord. See Third Party Correspondence (July 2024).

To ensure that VA has met its duty to assist, the appeal is remanded to correct an error that occurred prior to the March 2024 decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. The January 2024 VA examination is inadequate for adjudicative purposes because it is contradicted by other facts in the record as well as internal findings. Specifically, the January 2024 VA examination report reflects the Veteran has both complete organic aphonia with constant inability to speak above a whisper and incomplete organic aphonia with constant hoarseness. See C&P Exam February 2024. The Veteran reported a sore throat if he speaks for a long period of time, losing his voice often, and being unable to speak loudly. Id at 2. The examination report reflected that the Veteran "may likely continue to demonstrate symptoms of vocal cord paralysis such as: hoarseness, loss of vocal pitch, inability to speak loudly, constant throat clearing" which would have significant impact on his quality of life. Id at 10. In a September 2023 statement, he indicated that he had limited vocal range, limited ability to speak in a low voice, and intermittent loss of voice when attempting to speak softly. See VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim (September 2023). None of the statements made by the Veteran or noted on examination support a finding that complete organic aphonia with constant inability to speak above a whisper is a symptom of the Veteran's residuals of tonsillectomy. 

It is noted that a medical opinion must support the conclusions reached with an analysis that is adequate for the Board to consider and weigh against other evidence of record. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 102, 124-25. Also, "[a] medical examination report must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two." Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).

When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that it is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). As the obtained VA medical examination is not adequate, remand is required.

2.  A compensable rating for residuals of resection of benign vocal cord lesions

The Veteran seek a higher rating for service-connected residuals of resection of benign vocal cord lesions. His attorney argues that a 30 percent rating is warranted based on "decreased range of voice, which was weak and hoarse" and "relative thickening of the left vocal cord relative to the right." See Third Party Correspondence (July 2024).

The Board finds that remand is warranted for correction of an AOJ error in satisfying a statutory duty and for the AOJ to readjudicate this claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 ("[t]he Board may remand for correction of any other error by the [AOJ] in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty"); see also 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a) ("All questions in a matter, which under section 511(a) of this title is subject to decision by the Secretary, shall be subject to one review on appeal to the Secretary").

First, the Board finds that a correction of the diagnostic code for residuals of resection of benign vocal cord lesions is required.  The disability is currently rated under Diagnostic Code 6820 for benign neoplasms of any specified part of the respiratory system. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97. Under Diagnostic Code 6820, the AOJ is instructed to evaluate using an appropriate respiratory analogy. Id. Remand is required for the AOJ to identify the appropriate diagnostic code under which to rate residuals of resection of benign vocal cord lesions.

Second, the claims for increased ratings for residuals of tonsillectomy and residuals of benign vocal cord lesions have been intertwined in both the lay and medical evidence with hoarseness and loss of voice being the primary symptom reported for both disabilities. As both disabilities result from the same set of circumstances and manifest with the same or substantially similar symptoms, an initial determination as to whether separate compensable ratings is available for the claimed disabilities is required,

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1.  Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the current severity of the service-connected residuals of tonsillectomy and residuals of resection of benign vocal cord lesions.  The examiner should provide a full description of the disabilities and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disabilities under the rating criteria.

(a.)  The examiner must identify which, if any, symptoms can be attributed only to residuals of tonsillectomy or residuals of resection of benign vocal cord lesions, respectively.

(b.)  If symptoms of residuals of tonsillectomy and residuals of resection of benign vocal cord lesions cannot be separated, so state.

2.  Identify the appropriate respiratory analogy for residuals of resection of benign vocal cord lesions.
