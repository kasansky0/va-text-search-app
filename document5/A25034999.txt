ORDER

Entitlement to accrued benefits is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran died in October 1986, and there were no pending claims before the Board of Veterans Affairs (VA) and no periodic monthly benefits to which the Veteran was entitled at the time of his death under an existing rating or decision, or those based on evidence in the file at the date of death, and which were due and unpaid at the time of death.  

2. The appellant filed her claim for accrued benefits in December 1986, less than a year from the Veteran's death in October 1986.  

3. In March 1987, the appellant was awarded an allowance for plot expenses incurred in conjunction with the Veteran's death but was not awarded accrued benefits and did not appeal that decision.

4. The appellant's most recent application for accrued benefits was received in August 2021, more than a year after the Veteran's death.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to accrued benefits have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5121; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.160, 3.1000.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1941 to September of 1945.  Unfortunately, he died in October 1986.  The appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse.  

This matter comes before the Board on appeal from a February 2023 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) decision and a January 2024 higher level review decision by a VA Regional Office (RO), the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), that denied the appellant her request for accrued benefits as being untimely and because she failed to appeal the RO's March 1987 decision that did not award her accrued benefits.    

In May 2024, the appellant initiated this appeal to the Board with the filing of a Decision Review Request (VA Form 10182), requesting direct review by a Veterans Law Judge on the evidence of record at the time of the February 2023 decision denying the appellant accrued benefits.? In a March 2025 correspondence, the Board acknowledged the appeal and informed the appellant and her representative that the appeal had been placed on the Board's direct review docket.? Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's decision on appeal, here as of February 16, 2023, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.? 38?C.F.R. §?20.301.? If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the February 2023 decision, the Board did not consider it herein.? 38 C.F.R. §§?20.300, 20.301, 20.801.??? 

If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. §?3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the appellant's request for accrued benefits, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Preliminary Matter

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the appellant and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald,?789 F.3d 1375, 1381?(Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake,?21?Vet. App.?545, 552?(2008); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016). 

Entitlement to accrued benefits

Accrued benefits are defined as due and unpaid periodic monetary benefits to which a payee was entitled at his or her death under existing ratings or decisions or based on evidence in the file at date of death.  38 U.S.C. § 5121 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000 (a).  Thus, for an award of accrued benefits there must have been periodic monetary benefits due to the beneficiary at the time of his or her death. 

Upon the death of a veteran, any accrued and unpaid benefits are payable to the living person first listed as follows: (A) the veteran's spouse; (B) the veteran's children (in equal shares); (C) the veteran's dependent parents (in equal shares). 38 U.S.C. § 5121 (a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000 (a)(1).  Upon the death of a surviving spouse or remarried surviving spouse, any accrued and unpaid benefits are payable to the Veteran's children.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1000 (a)(2).  Upon the death of a child, any accrued and unpaid benefits are payable to the surviving children of the veteran entitled to death pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1000 (a)(3).  Upon the death of a child claiming benefits under 38 C.F.R., chapter 18, any accrued and unpaid benefits are payable to the surviving parents.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1000 (a)(4).  In all other cases, only so much of the accrued benefit may be paid as may be necessary to reimburse the person who bore the expense of last sickness or burial.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1000 (a)(5).

An application for accrued benefits must be filed within 1 year after the date of death of the veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5121 (c); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000 (c).  A claim for death pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation, by a surviving spouse, child or parent is deemed to include a claim for any accrued benefits.  38 C.F.R. § 3.152(b).  

In the instant matter, the appellant filed her initial claim for accrued benefits in December 1986, which was within a year after the Veteran's death.  

The Board observes that in the January 2024 higher-level review decision, the AOJ informed the appellant that her claim for accrued benefits had been previously decided, and the appellant failed to file a Notice of Disagreement within one year of that decision and thus, it became final.  In this case, the only decision that mentions accrued benefits is the March 25, 1987, decision granting the appellant an allowance for the plot expenses she incurred in conjunction with the Veteran's death and leaving the section for accrued benefits blank.  Thus, the Board will interpret the March 1987 decision as the decision the appellant failed to appeal within a year of the date of the mailing of that decision.  The Board acknowledges that the March 1987 decision is final, but also notes that even had the appellant timely appealed that decision, which she did not, for the reasons explained below, she would still not be entitled to accrued benefits.    

In this case, the record reflects that the Veteran did not have a pending claim before VA at the time of his death, nor was he owed any unpaid periodic monetary benefits.  

A review of the record indicates that the Veteran submitted a claim for "extreme nervousness aggravated by his asthmatic condition which was service connected" in October 1952.  In a July 1954 rating decision, the RO denied the claim for service connection for extreme nervousness.  See July 1954 Rating Decision.  The Veteran was properly notified of that decision that same month.  See July 1954 Notification Letter.  Thereafter, in June 1984, the Veteran underwent a private examination for housebound status or permanent need for regular aid and attendance, in which a private doctor noted that the Veteran required the daily personal health care services of a skilled provider without which the Veteran would require hospital, nursing home or other institutional care.  In August 1984, the Veteran was notified that his claim for Special Monthly Compensation in the form of aid and attendance was denied, as the June 1984 medical exam showed severe disabilities attributed to conditions that were not service connected, and his service-connected conditions did not meet the scheduled requirements for entitlement to Special Monthly Compensation.  See August 1984 Notification Letter.            

In November 1984, the Veteran filed a claim for disability compensation or pension since he was over the age of 65, had suffered major strokes, was 95 percent blind and incontinent and needed convalescent care and aid and attendance.  See October 1984 VA Form 21-526, Veteran's Application for Compensation or Pension.  Due to the Veteran's incapacitated condition, the appellant was appointed his guardian in June 1985.  See June 1985 Letters of Guardianship: Person.    

In December 1985, the RO granted the Veteran's claim for special monthly pension for regular aid and attendance, effective November 30, 1984, and proposed that the Veteran be rated as incompetent.  See December 1985 Rating Decision.  Thereafter, in January 1986, the Veteran was determined to be incompetent from January 23, 1986.  See January 1986 Rating Decision.  Although special monthly pension was granted, due to the Veteran's annual income, the appellant was informed that the amount of pension payable would be less than what the Veteran was currently receiving for disability compensation, and thus the Veteran's benefits would be continued to be paid pursuant to his entitlement for disability compensation.  See January 1986 Notification Letter.              

Neither the Veteran nor the appellant submitted any communication or evidence that could be construed as an increased rating claim for his service-connected asthma, at any point after the December 1985 rating decision that granted special monthly pension due to the Veteran's need for aid and attendance.  Furthermore, there is no evidence that the appellant, on behalf of the Veteran, filed a new claim for disability compensation prior to the Veteran's death.  Finally, there is no evidence that the appellant, as the Veteran's legal guardian, was not receiving regular disability payments on behalf of the Veteran.  In fact, there is evidence that the appellant was receiving the Veteran's monthly disability check while she and the Veteran were living in Maui, Hawaii.  See March 1986 and May 1986 Request for Change of Address/Cancellation of Direct Deposit.  

Therefore, the Board finds that there were no claims pending prior to the Veteran's death, and there were no periodic monetary benefits due and unpaid to the Veteran at the time of his death, such that no accrued benefits were owed to the Veteran at the time of his death.  

Given that there were no claims pending and no benefits due and payable at the time of the Veteran's death, the criteria for the appellant's eligibility to accrued benefits are not met.  Thus, even had the appellant appealed the March 1987 decision, which she did not, the appellant is not entitled to accrued benefits and her claim for accrued benefits must be denied.  

Finally, neither the appellant nor her representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 69-70 (2017).

Accordingly, the appeal is denied.
