DOCKET NO. 241204-492844
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

The appeal for an effective date prior to August 10, 2021, for award of service connection for tinnitus is dismissed.

Service connection for jungle rot disability is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for a left ankle disability is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for a right ankle disability is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. An unappealed May 2008 rating decision denied service connection for tinnitus, and an unappealed October 2009 rating decision declined to reopen the previously denied claim because new and material evidence had not been received; and these rating decisions are final.

2. The Veteran's October 2023 VA Form 20-0995 supplemental claim requesting readjudication of an October 2021 rating decision awarding service connection for tinnitus effective from August 21, 2021, constitutes a freestanding claim for an earlier effective date that is not authorized by law; and good cause has not been shown to permit an extension of time for filing a VA Form 20-0995.  

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a disability due to, or identified, as jungle rot at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The appeal for entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2021, for the award of service connection for tinnitus is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110; 7105; Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for jungle rot disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1963 to November 1965, to include service in the Republic of Vietnam. His exposure to herbicide agents, including Agent Orange is presumed, and VA has also conceded his participation in a VA also conceded his participation in Toxic Exposure Risk Activities (TERAs) from his military occupational specialty (MOS) as heavy vehicle driver. See other (VA Memo) (October 2023); other (VA Memo) (March 2024); see also 38 U.S.C. §§ 1116, 1117, 1119, 1120; Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, Pub. L. No. 117-168 § 3373, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022). The Veteran has a combined rating of 100 percent and receives special monthly compensation (SMC) under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) from June 2021. See Rating Decision - Codesheet (August 2024). 

In October 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of denial of service connection for bilateral ankles and jungle rot disabilities most recently addressed in a January 2007 rating decision and requested readjudication of the assigned effective date for award of service connection most recently addressed in October 2021 rating decision. On March 5, 2024, and August 21, 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decisions on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claims based on the evidence of record at the time of that decisions, respectively. 

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. A December 2024 Board letter notified the Veteran that he could waive the option to select another Board review option other than Direct Review. See BVA Letter (December 2024) see also Williams v. McDonough, No 21-7363 (U.S. Vet. App. June 21, 2024); see also 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2). The Veteran responded in December 2024, waiving the option to select a different Board review option. See Correspondence (December 2024).

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the respective March 5, 2024, and August 21, 2024, AOJ decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim for service connection for jungle rot disability and assigned effective date for award service connection for tinnitus, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the bilateral ankle disability claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Effective Date 

Generally, the effective date of an award of disability compensation based on an original claim shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless otherwise provided, the effective date of compensation will be fixed in accordance with the facts found but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claimant's application. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). If a claim is filed within one year after separation from service, service connection will be effective as of the day after separation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary. Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660, 57,686 (Sept. 25, 2014) (eff. Mar. 24, 2015). Claims or appeals pending before VA on that date are to be decided based on the regulations as they existed prior to the amendment. Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660, 57,686. Prior to March 24, 2015, a claim was "a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p). An informal claim is "[a]ny communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits." 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a). 

Under the legacy appeal system, which generally applies to rating decisions issued before February 19, 2019, a determination on a claim by the AOJ became final unless an NOD or new and material evidence was received within one year of the date the AOJ mailed notice of the decision. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.200, 20.202, 20.302, 20.1103 (2018); see also Young v. Shineski, 22 Vet. App. 461, 466.

The modernized review system implemented by the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) generally applies to rating decisions issued on or after February 19, 2019; in this system, a VA determination by the AOJ becomes final unless the claimant continuously pursues the claim by filing a supplemental claim, a request for higher-level review, or an appeal to the Board within one year of the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1103, 3.2500(c)(1).

At any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, if VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed but were not associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim, rather than requiring new and material evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c). A claim is not reconsidered, however, where VA could not have obtained the records when it initially decided the claim because the records did not exist at that time, or because the claimant failed to provide sufficient information to identify and obtain the records from the respective service department or any other official source. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(2).

Once a decision becomes final, it can only be revised through a successful claim of clear and unmistakable error (CUE). See 38 C.F.R. § 3.105; see also Cook v. Principi, 318 F.3d 1334, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2002). A claimant cannot attempt to overcome the finality of a prior decision by filing a freestanding claim for an earlier effective date. See Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296, 299-300 (2006); see also Calhoun v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 96, 103 (2024) (under the AMA, a supplemental claim for an earlier effective date filed within one year a decision is not considered a freestanding claim for an earlier effective date because a claimant who continuously pursues an earlier effective date under the AMA is not seeking to overcome the finality of a prior decision, as there is not yet a final decision). When a claimant files an improper freestanding claim for an earlier effective date, the claim should be dismissed. See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 300 (dismissing the appeal and vacating the Board's decision addressing the freestanding earlier effective date claim on the merits because the Board "should not have entertained such an improper 'claim' without imposing the strictures of finality").

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2021, for award of service connection for tinnitus.

An October 18, 2021, rating decision awarded service connection for tinnitus and assigned a 10 percent rating, effective from August 10, 2021. See Rating Decision (October 2021). On October 20, 2023, VA received the Veteran's 20-0995 supplemental claim requesting readjudication of the assigned effective date for award of service connection. See VA Form 20-0995 (October 2023). 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date when he filed his original claim for service connection for tinnitus which was denied in a May 2008 rating decision. See VA Form 20-0995 (October 2023); VA Form 10182 (December 2024). The Veteran asserts that his service connection claim should have been reconsidered under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) to revise the May 2008 rating decision and allow for an effective date prior to August 10, 2021. See VA Form 20-0995 (October 2023); VA Form 10182 (December 2024). 

The Board concludes that the persuasive evidence of record demonstrates that the claim for an effective date prior to August 10, 2021, for the grant of service connection for tinnitus is an improper freestanding claim; and thus, the appeal should be dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006).

By way of procedural history, an August 2000 notification shows the AOJ received the Veteran's initial claim for service connection for tinnitus. See MAP-D Development Letter (August 2000). A May 2008 rating decision denied service connection for this claim because it was neither incurred in nor caused by his military service. See Rating Decision (May 2008). The AOJ specifically noted that there was no evidence of tinnitus in his service treatment records (STRs) and a VA medical opinion concluded his tinnitus was less likely than not a result of his reported military noise exposure. See Rating Decision (May 2008). A June 2008 VA letter notified the Veteran of this decision and how to appeal. See Notification Letter (June 2008). VA did not receive an appeal or new and material evidence prior to expiration of the appeal period; therefore, the rating decision became final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.1100, 20.1103.

In March 2009, the AOJ submitted another request for a complete set of the Veteran's service records, and an April 21, 2009, date stamp shows the AOJ received additional service personnel records (SPRs), even though the electronical file reflects a received date in 2014. See Military Personnel Record (December 2014) 

Next, in June 2009, the AOJ received a petition to reopen a claim for service connection for tinnitus. See VA 21-4138 (June 2009). The AOJ advised the Veteran that his claim was previously denied and explained that new and material was needed to reopen his previously denied claim. See VCAA/DTA Letter (June 2009). An October 2009 rating decision declined to reopen the previously denied claim because new and material evidence had not been received. See Rating Decision (October 2009) (noting the evidence include SPRs received in April 2009). An October 2009 VA letter notified the Veteran of this decision and how to appeal. See Notification Letter (October 2009). VA did not receive an appeal or new and material evidence prior to expiration of the appeal period; therefore, the rating decision became final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 20.1100, 20.1103.

On January 21, 2021, the AOJ received a VA 21-526EZ, formal application, which included a claim for service connection for tinnitus. See VA 21-526EZ (January 2021). In January 2021, the AOJ notified the Veteran that this was the incorrect form, and he was instructed on the proper forms to submit. See Subsequent Development Letter (January 2021). It was indicated that no further action would be taken until he submitted his claim on the proper form. See Id.  Under the AMA, VA regulation concerning appeals to the Board, supplemental claim, and HLR requests requires the use of a specific form. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 3.2501, 3.2601.

On August 10, 2021, the AOJ received the Veteran's supplemental claim application requesting readjudication of his previously denied claim for service connection for tinnitus. See VA Form 20-0995 (August 2021). Thereafter, the October 2021 rating decision granted service connection for tinnitus and assigned an initial 10 percent rating effective August 10, 2021. See Rating Decision (October 2021). Shortly thereafter, the Veteran was notified of that award in a notice letter. See Notification Letter (October 2021). VA received no supplemental claim, higher-level review, or appeal to the Board prior to expiration of the appeal period, and the October 2021 rating decision is final. See is 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400(c)(1), 2.500(c)(1). Thus, the Board finds the Veteran's October 2023 supplemental claim attempting to alter that final decision constitutes an impermissible freestanding earlier effective date claim and must be dismissed. See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 296. 

The record contains Veteran's representative's general request for time extension to file an appeal on any and all rating decisions between March 19, 2019 and June 10, 2023, which would include the October 2021 rating decision. See Third Party Correspondence (May 2023). Specifically, the Veteran's representative asserted a time extension pursuant to VA's Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Financial Relief Actions and Time Limit Extensions until June 10, 2023. See Id. The Board acknowledges that during the COVID-19 national emergency, Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) Policy Letter 20-02, effective on March 1, 2020, and rescinded as of June 10, 2023, included guidance for requests for time limit extensions based on the COVID-19 pandemic and granted under the good cause provisions pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b). See Rescinding Policy Letter 20-02 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Claims and Appeals Processing Guidance (June 5, 2023). Here, the Veteran's filing of his October 2023 supplemental claim was received more than five months after his representative's general extension request in May 2023 and comes four months after VA's rescission of the COVID-19 time extension policy in June 2023; and thus, the general request cannot be applied to this appeal. 

Moreover, the Board finds that good cause has not been shown to extend the time for filing of the October 2023 VA Form 20-0995. 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b) provides that time limits within which claimants or beneficiaries are required to act to perfect a claim or challenge an adverse VA decision may be extended for good cause shown. 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b). Where an extension is requested after expiration of a time limit, the action required of the claimant or beneficiary must be taken concurrent with or prior to the filing of a request for extension of the time limit, and good cause must be shown as to why the required action could not have been taken during the original time period and could not have been taken sooner than it was. 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b). Here, good cause has not been presented as to why the required action could not have been taken prior to the expiration of the time limit in October 2022 nor why the required action could not have been taken sooner than October 2023, more than a year after the expiration of that time limit. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.109(b).

The record shows that the Veteran and his then-representative were fully informed of their rights and obligations with respect to filing a timely supplemental claim, higher-level review, or appeal to the Board prior to expiration of the appeal period in October 2022. Notably, the October 2021 rating decision was properly mailed to the Veteran and his then-representative at that time, with accompanying instructions on the various avenues for disagreeing with the RO's determination, including via VA Form 20-0995. See Notification Letter (October 2021).  There is no evidence that this letter did not reach either party and the Veteran has not asserted otherwise. Although the Veteran switched representation in December 2022, he had the same representative at the time of the issuance of the October 2021 notification letter and for the remainder of period prior expiration of the filing deadline. See VA Form 21-22a (December 2020) (identify attorney (Cameron)); VA Form 21-22a (December2022) (appointing current attorney-representative); Agent Fee Agreement (December 2022) (noting who is current attorney at same firm as prior attorney (Cameron)). Thus, both the Veteran and his then-representative were afforded clear and meaningful instructions for submitting a timely VA Form 10182 to the referenced rating decision but failed to do so. On this basis, the October 2023 VA Form 20-0995 is untimely.

There is also no argument or assertion that the Veteran even attempted to submit a supplemental claim, higher-level review, or appeal to the Board during the one-year submission period, let alone that the submission did not reach VA due to the circumstances surrounding COVID-19. Rather, the Board notes that VA's guidance regarding the pandemic was published in 2020 in effect for almost three years and the Veteran and his representative was able to submit three HLR requests and one supplemental claim in that one year appeal period between October 2021 to October 2022. See VA Form 20-0996 (November 2021); VA Form 20-0996 (December 2021); VA Form 20-0995 (January 2022); VA Form 20-0996 (September 2022). Thus, the Board finds that good cause has not been presented to extend the time to continuously pursue the October 2021 rating decision, and it is final. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1103, 3.2500(c)(1).

Turing to the Veteran's specific contention that an earlier effective date for service connection claim is appropriate as the Veteran's claim should have been reconsidered under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) and affecting the finality of the May 2008 rating decision as a basis for an effective date prior to August 2021. See VA Form 20-0995 (October 2023); VA Form 10182 (December 2024). However, the Board finds that 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) is not applicable and cannot be used to provide for an earlier effective date. At any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, if VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed but were not associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim, rather than requiring new and material evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1). In contrast to the general rule governing disallowed claims, § 3.156(c) requires VA to reconsider a veteran's claim when relevant service department records are newly associated with the veteran's claims file, whether or not they are "new and material" under § 3.156(a). Blubaugatty v. McDonald, 773 F.3d 1310, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2014).

Here, the Veteran asserts that additional service department records were associated with the claims file after the 2008 and 2009 rating decisions. See VA Form 20-0995 (October 2023); VA Form 10182 (December 2024). However, the May 2008 rating decision reflects that STRs were associated with the claims file at the time of the initial rating decision, which specifically reference consideration of the Veteran's entrance and separation examination reports. See Rating Decision (May 2008). Although the electronic claims folder shows a receival date of December 2014, it is clear from the May 2008 rating decision that the Veteran's STRs were of record, and specifically considered in that initial rating decision. See STR - Medical (December 2014), compared with Rating Decision (May 2008). Thereafter, additional service department records were associated with the claims file in April 2009, as demonstrated by the date stamped received by the AOJ, as opposed the electronic file's receival date. See Military Personnel Records (December 2014); see also Rating Decision (October 2009) (noting receipt of SPRs in April 2009). However, in the October 2009 rating decision the AOJ declined to reopen the previously denied claim for service connection and did not review the underlying claim. See Rating Decision (October 2009). 

Even though VA received additional service department records in April 2009 and again, in January 2016, those records only provided information which was already known concerning his active service, such as his military occupational specialty (MOS), and medical records which are either duplicative of STRs reviewed at the time of the May 2008 initial rating decision or do not contain relevant information concerning tinnitus. See Military Personnel Records, date stamped received April 20, 2009, (December 2014); Military Personnel Records (January 2016); see also VA Examination (April 2008) (VA audiology examination noting military service included MOS as heavy vehicle driver). The Board finds these additional service department records are not relevant to the claim for tinnitus, insofar as they do not contain new information that tends to show tinnitus either incurred in or aggravated by service and thus, does not require the originating agency to reconsider that matter. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c); Kisor v. Wilkie, 969 F.3d 1333, 134143 (Fed. Cir. 2020) ("Relevant" means service records that speak to a matter in issue or in dispute.) Therefore, reconsideration of the May 2008 or October 2009 rating decision based on receipt of additional service department records in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) is not applicable and cannot provide for an effective date prior to August 10, 2021.

The record shows the May 2008 and June 2009 rating decisions became final, and also the October 2021 rating decision assigning as the effective date of August 10, 2020, for an award of service connection for tinnitus became final. Thus, the Board finds the Veteran's October 2023 supplemental claim attempting to alter that final rating decision constitutes an impermissible freestanding earlier effective date claim and must be dismissed. See Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 296. 

The only other avenue to contest the effective date assigned would be via a claim of CUE. However, a claim of CUE is not before the Board at this time. To the extent that the representative argues that there was CUE in a rating decision, this is not before the Board and must be addressed by the AOJ in the first instance. See Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326 (2006); Phillips v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 25 (1997) (noting that a CUE motion and a claim seeking an earlier effective date are not the same or inextricably intertwined because while the effective date element flows directly from the award of service connection, a CUE motion may be brought at any time and is premised upon an error in a prior final RO adjudication). Here, the record contains the Veteran's assertions that he should have assigned an earlier effective date based on reconsideration of May 2008 rating decision under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c); however, neither he nor his representative has not pled allegations of CUE with specificity nor identified CUE in a rating decision. See VA Form 20-0995 (October 2023) (requesting "revision/reconsideration of 06/02/2008 [May 2008] rating decision based on 3.156(c) for tinnitus).  VA Form 10182 (December 2024) (requesting "revision of 6/02/2008 rating decision based on 3.156(c) for tinnitus"). 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c) provides an exception to the general rules governing finality and it does provide the basis for reversal or revision of a final decision on the basis of CUE. See Vigil v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 63, 66-67 (2008) (under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c), "the original claim is not just re-opened, it is reconsidered and serves as the date of the claim and the earliest date for which benefits may be granted"); see also Blubaugh v. McDonald, 773 F.3d 1310, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (reconsidered under 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c) treats the claim as though the prior rating action never existed). The point of § 3.156(c) is to put a Veteran in the position he or she would have been had VA obtained and considered relevant service department records before adjudicating their earlier claims; thus, the claim is not treated as a new and material evidence claim or a CUE claim but is governed instead by § 3.156(c). See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c). Ultimately, in this case, the Board finds that VA has not received a valid motion for revision of a rating decision based on CUE. CUE must be pled with specificity, which means that the CUE claim is based on an assertion that is more than a mere disagreement with how the facts of a case were weighed or evaluated. Andre v. West, 14 Vet. App. 7, 10 (2000). The Veteran is advised he may file of motion for revision or reversal based on CUE in an RO decision under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 5109A and must be plead with specificity.

The Board is bound by the laws and regulations of VA. 38 U.S.C. § 7104. To the extent that the Veteran has attempted to raise a freestanding earlier effective date claim and in light of Rudd, the claim of entitlement to an effective date for the award of TDIU is dismissed. Rudd, 20 Vet. App. at 299-300. The Board may dismiss any appeal that fails to allege an error of fact or law. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(5); 38 C.F.R. § 20.302. 

Accordingly, the claim is dismissed as a matter of law. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred or aggravated during active military service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131. Generally, service connection requires (1) the existence of a present disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004)

2. Entitlement to service connection for a jungle rot disability. 

The Veteran contends he has jungle rot as a result of his military service. See VA Form 20-0995 (October 2023); VA Form 10182 (December 2024). He reports shortly after his separation from service in November 1965 "Dr. Ford examined me and asked where I had been, he told me that I had jungle rot" See VA 21-526 (September 2006). The Veteran has not provided any further argument in support of claim. 

The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current disability involving jungle rot and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claims or recent to the filing of the claim. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366; Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a), (d).

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STR) revealed no treatment or diagnosis of any condition or symptoms attributed to "jungle rot." See STR-Medical (December 2014). No post-service medical record shows treatment or diagnosis of disability described as "jungle rot" by a medical provider. Although the Veteran identified being examined by Dr. Ford and specifically being told he had "jungle rot" after clinical evaluation, the Veteran did not respond to VA's subsequent development letter specifically requesting him to complete a VA Form 21-4142 (authorization and general release to obtain records from medical provider) for Dr. Ford so VA could attempt to obtain those records. See VCAA/DTA Letter (October 2006). VA's duty to assist requires VA to make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in securing evidence necessary to substantiate their claim for VA benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c). Here, VA sent subsequent development letter with a VA Form 21-4142 specifically requesting the Veteran's assistance in obtaining identified records from Dr. Ford. The duty to assist is a two-way street and due to the Veteran's nonresponse to the request for information, the Board finds there is no further duty to provide development regarding the Veteran's private treatment records and will proceed with adjudication of the claims. See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991). The Board finds the AOJ satisfied its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A by sending subsequent development letter with a VA Form 21-4142 specifically requesting the Veteran's assistance in obtaining identified records from Dr. Ford and there is no pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring a remand for corrective action. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). 

Next, while a private psychiatric evaluation report dated in July 2014 notes the Veteran a history of "jungle rot so bad," no further explanation was provided on the nature, severity, duration, or location of the claimed "jungle rot" and the private report also indicates the Veteran only provided that limited information after prompting by the private psychologist and not in relation to a physical medical examination; the report contains no formal diagnosis or identifies symptomatology for the claimed jungle rot. See Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility (August 2014). Further, VA treatment records do not indicate symptoms or disability attributable to jungle rot. See CAPRI (September 2021); CAPRI (September 2022); CAPRI (January 2024).

The Veteran has not submitted or identified any post-service medical evidence that shows treatment for or a diagnosis of his claimed jungle rot despite being directed to do so. See VCAA/DTA Letter (October 2006) (advising the Veteran to submit evidence demonstrating the presence of current jungle rot from military to present to support his claim). To the extent that the Veteran is competent to describe symptoms that are capable of lay observation, the Board notes that he has not submitted any lay statements describing the nature, severity, duration, or location of his claimed jungle rot. Additionally, the Veteran has not identified, and the medical record does not indicate, that he has or has had symptoms attributable to jungle rot that have caused him functional impairment of earning capacity. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (finding that if pain alone results in functional impairment, even if there is no identified underlying diagnosis, such pain can constitute a disability); see also Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8 (2020) (finding that to establish the presence of a disability pursuant to Saunders, there must be competent evidence specific to the claimant tending to show that his or her impairment rises to a level to affect earning capacity).

While the Veteran believes he has a jungle rot disability warranting VA compensation, the record does not indicate that the Veteran has the require medical knowledge and training of bodily systems to render a diagnosis of a disability. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1) (competent medical evidence means evidence provided by a person who is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions). The Veteran is not competent to diagnose himself with a jungle rot disability. 

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for service connection and VA disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Evidence must show that the Veteran currently has the disability for which benefits are being claimed. Here, the Board finds there is no competent lay or medical evidence of record that persuasively establishes that he has a current jungle rot disability or that he has had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. 

Without evidence of a disability of, or result of, jungle rot, the evidence is persuasively against the claim. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Accordingly, the claim is denied. 

Lastly, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran was not provided a VA examination for his claim jungle rot. Because there is no evidence of a current disability, VA's duty to assist in providing an examination was not triggered as to the claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4)(i); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006). Furthermore, as the Veteran does not have a current disability manifested by his claimed jungle rot, additional development concerning potential for TERA participation and requirements for medical examination and opinion provisions under 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a) are not applicable. See Sergeant First Class (SFC) Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, Pub. L. No. 117-168 (2022); VBA Letter 20-22-10 at 10-13, Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, 87 Fed. Reg. 78,543 (Dec. 22, 2022).

REASONS FOR REMAND

In remanding these matters, the Board makes no finding, implicit or otherwise, as to the credibility of the Veteran's assertions. Neither the Veteran's credibility nor any lack thereof should be presumed in this remand.

1. Entitlement to service connection for left ankle disability is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for right ankle disability is remanded.

The Veteran asserts his current bilateral ankle disability had an onset during his military service when he injured both ankles during basic training and experienced bilateral ankle pain. See VA Form 21-526 (September 2006); C&P Exam (June 2024). 

STRs include his March 1963 report of medical history (RMH) pre-enlistment with a positive history for "both ankles weak - turn easily" but normal bilateral lower extremity on clinical evaluation on his October 1963 report of medical examination (RME) at induction. See STR-Medical (December 2014). Next, a November 1963 STR shows the Veteran had swollen and painful left ankle as result of twisting injury to days ago, and he was assessed with strain and placed on limited duty for three days. See STR-Medical (December 2014). No subsequent complaints or treatment for ankle-related problems and he received normal clinical evaluation of his bilateral lower extremities on his October 1965 RME at separation. See STR-Medical (December 2014). Post-service medical records show complaints of ankle pain and assessment of arthralgia involving the ankles in 2006, and a June 2024 VA-obtained ankle examination report shows diagnoses of chronic/recurrent bilateral ankle sprain. See Medical Treatment Record - Government Facility (January 2007); C&P Exam (June 2024). 

The issues of entitlement to service connection are remanded to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the decision on appeal.

First, VA's duty to assist claimants includes obtaining records in the custody of a Federal department or agency, or if unavailable, informing the Veteran as to the unavailability of those Federally held records. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(1), (e). Here, VA treatment records indicate that the Veteran received treatment prior to October 1998 at VA medical facility in Columbus; however, the record only contains records from that facility dated from October 1998 to January 2007. See CAPRI (April 2022). Specifically, an October 1998 VA treatment records notes the Veteran presented for a follow-up appointment - indicating he had received prior treatment at that facility. See CAPRI (April 2022). The record does not show that the RO sought to obtain VA treatment records prior to October 1998, despite the record identifying prior VA treatment. Thus, as these records have not been requested, a remand is required. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(b), (c); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c); see also Sullivan v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 786 (Fed. Cir. 2016). 

Also, the record shows the Veteran receives disability benefits from the Social Security Administration (SSA) since 2002. See VA Form 20-0995 (January 2024). VA has a duty to obtain SSA records when it has actual notice that a veteran has applied for SSA benefits. See Murincsak v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 363 (1992); see also Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (VA's duty to assist includes obtaining relevant Social Security records).

Second, VA has a duty to assist claimants include obtaining reasonably identified relevant outstanding non-VA (private) treatment records. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(e)(2) (if VA becomes aware of the existence of relevant records before deciding a claim, VA will, among other things, request that the claimant provide a release for the records). Here, prior to the decision on appeal, the Veteran submitted a June 2008 private medical statement indicating relevant treatment record Physical Therapy Services noting eight visits for bilateral lower extremity problems; however, the record does not contain the referenced treatment sessions, including initial evaluation. See General Records Request (Medical) (August 2008). Nor does the record reveal that VA attempted to obtain the referenced records, to include asking the Veteran to submit an authorization for release of the private treatment records, prior to issuing the decision on appeal. 

Therefore, remand is necessary to correct the duty to assist errors on the part of the originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A, which occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

Lastly, although the Veteran has participation in TERAs based on his presumed exposure to herbicide agents and based on his MOS as heavy vehicle driver and VA has an obligation to obtain medical opinions for any service connection claim which cannot be granted where there is evidence of a TERA and of a disability, VA has identified several exceptions to this general obligation where there is no indication of an association between the disability and the TERA. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168(b). Here, given the Veteran's assertion that his bilateral ankle disability is result of in-service injury (physical trauma), VA is not required to obtain an opinion under 38 U.S.C. § 1168 in these matters. VBA Letter 20-24-06 at 12-14, Updated Guidance on Processing Claims Involving the PACT Act, (June 12, 2024). Thus, an exception to the TERA opinion requirements applies, and remand for an examination is not warranted on this basis.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain the Veteran's VA treatment records dated prior to October 1998.

2. Obtain the Veteran's relevant SSA records. If any records cannot be obtained after reasonable efforts have been made, issue a formal determination that such records do not exist or that further efforts to obtain such records would be futile, which should be documented in the claims file. The Veteran must be notified of the attempts made and why further attempts would be futile and allowed the opportunity to provide such records.

3. Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for Physical Therapy Services in 2008. Make two requests for the authorized records from the identified provider, unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.
