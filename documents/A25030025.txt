ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of September 1, 2023, but no earlier, for the 100 percent disability rating of lymphomatoid papulosis, to include mycosis fungoides, and painful scarring, (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A June 19, 2018, Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision granted entitlement to a 60 percent rating from June 10, 2013, for lymphomatoid papulosis.  

2. An April 26, 2019, United States Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (Court) Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR) returned consideration of rating for lymphomatoid papulosis prior to June 10, 2013, to the Board.  

3. A September 6, 2019, Board decision granted entitlement to a 60 percent rating prior to June 10, 2013, for lymphomatoid papulosis.  

4. No further appeal was received following the September 6, 2019, Board decision.  

5. The June 19, 2018, Board decision granting entitlement to a 60 percent rating from June 10, 2013, for lymphomatoid papulosis, and the September 6, 2019, Board decision granting entitlement to a 60 percent rating prior to June 10, 2013, for lymphomatoid papulosis, became final.

6. On September 1, 2023, the Veteran's dermatologist confirmed the Veteran's lymphomatoid papulosis is "active" non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with new lesions, requiring continual medication.

7. The Veteran submitted a September 12, 2023, intent to file, followed by the December 6, 2023, fully developed claim for increased rating of lymphomatoid papulosis, to include mycosis fungoides, as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of September 1, 2023, but no earlier, for the 100 percent disability rating of lymphomatoid papulosis, to include mycosis fungoides, and painful scarring (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty with the United States Navy from February 1997 to April 2008.

This case comes before the Board on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a February 2024 decision.  In March 2024 the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior February 2024 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 decision and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Earlier Effective Date

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the "facts found", but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

For claims for higher ratings, in general, the effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if an application is received within one year from that date.  Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of VA receipt of the claim for increase, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

The Court has explained that, in an original claim for service connection, the date entitlement arose is governed by the date the claim is received, not the date of the medical evidence submitted to support a particular claim.  See McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28 (2000).  Where a prior unappealed decision becomes final and binding on a Veteran, the effective date of a subsequent award of service connection is the date of receipt of a reopened claim, not the date of receipt of the original claim.  Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244 (2002); Melton v. West, 13 Vet. App. 442 (2000).

Effective March 24, 2015, to initiate a claim, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA.  38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a).  The term "claim" means a communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p).

A claimant, or certain other individuals as specified in section 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b), may indicate a claimant's intent to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant.  Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

Where a prior AOJ decision is final and binding it will be accepted as correct in the absence of clear and unmistakable error (CUE).  Where evidence establishes such error, the prior decision will be reversed or amended.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(a).  

Where a prior Board decision is final and binding it will be accepted as correct in the absence of CUE.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1400.  Board decisions which have been appealed to, and decided by, a court of competent jurisdiction, are not subject to review under 38 C.F.R. § 20.1400.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.1400(a).

Factual Background

The October 2011 rating decision granted the Veteran service connection for folliculitis with atypical infiltrate (claimed as a skin rash), rated 10 percent disabling, effective July 15, 2011.

The January 12, 2015, rating decision granted a 60 percent disability rating, effective June 10, 2013, for lymphomatoid papulosis (formerly rated as folliculitis with atypical infiltrate). 

The June 2018 Board decision denied entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent prior to June 10, 2013, and in excess of 60 percent thereafter, for skin disorder, diagnosed as lymphoid papulosis.  The June 2018 Board decision remanded the matter of an earlier effective date than July 15, 2011.     

The April 2019 Court decision granted the JMPR agreed by the parties and returned consideration of rating for lymphomatoid papulosis prior to June 10, 2013, to the Board.  The Veteran did not challenge the portion of the Board decision that denied entitlement to a rating higher than 60 percent disabling from June 10, 2013, for service-connected skin disorder.  

The September 2019 Board decision granted an initial rating of 60 percent disabling, but no higher, for skin disability (diagnosed as lymphomatoid papulosis, and mycosis fungoides).

The January 2022 VA treatment record notes the Veteran's dermatology out-patient visit.  The January 2022 VA treatment record gives a diagnosis of lymphomatoid papulosis, with the most recent biopsy in 2020.  The January 2022 VA treatment record notes the Veteran has a flare-up on his legs and his weekly prescription of Methotrexate was increased.  

The September 1, 2023, VA treatment record contains the letter of Dr. B.P. the Veteran's dermatologist.  Dr. B.P. confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis of lymphomatoid papulosis is a form of lymphoproliferative disease that is under the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  Dr. B.P. noted that in the Veteran's previous exam he referred to the Veteran's lymphomatoid papulosis as flaring.  Dr. B.P. states the fact the Veteran's lymphomatoid papulosis remains present while taking Methotrexate means the Veteran's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is active.  

The Veteran submitted the September 12, 2023, intent to file, followed by the December 6, 2023, fully developed claim for an increased rating of lymphomatoid papulosis as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

The February 15, 2024, VA medical exam reviewed the Veteran's record and confirmed the Veteran's diagnosis of lymphomatoid papulosis, to include mycosis fungoides, and painful scarring, as a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  The February 2024 VA medical exam confirmed the Veteran was prescribed weekly Methotrexate.  

The February 16, 2024, VA addendum opinion clarified the Veteran's service-connected condition is due to the underlying cause but there is no new condition.  The examiner confirmed there is a worsening of the Veteran's symptoms but there is no additional diagnosis.  The examiner explained the cause of the Veteran's condition is now known as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  The Veteran's condition is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that causes scaly patches or bumps known as lesions or tumors.  

Analysis 

The Veteran argues he is entitled to a 100 percent disability rating from the July 15, 2011, the effective date of service connection for atypical infiltrate (claimed as a skin rash), as it is now established to be active non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and has remained so to the present.

For the reason's set out below, the Board finds the Veteran is entitled to an earlier effective date of September 1, 2023, but no earlier, for the 100 percent rating of lymphomatoid papulosis, to include mycosis fungoides, and painful scarring, as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

The Board finds the Veteran did not challenge the portion of the June 2018 Board decision that denied entitlement to a rating higher than 60 percent disabling from June 10, 2013, for service-connected skin disorder.  This is confirmed in the April 2019 Court JMPR.  The Board finds the Veteran did not seek to appeal the September 2019 Board decision granting an initial rating of 60 percent disabling, but no higher, for skin disability (diagnosed as lymphomatoid papulosis, and mycosis fungoides).  

The Board finds the June 2018 Board decision that denied entitlement to a rating higher than 60 percent disabling from June 10, 2013, for service-connected skin disorder and September 2019 Board decision granting an initial rating of 60 percent disabling, but no higher, for skin disability (diagnosed as lymphomatoid papulosis, and mycosis fungoides) are final.

The Board notes a final and binding Board decision is accepted as correct in the absence of CUE.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1400.  The Board finds the Veteran has made no allegation the June 2018 Board decision (in pertinent part) or September 2019 Board decision are incorrect due to CUE.  The Board finds there is no evidence of record the June 2018 Board decision (in pertinent part) or September 2019 Board decision incorrectly understood the evidence of record at the time of the decisions or misapplied the regulations at the time of the decisions.  Rather, the Veteran argues there is evidence, that was not previously of record, to show his diagnosis of lymphomatoid papulosis has always been a form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

The Board finds 38 C.F.R. § 20.1403(d)(1) specifically identifies that a new medical diagnosis that "corrects" an earlier diagnosis considered in a Board decision is not a CUE.  

The Board finds the evidence of record does not support an effective date of July 15, 2011, for the 100 percent rating of lymphomatoid papulosis, to include mycosis fungoides, and painful scarring, as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

However, the Board finds, on the basis of "facts found", the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of September 1, 2023, for the 100 percent rating of lymphomatoid papulosis, to include mycosis fungoides, and painful scarring, as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  As set out above, the effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if an application is received within one year from that date.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

The Board finds the September 1, 2023, VA treatment record containing the letter of Dr. B.P. confirms the Veteran's diagnosis of lymphomatoid papulosis is a form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  Dr. B.P. further noted that in the Veteran's previous exam the Veteran's lymphomatoid papulosis was flaring.  

The Board finds the previous VA treatment record of January 2022 is more than a year prior to the Veteran's September 12, 2023, intent to file, and cannot provide an earlier effective date on the basis of "facts found".  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o) (2).

The Board finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence is in favor of finding, on the basis of "facts found", the Veteran experienced a worsening of his service-connected skin condition, which was diagnosed as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, on September 1, 2023, which is within a year of receipt of the September 12, 2023, intent to file.  At a minimum, the positive evidence in favor of the earlier effective date claim and the negative evidence against the claim are "nearly equal" or "in approximate balance."   

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).  Therefore, after resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the evidence supports an?effective date?of September 1, 2023, but no earlier, for the100 percent disability rating of lymphomatoid papulosis, to include mycosis fungoides, and painful scarring, (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma).

Accordingly, an?effective date?of September 1, 2023, but no earlier, for the 100 percent disability rating of lymphomatoid papulosis, to include mycosis fungoides, and painful scarring, (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) is warranted, and the appeal-to this extent-is hereby GRANTED.  38?U.S.C. §?5107(b);?38?C.F.R. §?3.102.
