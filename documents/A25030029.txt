FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Effective December 12, 2022, the Veteran's service-connected right foot hallux valgus was not manifested by severe symptoms (equivalent of amputation of great toe), and he did not undergo an operation with resections of the metatarsal heads.

2. Effective December 12, 2022, the Veteran's service-connected left foot hallux valgus was not manifested by severe symptoms (equivalent of amputation of great toe), and he did not undergo an operation with resections of the metatarsal heads.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for right foot hallux valgus, effective December 12, 2022, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.10, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Code 5280.

2. The criteria for an initial compensable rating for left foot hallux valgus, effective December 12, 2022, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1-4.10, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, Code 5280.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Army from August 1974 to August 1976. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which granted service connection for left and right foot hallux valgus with an evaluation of 0 percent and denied service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder. See February 2024 rating decision. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Veteran is in receipt of a 10 percent rating for his right foot achilles bursitis. The Veteran is also in receipt of a 10 percent rating for left and right  lower extremity radiculopathy, See most recent codesheet.

Increase Rating - Hallux Valgus

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. It is not expected that every case will show every criterion for a particular rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38 C.F.R. Part 4.

Hallux Valgus or Bunion is considered one of the most common foot deformities and is described as lateral deviation of the hallux. Diagnostic Code 5280 provides the rating criteria for Hallux valgus. 

Under DC 5280 The maximum allowable rating of 10 percent is assigned for unilateral Hallux Valgus when it is operated with resection of metatarsal head; or, severe, if equivalent to amputation of great toe. 

Under Code 5280, hallux valgus that is severe, if equivalent to amputation of great toe, is rated 10 percent disabling. Hallux valgus that has been operated upon with resection of the metatarsal head is also rated 10 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Code 5280.

Because hallux valgus is directly contemplated by the Rating Schedule under Code 5280, respectively, consideration of whether other diagnostic codes would provide for a higher rating is not appropriate. See Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 336-38 (2015) (holding that, "as a matter of law, Code 5284 does not apply to the eight [other] foot conditions specifically listed in § 4.71a," so listed conditions could not be rated by analogy under that Diagnostic Code).

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for right foot hallux valgus with callus effective December 12, 2022, is denied.

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left foot hallux valgus with callus effective December 12, 2022, is denied.

The Veteran first applied for service connection of his bilateral foot condition in December 2022. See December 2022 fully developed claim.

The Veteran was offered a VA examination in January 2024. See January 2024 VA Examination. The Veteran was diagnosed with bilateral hallux valgus, achilles bursitis of the right foot, and gout. The examiner noted that the Veteran has never had surgery for hallux valgus. Id. The examiner noted that the Veteran experiences 'mild or moderate symptoms.' The examiner noted that the Veteran does not experience 'severe symptoms, with function equivalent to amputation of great toe.' 

According to Merriam-Webster's Dictionary, "mild" means not very severe. See Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mild. "Moderate" means limited in scope or effect. See Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moderate. "Severe" means very painful or harmful or of a great degree. See Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/severe. Although a medical examiner's use of descriptive terminology such as "mild" is an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, it is not dispositive of an issue. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.  Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. 

As the Veteran's left and right foot hallux valgus has never been operated and is not severe or equivalent to amputation of great toe, a compensable 10 percent evaluation is not warranted. 

In every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 C.F.R. §4.31. 

A higher evaluation of 10 percent is not warranted for unilateral hallux valgus unless the evidence shows: operated with resection of metatarsal head; or, painful motion; or, severe, if equivalent to amputation of great toe. 38 CFR 4.71a. 

Therefore, entitlement to an initial compensable rating for left and right foot hallux valgus effective December 12, 2022, must be denied. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Code 5280.

REASONS FOR REMAND 

Service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is remanded.

The AOJ did not obtain a medical opinion prior to the rating decision on appeal. The RO denied the Veteran's claim in a February 2024 rating decision because the medical evidence of record failed to show that a disability was clinically diagnosed. See February 2024 rating decision. A diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder must meet all diagnostic criteria as stated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association. The RO stated that the evidence does not show a confirmed diagnosis of PTSD under the DSM-5 criteria. 

The VA's duty to assist includes obtaining a medical examination or opinion when such is necessary to decide on the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). The duty to assist requires the VA to provide a medical examination if there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) evidence that the an event, injury or disease occurred in service; (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the established in-service event, injury or disease or with another service-connected disability; and (4) there is insufficient competent medical evidence on which to decide the claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). See also McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 85-86 (2006).

The Veteran first applied for service connection for PTSD in December 2022. See December 2022 fully developed claim. 

In a December 2022 Statement in Support of Claim for PTSD the Veteran alleged Military Sexual Trauma (MST) incidents that occurred in service. In a December 2022 Statement in Support of Claim the Veteran reported: "since leaving the military I've noticed a significant change in myself... I avoid people. Almost every week in the last month, I found myself reliving the things I witnessed in the military through distressing memories. Things easily startle me and make me tense... I always keep an eye on my surroundings... I'm currently employed part time at Amazon fulfillment. I was there for five years, and I resigned in October because of my cancer condition but I was able to go back in November." The Veteran reported that his mental health condition has impacted his occupation and social life. 

The RO committed a pre-decisional duty to assist error by not affording the Veteran a VA examination. In this case, there are (1) competent evidence of persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability; (2) evidence that an event, injury or disease occurred in service; (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with an in-service event, injury or disease. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). See also McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 85-86 (2006). The matter must be remanded for a VA examination and opinion. 

Accordingly, this matter is REMANDED for the following actions:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a psychiatric examination to determine the nature and etiology of any acquired psychiatric condition or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). If the Veteran is diagnosed with PTSD, the examiner must explain how the diagnostic criteria are met and opine whether it is at least as likely as not related to a verified in-service stressor.  

If any other acquired psychiatric disorders are diagnosed, the examiner must opine whether each diagnosed disorder is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.  

If the Veteran is diagnosed with a personality disorder and PTSD - The examiner must opine whether the PTSD was at least as likely as not superimposed on a personality disorder during active service and resulted in additional disability.

If the Veteran's stressor is based on an in-service personal assault - The examiner must opine whether the evidence of record, including the Veteran's lay statements and service records, corroborate the claim that a personal assault occurred in service (38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(5)). If the examiner finds that evidence indicates that a personal assault occurred during the Veteran's active service, the examiner must opine whether any PTSD is at least as likely as not related to the in-service personal assault.

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for his or her opinion(s) in the examination report. If any of the above requested opinions cannot be made without resort to speculation, the examiner must state this and provide a rationale for such conclusion. In so doing, the reviewing clinician must explain whether the inability to provide a more definitive opinion is the result of a need for additional information, or that he or she has exhausted the limits of current medical knowledge in providing an answer to that question.
