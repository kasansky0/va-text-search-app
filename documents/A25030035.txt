REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service in the United States Army from August 1984 to May 1988.  These matters are on appeal from May 2023 and February 2024 rating decisions.

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 and February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of entitlement to earlier effective dates for the grants of a TDIU and eligibility for DEA benefits, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Factual Background

On October 25, 2019, the Veteran filed his initial claim of entitlement to service connection for back pain.

In December 2019, the Veteran was afforded a VA back examination.  The VA examiner diagnosed lumbosacral strain and degenerative arthritis of the spine.  The Veteran reported flare-ups which decreased his ability to sit for prolonged periods, bend, and lift.  Initial range of motion studies disclosed forward flexion to 70 degrees; extension to 25 degrees; right lateral flexion to 30 degrees; left lateral flexion to 30 degrees; right lateral rotation to zero degrees; and, left lateral rotation to zero degrees.  Repetitive-use testing showed forward flexion to 60 degrees; extension to 20 degrees; right lateral flexion to 30 degrees; left lateral flexion to 30 degrees; right lateral rotation to zero degrees; and left lateral rotation to zero degrees.  The VA examiner estimated that with repeated-use over time and during flare-ups the Veteran's ranges of motion would be the same as the ranges of motion disclosed during repetitive-use testing.  Guarding and muscle spasm were absent.  Muscle strength, reflex, and sensory testing were all normal.  The Veteran did not have any symptoms related to radiculopathy.

In January 2020, the AOJ issued a rating decision which granted service connection for lumbosacral strain and assigned a 10 percent evaluation effective October 25, 2019.  Subsequently, in February 2020, the AOJ issued another rating decision which assigned a 20 percent evaluation for the Veteran's degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine with strain effective October 25, 2019.

On October 6, 2021, the Veteran filed a claim for a TDIU.  In January 2022, the AOJ issued a rating decision which denied the Veteran's claim for a TDIU.

On March 13, 2022, VA received the Veteran's intent to file a claim for compensation.

In October 2022, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim related to his claim for a TDIU.  In his corresponding VA Form 21-8940, the Veteran asserted that all of his service-connected disabilities prevented him from maintaining substantially gainful employment.  He post-service employment consisted of call center work and work as a porter at a hotel.  He last worked January 31, 2007.

In October 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA back examination.  The VA examiner degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine with strain and radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities.  The Veteran endorsed flare-ups with overuse.  Initial range of motion studies disclosed forward flexion to 30 degrees; extension to 5 degrees; right lateral flexion to 10 degrees; left lateral flexion to 10 degrees; right lateral rotation to 10 degrees; and left lateral rotation to 10 degrees.  Pain was noted on all ranges of motion and caused functional loss.  The Veteran was able to complete repetitive use testing without additional loss of function or range of motion.  The VA examiner found that pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, and incoordination would not significantly limit functional ability with repeated use over time.  She estimated that during flare-ups the Veteran would have forward flexion to 25 degrees; extension to zero degrees; right lateral flexion to 5 degrees; left lateral flexion to 5 degrees; right lateral rotation to 5 degrees, and left lateral rotation to 5 degrees.  Muscle strength testing showed active movement against some resistance for the bilateral lower extremities.  Reflexes for the bilateral lower extremities were hypoactive.  There was decreased sensation for the bilateral ankles, feet, and toes.  The Veteran endorsed severe constant pain, intermittent pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness.  Muscular atrophy was absent.  The VA examiner identified the bilateral sciatic nerves as the source of the Veteran's radiculopathy.  The Veteran did not have intervertebral disc syndrome.  

In February 2023, the AOJ issued a rating decision which assigned 40 percent evaluations for degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine with strain, radiculopathy of the right lower extremity, radiculopathy of the left lower extremity, and granted a TDIU and eligibility for DEA benefits effective March 13, 2022.

In February 2023, the Veteran submitted a Higher-Level Review regarding the effective dates assigned for the grant of a TDIU and eligibility for DEA benefits.  In May 2023, the AOJ issued a rating decision, which denied effective dates prior to March 13, 2022, for the grants of TDIU and eligibility for DEA benefits.

In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a Higher-Level Review regarding the evaluations assigned for degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine with strain, radiculopathy of the right lower extremity, and radiculopathy of the left lower extremity and the effective date assigned for the grants of service connection for radiculopathy of the left and right lower extremities.

In February 2024, the AOJ issued a rating decision which denied higher evaluations for degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine with strain, radiculopathy of the left lower extremity, and radiculopathy and effective dates prior March 13, 2022, for the grants of service connection for radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities.  Subsequently, in May 2023, the AOJ issued a rating decision, which denied effective dates prior to March 13, 2022, for the grants of a TDIU and eligibility for DEA benefits.

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 13, 2022, for the grant of service connection for radiculopathy of the left lower extremity.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 13, 2022, for the grant of service connection for radiculopathy of the right lower extremity.

Generally, the effective date of an award based on a reopened claim after a final disallowance is either the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  VA also recognizes an intent to file a claim, which may be submitted electronically, on a prescribed intent to file claim form, or through an oral communication to certain VA employees that is later recorded in writing.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b)(1)(i)-(iii).  If VA receives a complete claim application form within one year of receipt of an intent to file a claim, VA will consider the completed claim filed as of the date the intent to file was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a).

The preamble of the current version of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 excludes supplemental claims from the intent-to file-framework. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit invalidated this exclusion.  See Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110, 1147-48 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding that excluding only supplemental claims from the intent-to-file framework is arbitrary and capricious because VA failed to adequately explain its inconsistent treatment of initial and supplemental claims given the substantially similar statutory language in § 5110(a)(1) and § 5110(a)(3)).

Under the AMA system of review, an effective date can be preserved if a claim is continuously pursued.  For a claim to be continuously pursued, a Veteran must submit one of three review options available within one year after a final decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

As discussed above, the Veteran did not submit a notice of disagreement, supplemental claim, higher-level review, or new and relevant evidence within one year of the February 2020 rating decision, which assigned a 20 percent evaluation for the Veteran's degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine with strain effective October 25, 2019.  This decision became final.  Therefore, an earlier effective date for service connection for radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities may not be assigned based upon the continuous pursuit of an increased evaluation for degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine with strain.

The October 2021 claim listed the issues of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus, high blood pressure, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, sleeping conditions, and a TDIU.  The Veteran did not mention his service-connected back disability or service connection for radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities.  Therefore, the Board may not accept the October 2021 claim as a claim of entitlement to service connection for radiculopathy of the bilateral extremities. 

There are no unadjudicated claims of entitlement to service connection for radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities that were received prior to the March 13, 2022, intent to file a claim for compensation.  

Based upon the forgoing, March 13, 2022, is the earliest effective date available under the law for the grants of service connection for radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities.  Effective dates prior to March 13, 2022, for the grants of service connection for radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities are denied.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103A, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.400.

3. Entitlement to an evaluation greater than 40 percent for degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine with strain.

The Veteran seeks an evaluation greater than 40 percent for his degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine with strain.

The Veteran's degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine with strain is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5242.  Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less; or, favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 100 percent evaluation is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  

Any associated objective neurological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, are to be evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code.  Id.  at Note 1.  

Unfavorable ankylosis is defined as "a condition in which the entire cervical spine, the entire thoracolumbar spine, or the entire spine is fixed in flexion or extension, and the ankylosis results in one or more of the following: difficulty walking because of a limited line of vision; restricted opening of the mouth and chewing; breathing limited to diaphragmatic respiration; gastrointestinal symptoms due to pressure of the costal margin on the abdomen; dyspnea or dysphagia; atlantoaxial or cervical subluxation or dislocation; or neurologic symptoms due to nerve root stretching."  Id.  at Note 5.  Additionally, fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) is "always" considered favorable ankylosis.  Id.  

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."  The spine has no opposite joint.

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 40 percent for degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine with strain.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and that there was functional loss due to overuse.  However, even considering the Veteran's lay reports of symptoms and noted functional loss, the degree of additional limitation reflected by the statements would not result in symptoms more nearly approximating unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  The October 2022 VA examiner, after considering the Veteran's statements and examining him, determined that the Veteran would retain limited ranges of motion during flare-ups.  

Consideration has also been given to assigning a rating under the Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome (IVDS) Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  However, the October 2022 VA examiner determined that the Veteran does not have IVDS.  Additionally, the evidence of record is against a finding that the Veteran was ever prescribed bed rest by a physician for a duration that meets the criteria for a higher rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Formula for Rating Intervertebral Disc Syndrome Based on Incapacitating Episodes.  

For the foregoing reasons, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 40 percent for degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine with strain.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating in excess of 40 percent, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

4. Entitlement to an evaluation greater than 40 percent for lumbar radiculopathy of the left lower extremity.

5. Entitlement to an evaluation greater than 40 percent for lumbar radiculopathy of the right lower extremity.

The Veteran seeks evaluations greater than 40 percent for lumbar radiculopathy of the right and left lower extremities.

Paralysis of the sciatic nerve is evaluated in accordance with the criteria set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.  Under these criteria, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 10 percent disabling.  Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent disabling.  Moderately severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 40 percent disabling.  Severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy is rated as 60 percent disabling.  Complete paralysis, with the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost is rated as 80 percent disabling.  38 C.F.R § 4.124a.  

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  The Board notes that "Mild," as relevant to a physical condition, is defined as "not severe" or temperate; with "Temperate" being defined as "keeping or held within limits" and "not extreme or excessive." Merriam-Webster's Dictionary (merriam-webster.com/dictionary, accessed April 1, 2024). "Moderate" is defined as "tending toward the mean or average amount," "not violent, severe, or intense," and "limited in scope or effect." Id. "Severe" is defined as "very painful or harmful" or "of a great degree." Id. The term "severe" is used throughout the rating schedule, including in Diagnostic Code 8520, to indicate a very great degree of the specific listed disability, in order to differentiate between lesser (or sometimes greater) cases of that same disability within the specific diagnostic code. Within the context of Diagnostic Code 8520, which establishes a successive, tiered rating structure, it represents the highest or most extreme level. Certain sections of the Rating Schedule use the term "marked" which the Board equates as similar to "severe."

Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120.  Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves."  The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory.  See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).  

Regarding impairment of motor functions, the Veteran demonstrated active movement against some resistance for the bilateral lower extremities.  There was no evidence of muscle atrophy.

Regarding trophic changes, there was no evidence of trophic changes.

Regarding sensory disturbance, the Veteran exhibited decreased sensation of the bilateral lower extremities.  He endorsed severe numbness and paresthesias and/or dysesthesias.  However, he retained some sensation of the bilateral lower extremities.

Regarding loss of reflexes, upon examination the Veteran had hypoactive reflexes of the bilateral lower extremities.

Regarding pain, the Veteran endorsed severe constant and intermittent pain.

There is no evidence of record that the Veteran experienced complete paralysis of the bilateral lower extremities.  There was no evidence of foot drop or dangle.  The Veteran did not have muscle atrophy.  Upon examination, the Veteran's bilateral lower extremities showed movement against some resistance.  Therefore, the persuasive weight of the evidence is against a finding that the Veteran's lumbar radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities has been manifested by complete paralysis.

Based on the above, the Board finds that the Veteran's lumbar radiculopathy of the bilateral lower extremities is primarily manifest by pain, decreased strength, and sensory disturbances.  The Board also finds that the most probative evidence of record is against a finding that the disabilities are manifest by muscle atrophy.  The Board thus finds that the level of impairment is most analogous to moderately severe incomplete paralysis, which equates to 40 percent evaluations for the Veteran's disabilities.  Diagnostic Code 8520 requires "marked muscular atrophy" for a 60 percent evaluation.  There is no evidence that the Veteran's disabilities have been manifested by muscular atrophy.  Therefore, 60 percent evaluations may not be assigned.

The Board has considered all other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes, but there is no evidence showing the Veteran has neurological impairment associated with any other peripheral nerves that have not already been service-connected.  Therefore, a separate or higher rating under a different Diagnostic Code is not warranted.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claims for evaluations greater than 40 percent for lumbar radiculopathy of the left and right lower extremities.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claims, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 13, 2022, for the grant of TDIU is remanded.

Under the AMA system of review, an effective date can be preserved if a claim is continuously pursued by electing an available review option within one year of the issuance of a final decision.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).  The Veteran contends that he has continuously pursued his claim of entitlement to a TDIU since his initial October 2021 claim.

The Board finds a pre-decisional error of the AOJ in not satisfying a regulatory duty to refer the claim for entitlement to a TDIU to the Director of Compensation Service for extraschedular consideration.  Therefore, remand is required for referral.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b), when there is a reasonable possibility that a claimant is unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities but fails to meet the percentage requirements for eligibility for a total rating set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), such case shall be submitted for extraschedular consideration.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16; Snider v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 1 (2021); Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 66 (2019).

For the period prior to March 13, 2022, the Veteran has a combined rating of 40 percent, which does not meet the schedular criteria.  The case has not previously been referred to the Director of Compensation Service for extraschedular consideration.

The Board finds that there was sufficient evidence of record prior to the AOJ decision on appeal to substantiate a reasonable possibility that the Veteran is unemployable by reason of his service-connected disabilities.  The Veteran reported that he had not worked since January 2007 due to his service-connected disabilities.  See October 2022 VA Form 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability.  As such, the AOJ should have referred the claim for extraschedular consideration.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b); Snider v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 1 (2021); Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 66 (2019); Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1 (2001).

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to March 13, 2022, for the grant of eligibility for DEA is remanded.

Finally, because a decision on the remanded issue of entitlement to an effective date prior to March 13, 2022, for the grant of TDIU could significantly impact a decision on the issue of entitlement to an effective date prior to March 13, 2022, for the grant of eligibility for DEA, the issues are inextricably intertwined.  A remand of the claim for entitlement to an effective date prior to March 13, 2022, for the grant of eligibility for DEA is required.

?

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Refer entitlement to a TDIU to the Director of Compensation Service for Consideration on whether a TDIU on an extraschedular basis is warranted prior to March 13, 2022.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
