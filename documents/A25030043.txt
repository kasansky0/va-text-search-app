FINDINGS OF FACT

In a correspondence dated March 31, 2025, the Veteran's authorized representative withdrew her appeal of the issues of entitlement to service connection for BHL and tinnitus. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for withdrawal of the claim of entitlement to service connection for BHL have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(2), (d)(5); 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for withdrawal of the claim of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(2), (d)(5); 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1979 to September 1982.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2021 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In February 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of her claims for BHL and tinnitus.  In April 2021, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal which denied each claim.

The Veteran submitted a May 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, identifying the April 2021 rating decision and electing the Hearing docket.  However, in March 2025, the Veteran withdrew the hearing request.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id. 

In the present case, the Veteran, through a written correspondence from her authorized representative, received on March 31, 2025, has withdrawn the issues of entitlement to service connection for BHL and tinnitus and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  The Board will therefore consider the issues of entitlement to service connection for BHL, and tinnitus withdrawn.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(b)(2), (d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.
