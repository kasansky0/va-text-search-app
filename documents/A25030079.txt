ORDER

Service connection for sleep apnea is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The current sleep apnea disability is due to the service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for sleep apnea as secondary to PTSD are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1987 to October 1991.

In February 2024, the appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the claim for service connection for sleep apnea, most recently addressed in an April 2023 rating decision.  In June 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

VA received evidence after the AOJ decision on appeal, which the Board could not consider.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

The Board notes that while the period to change AMA dockets per 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) has not elapsed, a docket switch waiver letter (see Williams v. McDonough, 7 Vet. App. 305 (2024)) is not necessary because this decision represents a full grant of the benefits sought on appeal, so there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding to adjudicate the claim.

Service connection for sleep apnea is granted.

The Veteran asserts that he experiences sleep apnea related to his service-connected PTSD.  See February 2024 VA Form 20-0995 (Supplemental Claim Application).  Alternatively, the Veteran asserts that he experiences sleep issues, including insomnia and daytime sleepiness, related to his service-connected tinnitus.  See December 2022 VA Form 21-4138 (Statement).

The Board concludes that secondary service connection for sleep apnea is warranted.  Because the theory of secondary service connection based on service-connected PTSD is dispositive, the Board will not address other theories of service connection.

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Service connection may also be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, the result of, or aggravated by a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.  For disabilities aggravated by a service-connected disability, the Veteran may be compensated for the degree of disability over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b); see Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439, 448 (1995).

As an initial matter, the Board is bound by the favorable findings reached by the AOJ in its rating decision.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b)(4); 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a).  Here, the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran has a current sleep apnea disability, that the Veteran's claimed primary disability of PTSD is service connected, and that the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).

The record contains medical opinions weighing both in favor of and against the claim.

Weighing in favor of the claim, the Veteran submitted a February 2024 private medical opinion stating that the current sleep apnea disability is due to the service-connected PTSD.  The private clinician opined that, while the relationship between PTSD and sleep apnea is not perfectly clear, PTSD symptoms contributed to the development of the Veteran's sleep apnea.  The private clinician based this opinion on a thorough review of the Veteran's entire claims file and cited a reputable source in support of their conclusions.  The Board therefore affords the February 2024 private opinion significant probative weight.

Weighing against the claim, the AOJ obtained a March 2024 VA medical opinion regarding secondary service connection.  The March 2024 VA clinician acknowledged the association between PTSD and sleep apnea but opined that there is no established etiology for sleep apnea due to PTSD and that the Veteran's sleep apnea was more likely due to obesity.  The VA clinician did not explain whether the lack of established etiology for sleep apnea due to PTSD means PTSD cannot cause sleep apnea or consider whether the Veteran's sleep apnea is aggravated by the service-connected PTSD.  Moreover, the VA clinician did not address the prior February 2024 private medical opinion.  The Board therefore affords the March 2024 VA medical opinion regarding secondary causation little probative weight.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence persuasively demonstrates the Veteran's current sleep apnea is due to the service-connected PTSD. Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection for sleep apnea is warranted.
