REMANDED

The appeal for recognition of, K.N., as the Veteran's dependent spouse, to include an appropriate effective date for any such award, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from November 1989 until his honorable discharge in November 1993.

By way of background, in a March 28, 2022, Rating Decision, a Regional Office of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) awarded the Veteran service connection for depressive disorder. It assigned an initial 30 percent disability rating effective September 29, 2021. Prior to September 29, 2021, he was only rated as 20 percent disabled due to a right shoulder disability. 

Any veteran who is entitled to disability compensation, and whose disability is rated not less than 30 percent, is entitled to additional compensation for dependents, including for a spouse and child. 38 U.S.C. § 1115; 38 C.F.R. § 3.4(b)(2).

The Veteran met the threshold rating criteria for dependency benefits as of September 29, 2021. Thus, in the March 29, 2022, Notification Letter, which notified the Veteran of the Rating Decision, the VA Regional Office informed the Veteran as follows:

We are currently paying you as a single Veteran with no dependents.

Your combined evaluation is 30 percent or more disabling; therefore, you may be eligible for additional benefits based on dependency. We may be able to pay you retroactive benefits for your dependents if you submit your dependency claim within a year from the date of this letter. 

The letter also informed the Veteran how to submit a claim for dependency benefits. 

The Veteran did not submit a claim for dependency benefits within a year of the March 29, 2022, Notification Letter. Thus, the VA Regional Office continued to pay him as a single Veteran with no dependents. 

On January 17, 2024, the Veteran submitted VA Form 21-686c (Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents). He listed his spouse, K.N. He indicated they were married since 2004. The VA Regional Office issued an Award on January 17, 2024, adding K.N. as the Veteran's dependent spouse effective payment date of February 1, 2024. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.31 (payment begins first of the following month in which the award became effective). 

The Board received VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) on January 17, 2024, from the Veteran. He elected the Direct Review docket. A January 24, 2024, Board letter informed the Veteran and his representative that his appeal had been formally placed on the Board's Direct Review docket. The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the award of dependency benefits for K.N.

While this appeal was pending, the VA Regional Office removed K.N. from the Veteran's dependency award in a March 13, 2024, Notification Letter. In that letter, the VA Regional Office stated:

We couldn't pay for [K.N.] as a dependent, because not all required elements were met. The following list contains an explanation of the elements required to establish entitlement to additional compensation for your dependent:

You did not provide a history of your previous marriages. (38 [C.F.R. §] 3.205)[.]

To make the matter more complicated, the VA Regional Office appears to have sua sponte amended the effective date for the award of K.N. as a dependent to October 1, 2021. See Award Print (associated with the Veteran's claims file on March 12, 2024). In doing so, it appears to have stated that K.N. was not a dependent since October 1, 2021, which would cover the initial award period of February 1, 2024, to the present.

The appeal before the Board is one for an earlier effective date for the award of dependency benefits for K.N. But, as of right now, K.N. is not a dependent. And the VA Regional Office has effectively removed K.N. as a dependent from October 1, 2021, to the present based on the March 12, 2024, Award Print (as well as subsequent Award Prints). Thus, the Board would need to first establish K.N. is a dependent before addressing any effective date. 

The problem here is that much of the evidence that the VA Regional Office relied on to amend the effective date as well as end the Veteran's dependency award for K.N. was received after the decision on appeal. Because the Veteran has selected to have the Board review his appeal under "Direct Review," the Board's decision is based on a review of the evidence of record at the time of the January 17, 2024, award decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Thus, the Board cannot consider the subsequently submitted evidence of record to make a determination as to whether K.N. should be legally deemed a dependent. 

Given the oddity of the procedural and factual history of this appeal, the Board exercises its discretion and remands this appeal for the VA Regional Office to address the evidence of record and assess whether the K.N. is dependent. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) ("The Board may remand for correction of any other error by the agency of original jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.").  The Board observes that the VA Regional Office has provided evidence of his prior divorce before his marriage to K.N., which the VA Regional Office seemingly requested. See Divorce Decree (received October 25, 2024). Thus, there is a reasonable possibility that the Veteran will receive dependency benefits for K.N. on remand. 

In general, to the extent evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed, such evidence will be considered by the VA Regional Office in the adjudication of the claim on remand.

Accordingly, the matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Readjudicate whether the K.N. is a dependent of the Veteran for purposes of dependency benefits. If so, adjudicate the appropriate effective date. 

2. The VA Regional Office is not prohibited from taking any other actions it deems necessary to develop and adjudicate the Veteran's claim.
