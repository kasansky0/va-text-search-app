ORDER

Service connection for headaches is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran does not have a current medical diagnosis of headaches that is related to service and has not had a headache disability any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for headaches have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant is a Veteran who served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from March 1982 to March 1986.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a February 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  In that decision, inter alia, the RO denied entitlement to service connection for headaches.

In an August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran selected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for headaches

The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to service connection for headaches that began in service after a head injury incurred during a motor vehicle accident in July 1985.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  See 38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a).  To substantiate a claim of service connection there must be evidence of: (1) a current disability (for which service connection is sought); (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a nexus between the claimed disability and the disease or injury in service.  See Shedden v, Principi, 381 F.3d 1153, 1166-1167?(Fed. Cir. 2004).   

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d). 

Presumptive service connection may be established for certain chronic diseases manifesting themselves to a certain degree within a certain time after service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309(a).  

Service connection for a recognized chronic disease can also be established through continuity of symptomatology.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (2013); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309.  Migraine headaches are considered an organic disease of the nervous system and is therefore considered a chronic disease for VA purposes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Service connection based on continuity of symptomatology is therefore applicable in this case.  Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 271-72 (2015). 

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current headache disability, or symptoms thereof, that onset in service and has continued since service.  

When the Veteran filed his claim for service connection for headaches (and other unrelated disabilities), he did not furnish any evidence or argument of complaints, clinical findings, or diagnosis of headaches.  The Veteran referred only to service treatment records as evidence that he experienced some instances of headaches while on active duty.  However, there is no evidence that headache symptoms were chronic in service, and there is no post-service medical evidence to corroborate the presence of headaches or symptoms thereof after service.  The Veteran did not endorse headaches on his discharge examination.

There are scant VA treatment records on file, and they do not reveal evidence of complaints or treatment of headaches.   The Veteran did not submit any lay statements in support of his claim for headaches.  He did not assert that he had received any treatment for headaches.  

The Veteran underwent VA examination in February 2024 for an evaluation of residuals of a TBI in conjunction with an unrelated claim for service connection for a TBI.  The examiner found there were no subjective symptoms of TBI or residuals of a TBI, including headaches.  The examiner concluded there was no diagnosis of TBI.

The Veteran was not afforded a VA examination with respect to his claim for entitlement to service connection for headaches.  To comply with VA's duty to assist, the AOJ must provide an examination when the record: (1) contains competent evidence of a current disability, (2) indicates that the signs and symptoms of the disability may be associated with active service, and (3) does not contain sufficient information to decide the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A; McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  In this case, the Veteran is competent to report that he hit his head during a motor vehicle accident, and he is competent to report experiencing occasional headaches in service, and there is no reason to doubt the Veteran's credibility in this regard.  However, neither the Veteran nor his representative provided any statements or assertions of a current headache disability prior to the AOJ decision on appeal, outside of filing a claim for service connection for the disability. However, without competent evidence otherwise of a current disability, an examination under McLendon was not warranted.  

Symptoms of headaches without a diagnosis may constitute a disability, but only if it reaches a level of functional impairment of earning capacity.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1367-69 (Fed. Cir. 2018); Wait v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 8 (2020).  However, the Veteran did not persuasively point to any specific evidence indicating his reported symptoms affected functional impairment of his earning capacity, as he has not provided any information outside of filing a claim.

Based on review of the evidence, the Veteran does not have a current medical diagnosis of headaches that is related to service and has not had a headache disability at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim in December 2023.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claims for service connection for headaches, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
