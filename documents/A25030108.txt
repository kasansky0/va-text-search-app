ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. There is at least an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence as to whether the Veteran's tinnitus is related to active-duty service.

2. The evidence is persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's right knee disability is related to active-duty service.

3. There is clear and unmistakable evidence to show the Veteran had a left knee disability prior to service.

4. The Veteran's preexisting left knee disability clearly and unmistakably was not aggravated beyond its natural progression by service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303(b), 3.307, 3.309(a).

2. The criteria for service connection for a right knee disability, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1131, 5103(a), 5103A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

3. The criteria for service connection for a left knee disability, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1131, 5103(a), 5103A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in active-duty service with the Army from October 2019 to January 2020.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

Procedurally, the Veteran requested a Higher Level Review (HLR) of a February 2024 rating decision; a March 2024 rating decision was issued, and the Veteran submitted a March 2024 10182 form selecting the Direct Review option.

Under the AMA, when a claimant seeks appellate review through the Board's direct docket, the Board may consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 131 Stat. 1114, 38 U.S.C. § 7113 (b). However, the March 2024 rating decision is the response to a higher-level review request of the February 2024 rating decision; therefore, the evidentiary period closed at the February 2024 rating decision. As such, the Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the February 2024 rating decision.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed. Therefore, the Board may not consider this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board next notes that during the pendency of the appeal favorable findings were made to include finding the Veteran had a current diagnosis for tinnitus, and an inservice event relating to the Veteran's left knee. As such, the Board is bound by the favorable findings. AMA, Pub. L. No. 115-55, § 5104A, 131 Stat. 1105, 1106-07.

Service Connection

Service connection is granted on a direct basis when there is competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a), (d).

Service connection for chronic diseases listed in 38 U.S.C. sections 1101 (3) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), may be established on a presumptive basis if the chronic disease was shown as chronic in service; manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period, usually one year, after separation from service; or was noted in service with continuity of symptomatology since service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303 (b), 3.307, 3.309(a).

When evaluating the evidence and rendering a decision on the merits, the Board is required to assess the credibility and probative value of proffered evidence in the context of the record as a whole. See Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 22, 26 (1998). When a claimant seeks benefits and the evidence is in relative equipoise, the claimant prevails.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  The evidence must be persuasively against the claim for benefits to be denied.  See Alemany v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 518 (1996).

Tinnitus

As noted above, favorable findings were made to show the Veteran has a currently diagnosed tinnitus disability.

Review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not show any complaints, treatments, or diagnoses relating to tinnitus.

In a September 2023 claim, the Veteran claimed ringing in the ears from firing rifles during service.

In a November 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported the onset of tinnitus during service or "just after service"; the Veteran described his tinnitus that comes and goes but "shows up every day" for a period of time.

The Veteran reported exposure to noise during service where following treatment for his knee he went to his unit at the firing range and the Veteran was present at the firing range without hearing protection while the members of his unit were firing to include "grenades, explosive, flashbangs, and all types of explosives like that during basic training."

The examiner did not find the Veteran's tinnitus to be related to service. The examiner conceded the Veteran was exposed to excessive noise exposure during active duty; however, the examiner found no complaints of tinnitus in the Veteran's STRs or at separation and therefore was unable to find a nexus.

The examiner further added that based on the Veteran's medical history, clinical findings, and reported onset and duration of tinnitus, they were unable to determine the etiology of tinnitus without resorting to mere speculation.

Although the Veteran's STRs do not show any complaints or treatment for tinnitus, the Board finds the Veteran is competent to report that he experienced symptoms of tinnitus during this period. The Veteran's statements are credible and entitled to probative weight, as they are internally consistent and consistent with other evidence of record, which shows that these symptoms combined with his duties and experiences in service were attributable to the Veteran's current tinnitus.

Furthermore, the absence of in-service evidence of a hearing disability during service (i.e., one meeting the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 ) is not always fatal to a service connection claim. See Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992). 

Evidence of a current hearing loss disability as well as a medically sound basis for attributing that disability to service may serve as a basis for a grant of service connection where there is credible evidence of acoustic trauma due to significant noise exposure in service, post-service audiometric findings meeting the regulatory requirements for hearing loss disability for VA purposes, and a medically sound basis upon which to attribute the post-service findings to the injury in service (as opposed to intercurrent causes). See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 159 (1993).

Although the November 2023 VA examiner gave a negative etiology opinion, the examiner did not address the Veteran's statements regarding exposure to noise from his unit at the firing range in relation to his claimed tinnitus. As such, the Board finds there is sufficient evidence to support a link between the Veteran's diagnosed tinnitus with the Veteran's acoustic trauma in service, despite the November 2023VA examiner's findings.

As such, in light of the Veteran's acoustic trauma in service, the current diagnosis of tinnitus, and the Veteran's credible statements reporting symptoms occurring during service, the Board finds the evidence is at least in equipoise. As such, the benefit of the doubt is resolved in the Veteran's favor and service connection for tinnitus is warranted.

Right knee disability

In a March 2022 provider visit, the provider diagnosed the Veteran with bilateral patellar instability. The Board resolves reasonable doubt to find the Veteran with a current disability.

Review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) does not show any complaints, treatments, or diagnoses relating to the right knee.

At the March 2022 provider visit, the Veteran reported that after joining the service in 2019, he "blew his knee out" and recently dislocated his right knee in February 2022. The Board notes that the Veteran's STRs show only a November 2019 treatment only for the left knee.

In February 2024 it was documented that the Veteran failed to report for a scheduled VA examination relating to the Veteran's claimed right knee disability.

When entitlement to a benefit cannot be established without a current VA examination or reexamination, and a claimant fails to report for a scheduled medical examination without good cause, an original compensation claim shall be rated based upon the evidence of record. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655. VA must consider both (1) whether the examination was necessary to establish entitlement to the benefit sought and (2) whether the claimant lacked good cause to miss the scheduled examination. Turk v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 565, 569 (2008); Kowalski v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 171, 177 (2005). 

Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, the illness or hospitalization of the claimant, the death of an immediate family member, etc. 38 C.F.R. § 3.655 (a).

In the March 2024 HLR submission, the Veteran stated that they did not attend the VA examination due to an "emergency"; however, no further information was provided to clarify what the emergency was, and the Veteran did not attempt to reschedule the examination prior to the decision of the AOJ.  

As addressed above, the Veteran's appeal stems from a Higher-Level Review of a February 2024 rating decision. 

Under AMA, Higher Level Reviews are limited to the evidence of record at the time of the rating decision the Veteran requested a Higher-Level Review of, which in this case was February 21, 2024. 

The Board next notes that under the AMA, when a claimant seeks appellate review through the Board's Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 7113 (a). Although the Veteran appealed the March 2024 rating decision based on the Veteran's March 2024 HLR of the February 2024 rating decision, the evidentiary record under review by the Board closed with the February 2024 rating decision.

Review of the record prior to the February 2024 rating decision does not show the Veteran reported or provided any statements reporting an emergency or event that prevented him from attending scheduled VA examinations.

Furthermore, as the report of missing scheduled VA examinations due to an emergency was not associated with the record until after the evidentiary record at the February 2024 rating decision was closed, it cannot serve as a basis as a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

Since the Veteran failed to respond to VA requests to attend or rescheduled examinations and did not provide adequate information to demonstrate good cause for doing so prior to the rating decision on appeal, the service-connection claims shall be decided based on the evidence of record. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.655 (b).

After review of the record, the Board finds the evidence is persuasively against a finding of service connection for a right knee disability.

Review of the record does not show any diagnosis or complaints of a right knee disability to a compensable degree within one year of the Veteran's separation from service. The Veteran has not provided any statements indicating or describing symptoms relating to a right knee disability to demonstrate continuity of symptoms during service.

While the Veteran in March 2022 reported blowing out his right knee in service, the Veteran's STRs are silent relating to any complaints, treatments, or diagnoses relating to a right knee disability. The March 2022 diagnosis for bilateral patellar instability is more than a year after the Veteran's separation from service in January 2020.

The Board acknowledges that a layperson is competent to testify in regard to the onset and continuity of symptomatology. Heuer v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 379, 384 (1995); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 403 (1995); Caldwell v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 466 (1991). Furthermore, lay witnesses may, in some circumstances, opine on questions of diagnosis and etiology. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (finding that the Board's categorical statement that "a valid medical opinion" was required to establish nexus, and that a layperson was "not competent" to provide testimony as to nexus because she was a layperson, conflicts with Jandreau).

Nevertheless, a lay person, the Veteran does not have the training or expertise to render a competent opinion which is more probative than the VA examiner's opinion on this issue, as this is a medical determination that is complex. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-71 (1994)).

Review of the record does not show any objective medical opinion to support the Veteran's claim that his right knee disability was related to service; as addressed above, the Veteran did not appear for a February 2024 VA examination that would have provided an opinion on the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed issue and did not reschedule or demonstrate good cause for not appearing.

Therefore, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against a finding of service connection for the Veteran's right knee disability. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. However, as the evidence weighs against the claim, that doctrine is not applicable. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102 ; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 54-56 (1990).

Left knee disability

As noted above, in a March 2022 provider visit, the provider diagnosed the Veteran with bilateral patellar instability and chronic pain in the left knee. As such, the Board finds the Veteran with a current disability.

The Board notes the favorable finding that an inservice event occurred relating to the Veteran's left knee. A November 2019 record shows the Veteran was seen for a left knee lateral patellar subluxation that occurred during a training exercise; the Veteran also reported a history of patella dislocation before entering service.

The Veteran's STRs show the September 2019 enlistment examination did not show any documentation of knee issues. 

The Veteran submitted an April 2014 hospital record documenting the Veteran was treated for left knee pain and swelling after it had "went out"; the Veteran also reported similar issues in the past and x-ray tests showed moderate joint effusion.

The Board notes that a Veteran is presumed in sound condition except for defects noted when examined and accepted for service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (b)(1). Clear and unmistakable evidence that the disability existed prior to service and was not aggravated by service will rebut the presumption of soundness. Once the presumption of soundness has attached, VA holds the burden of proving by clear and unmistakable evidence that both: (1) the Veteran's disease or injury preexisted service, and (2) that the disease or injury was not aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1111. A lack of aggravation may be shown by establishing that there was no increase in disability during service or that any increase in disability was due to the natural progress of the preexisting condition. Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 U.S.C. § 1153.

The clear-and-unmistakable-evidence standard is an "onerous" and "very demanding" evidentiary standard, requiring that the evidence be "undebatable." Cotant v. West, 17 Vet. App. 11 (2003) (citing Laposky v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 331 (1993)).

In cases where the disease or injury at issue is not noted on the entrance examination, a two-pronged test is for consideration in determining whether the presumption of soundness has been rebutted. First, VA must show by clear and unmistakable evidence that the disease or injury existed prior to service. Second, VA must show by clear and unmistakable evidence that the preexisting disease or injury was not aggravated by service. VAOPGCPREC 3-2003 (July 16, 2003). See Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

A preexisting disease or injury will be found to have been aggravated by service only if the evidence shows that the underlying disability underwent an increase in severity; the occurrence of symptoms, in the absence of an increase in the underlying severity, does not constitute aggravation of the disability. Davis v. Principi, 276 F.3d 1341, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2002); 38 C.F.R. § 3.306 (a). 

Evidence of the Veteran being asymptomatic on entry into service, with an exacerbation of symptoms during service, does not constitute evidence of aggravation. Green v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 320, 323 (1991). If the disorder becomes worse during service and then improves due to in-service treatment to the point that it was no more disabling than it was at entrance into service, the disorder has not been aggravated by service. Verdon v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 529 (1996).

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has distinguished between those cases in which the preexisting condition is noted upon entry into service, and those cases in which the preexistence of the condition must otherwise be established. See Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2004); Davis v. Principi, 276 F.3d 1341, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2002); Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 234 (2012); see also 38 U.S.C. § 1111 (presumption of sound condition).

In a case where there is no preexisting condition noted upon entry into service, a veteran is presumed to have entered service in sound condition, and the burden falls to the government to demonstrate by clear and unmistakable evidence that (1) the condition preexisted service and (2) the preexisting condition was not aggravated by service. Horn, 25 Vet. App. at 234. The government may show a lack of aggravation by establishing by clear and unmistakable evidence "that there was no increase in disability during service or that any 'increase in disability [was] due to the natural progress of the' preexisting condition." Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096 ; see also, 38 U.S.C. § 1153 ; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306. This burden of proof must be met by "affirmative evidence" demonstrating that there was no aggravation. The burden is not met by finding "that the record contains insufficient evidence of aggravation." Horn, 25 Vet. App. at 236-37.

"Clear and unmistakable evidence" is an "onerous" evidentiary standard, requiring that the preexistence of a condition and the no-aggravation result be "undebatable." Quirin v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 390, 396 (2009) (noting that clear and undebatable means that the evidence cannot be misinterpreted or misunderstood). 

In this case, the record clearly and unmistakably shows that a left knee disability pre-existed the Veteran's military service. As noted above, while the September 2019 enlistment examination did not find any knee issues, an April 2014 hospital record documents the Veteran receiving treatment relating to a left knee disability prior to the Veteran's enlistment examination.

As such, the Board finds that a left knee disability preexisted military service. The question turns to whether there is clear and unmistakable evidence that it was not aggravated by his service.

Following the Veteran's initial November 2019 treatment, followup visits showed the Veteran received physical therapy but continued to report pain. At the December 2019 separation examination, the Veteran reported left patellar instability starting from age 14.

The Board notes that temporary or intermittent flare-ups during service of a pre-existing injury or disease are not sufficient to be considered" aggravation in service" unless the underlying condition, as contrasted to symptoms, is worsened. Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 297 (1991). The occurrence of symptoms, in the absence of an increase in the underlying severity, does not constitute aggravation of the disability. Davis v. Principi, 276 F.3d 1341, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Evidence of the Veteran being asymptomatic on entry into service, with an exacerbation of symptoms during service, does not constitute evidence of aggravation. Green v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 320, 323 (1991). If the disorder becomes worse during service and then improves due to in-service treatment to the point that it was no more disabling than it was at entrance into service, the disorder has not been aggravated by service. Verdon v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 529 (1996).

In the September 2023 claim, the Veteran reported that he dislocated his knee when he was 10; the Veteran added that since his separation from service he has had multiple dislocations of the knees.

In February 2024 the Veteran did not appear for a scheduled VA examination relating to his left knee. As addressed above, while the Veteran in March 2024 reported an emergency as a reason for missing the examination, this statement was made after the evidentiary record closed with the February 2024 rating decision; and the Veteran did not provide any further information to demonstrate good cause or attempt to reschedule the examination prior to the February 2024 rating decision. See Turk v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 565, 569 (2008); Kowalski v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 171, 177 (2005), 38 C.F.R. § 3.655 (a).

The Board acknowledges that a layperson is competent to testify in regard to the onset and continuity of symptomatology. Heuer v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 379, 384 (1995); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 403 (1995); Caldwell v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 466 (1991). Furthermore, lay witnesses may, in some circumstances, opine on questions of diagnosis and etiology. See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (finding that the Board's categorical statement that "a valid medical opinion" was required to establish nexus, and that a layperson was "not competent" to provide testimony as to nexus because she was a layperson, conflicts with Jandreau).

Nevertheless, a lay person, the Veteran does not have the training or expertise to render a competent opinion which is more probative than a VA examiner's opinion on this issue, as this is a medical determination that is complex. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-71 (1994)).

There is no medical evidence of record from the Veteran's time in service or immediately thereafter suggesting that there was a permanent increase in the Veteran's left knee beyond the natural progression of the disease during his active-duty service.

Review of the record does not show any objective medical opinion to support the Veteran's claim that his left knee disability was aggravated by service; addressed above, the Veteran did not appear for a February 2024 VA examination that would have provided an opinion on the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed issue and did not reschedule or demonstrate good cause for not appearing. The Veteran has not provided any other objective medical opinion in support the claim.

Therefore, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against a finding of service connection for the Veteran's left knee disability. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. However, as the evidence weighs against the claim, that doctrine is not applicable. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102 ; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 54-56 (1990).

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
