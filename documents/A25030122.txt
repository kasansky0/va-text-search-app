ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is granted.  

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's sleep apnea began during active service.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for establishing entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

Preliminary Matters

The Veteran had honorable active-duty service with the United States Army from August 2007 to March 2018.  The Veteran served in the Southwest Asia Theater of Operations.  

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 21, 2024, rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

On July 23, 2024, the Veteran filed VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), appealing the July 21, 2024, rating decision.  The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  He acknowledged that Direct Review would entail the Board reviewing the evidence of record at the time of the prior decision, with no evidence submission or hearing requests.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  

The Board notes the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305.  In Williams v. McDonough, the Court held the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  In the present case, the rating decision on appeal was issued on July 23, 2024.  Thus, the one-year period following the decision has not yet elapsed.  However, the decision below represents a complete grant of the benefit sought.  Accordingly, there is no prejudice with the Board adjudicating the claim prior to the expiration of the one-year period, and delaying adjudication would needlessly delay the award of benefits to the Veteran with no potential benefit.  Thus, the Board will proceed to adjudicate the claim.  

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  Generally, to establish service connection, a veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service."  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  

In addition, for certain chronic diseases, such as arthritis, a presumption of service connection arises if the chronic disease was shown as chronic in service; manifested to a compensable degree within one year following discharge from service; or was noted in service with continuity of symptomatology since service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1131, 1133, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, 3.309(a); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the veteran.  See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994).  Board determinations with respect to the weight and credibility of evidence are factual determinations going to the probative value of the evidence. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).  Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; not every item of evidence has the same probative value.  

Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.  Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while credibility is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted.  Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 465.  Lay statements may serve to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159; see Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  

When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with a veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence weighs persuasively against a claim, in which case, the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is granted.  

The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea.  The Veteran has stated that he first began experiencing symptoms of this condition during active service, specifically during his deployment in Afghanistan.  Alternatively, he has also stated the possibility of his sleep disorder being secondary to his service-connected disabilities.  See June 2023 Higher-Level Review (HLR) Informal Conference Worksheet.  As the Board is granting the claim on a direct service connection basis, further discussion of the secondary theory of service connection is unnecessary.  

Initially, the Board notes that the Veteran's service treatment records do not reflect that the Veteran had any problems related to a sleep disorder upon entry into active service.  

Favorable findings from the July 2024 rating decision on appeal include a current diagnosis of sleep apnea.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Thus, the first element of service connection has been met.  

Second, there is evidence of an in-service event, disease, or injury.  In that regard, the Veteran has consistently stated that his symptoms began in service.  As previously stated, the Veteran's service treatment records do not reflect that he had any problems related to a sleep disorder upon entry into active service.  In his initial claim, the Veteran indicated that, upon his return from Afghanistan, he started to sleep more and more on a couch instead of in his marital bed, presumably to not disturb his spouse at the time.  See October 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ.  Eventually, he only slept on the couch.  See id.  Furthermore, on VA examination in November 2022, the Veteran reported that he developed an abrupt onset of difficulty breathing, falling asleep, and the need to sleep in certain positions with the fan on.  He further reported that he would wake up gasping.  He indicated that, since 2015, he has been sleeping on the couch instead of the bed.  Finally, during a June 2023 HLR Informal Conference, the Veteran stated that he began to experience symptoms in 2014 after returning from his deployment.  Here, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements regarding the in-service onset of his claimed disability to be competent and credible, as he has been consistent with his assertions throughout the appeal period.  See Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372, at 1377; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a).  The Board affords the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran and finds that his sleep apnea symptoms began in service.  There is nothing to explicitly contradict the Veteran's consistent reports; thus, they are credible?and?competent.?  Thus, the second element of service connection has also been met.  

Lastly, turning to the nexus prong, the Board acknowledges the negative evidence of record.  The record includes a January 2023 VA opinion, in which the examiner concluded that there was no evidence for obstructive sleep apnea or a sleep-related breathing disorder during service or within one year from separation.  The Board finds this opinion to be inadequate, as the examiner relied on the absence of evidence.  Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337?(holding lay evidence concerning?continuity?of symptoms?after service, if credible, is ultimately competent, regardless of the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence).?  The Board also notes that the January 2023 examiner seems to have discounted the Veteran's competent and credible reports of symptoms since service.  

To the extent that the grant of service connection in this matter is based primarily on lay evidence, "nothing in the regulatory or statutory provisions [relating to evidence to be considered] require both medical and competent lay evidence; rather, they make clear that competent lay evidence can be sufficient in and of itself."?  Buchanan, 451 F.3d at 1335.  

Moreover, the record reflects that the Veteran's sleep apnea did not exist prior to service.  In addition, the competent and credible statements, as discussed above, show that the Veteran's sleep disorder began during active service and continued post-service.  As noted in the preceding paragraph, the Veteran is certainly competent to attest to symptomatology such as difficulty breathing and gasping.  

Although a remand for further medical opinion could be accomplished, the Board will not remand for negative evidence.  The Board finds that the approximate balance of the evidence is for the claim.  Accordingly, after resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that service connection for sleep apnea is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  

The Board notes that the Veteran has also claimed service connection for sleep apnea on a secondary basis; however, as the issue is being granted on a direct basis, service connection on a secondary basis is moot.
