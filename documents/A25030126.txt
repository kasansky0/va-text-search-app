REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 1960 to April 1962.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a May 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). The appeal is being reviewed under the modernized review system, commonly referred to as the "AMA," as established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017. 115 Pub. L. No. 55, 131 Stat. 1105.

The May 2024 rating decision found that the Veteran had not submitted new and relevant evidence with his June 2023 supplemental claim but nevertheless substantively decided the claims, so the Board need not address whether new and relevant evidence has been received. 

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 rating decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Generally, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service, and; (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

There are separate requirements for establishing service connection for PTSD. Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125 (a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f); 38 C.F.R. § 4.125 (requiring PTSD diagnoses to conform to the DSM-IV/V). Typically, a Veteran's lay statements alone cannot establish the occurrence of a stressor unless the PTSD claim is based on an exception enumerated in the regulation.

If a PTSD claim is based on an in-service personal assault (including MST), evidence from sources other than the veteran's records may corroborate the veteran's account of the stressor incident. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f)(5). Examples of such evidence include but are not limited to: records from law enforcement authorities, rape crisis centers, mental health counseling centers, hospitals, or physicians; pregnancy tests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases; and statements from family members, roommates, fellow service members, or clergy. Evidence of behavior changes following the claimed assault is one type of relevant evidence that may be found in these sources. Examples of behavior changes that may constitute credible evidence of the stressor include but are not limited to: a request for a transfer to another military duty assignment; deterioration in work performance; substance abuse; episodes of depression, panic attacks, or anxiety without an identifiable cause; or unexplained economic or social behavior changes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f)(5). This type of indirect evidence of an in-service assault tends to prove that the assault occurred by corroborating details of the Veteran's account of the events that transpired as a result of that attack. See Molitor v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 397, 409 (2017) (explaining that records that corroborate details of a personal assault tend to reinforce and confirm a claimant's description of the assault).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Service connection for PTSD.

The Veteran seeks service connection for PTSD, asserting that his PTSD is related to an in-service personal assault. See July 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ; July 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ; August 2022 VA Form 20-0995; June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; December 2024 VA Form 10182. 

The Veteran described experiencing discrimination during service, including a racially-motivated personal assault by the Veteran's fellow service members that occurred while the Veteran was stationed in Germany in 1961. See July 2021 VA Form 21-0781a; February 2024 VA Form 21-0781a. The Veteran chose not to report the assault, as he did not want "to go through the process of fear, blame, and retaliation by the perpetrators." Id. In adjudicating a claim, the Board must fully assess the competence and credibility of the Veteran. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1335 (2006); Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362 (2005). Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). The Veteran is competent to report the in-service discrimination and personal assault he experienced. The Veteran's statements are consistent with the other evidence, including the December 2023 VA examination, which found the in-service personal assault described by the Veteran was the stressor responsible for the Veteran's PTSD diagnosis. See December 2023 VA Examination. The Veteran's competent statements are therefore credible and constitute probative evidence.

For personal assault PTSD claims, medical opinion evidence may be submitted for use in determining whether the occurrence of a stressor is corroborated. Mengassi v. Shinseki, 638 F.3d 1379, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2011); Patton v. West, 12 Vet. App. 272 (1999) (rejecting the requirement that "something more than medical nexus evidence is required for 'credible supporting evidence'" in personal-assault cases); see also 67 Fed. Reg. 10,330, 10,331 (Mar. 7, 2002) ("If, however, VA finds that a doctor's diagnosis of PTSD due to a personal assault is... 'competent and credible' and there is no evidence to the contrary in the record, in all likelihood, such an opinion would constitute competent medical evidence."). The December 2023 VA examiner diagnosed PTSD and identified the Veteran's described in-service personal assault as the stressor linked to the Veteran's PTSD diagnosis. See December 2023 VA Examination. Therefore, the Veteran's competent and credible lay statements constitute highly probative evidence weighing in favor of the Veteran's claim.

Service treatment records (STRs) do not document treatment or diagnoses related to PTSD. See STRs received August 2021. The Veteran denied experiencing frequent trouble sleeping, frequent or terrifying nightmares, depression or excessive worry, loss of memory or amnesia, bed wetting, nervous trouble of any sort, any drugs or narcotic habit, and excessive drinking habit. Id. However, the absence of in-service reports or treatment cannot be considered "negative evidence" in personal assault cases. See AZ v. Shinseki, 731 F.3d 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (purpose of Federal Rule of Evidence 803 does not apply because most people do not report personal assaults). Therefore, STRs do not weigh in favor of or against the Veteran's claim. 

VA treatment records show the Veteran experienced symptoms of PTSD. See June 2023 VAMC Other Output/Reports; CAPRI received September 2023. A March 2023 primary care visit reflects that the Veteran reported feeling depressed and having thoughts of suicide. See June 2023 VAMC Other Output/Reports. Mental health notes from May 2023 and June 2023 indicate the Veteran was provisionally diagnosed with mild depression but reported symptoms of PTSD including irritability, short temper, excessive worry, thoughts about death, depression and low mood, and social isolation. See CAPRI received September 2023. Although the Veteran was tentatively diagnosed with depression, the diagnosis was "provisional," and VA treatment records are otherwise consistent with the other probative evidence of record, including the December 2023 VA examination and the Veteran's lay statements, which describe the symptoms of PTSD. Id. Therefore, VA treatment records constitute probative evidence weighing in favor of the Veteran's claim. 

The December 2023 VA examiner found the Veteran experienced depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks that occur weekly or less often, mild memory loss such as forgetting names directions or recent events, flattened affect, and disturbances of motivation and mood. See December 2023 VA Examination. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD, opining that the in-service personal assault that the Veteran experienced while stationed in Germany in 1961 is the stressor responsible for the Veteran's diagnosis. Id. In support of their findings, the examiner reviewed and cited the Veteran's lay statements, STRs, and VA treatment records. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302-304 (2008). The opinion is consistent with the other probative evidence of record showing that the Veteran experiences PTSD as a result of an in-service personal assault. Therefore, the December 2023 VA examiner's opinion constitutes highly probative evidence weighing in favor of the Veteran's claim. 

The April 2024 VA examiner found the Veteran experiences depressed mood, anxiety, panic attacks occurring weekly or less, chronic sleep impairment, and mild memory loss. See April 2024 VA Examination. The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with mild, recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD) with anxious distress, and opined that the Veteran's diagnosis is less likely than not related to service, emphasizing the absence of documentation for psychiatric complaints in the STRs, including the Veteran's denial of frequent trouble sleeping, nervous trouble, depression, or excessive worry, when he separated from service. Id.; see also STRs received August 2021. The opinion's rationale is based on the absence of psychiatric complaints in the STRs without consideration of the Veteran's lay statements describing his in-service stressor and his symptoms. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 40 (2007). The opinion also fails to discuss the December 2023 VA examination and opinion, so the rationale has not provided an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions. See Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007). Therefore, the April 2024 VA examination and opinion is afforded minimal probative weight.

In sum, the probative evidence weighs in favor of the claim, as the claims file reflects medical evidence diagnosing the Veteran with PTSD and linking the current symptoms to the in-service personal assault stressor event described by the Veteran, and there is credible medical evidence supporting the Veteran's lay statements that the claimed in-service stressor occurred. Accordingly, service connection for PTSD based on an in-service personal assault is warranted. 

2. Service connection for anxiety.

3. Service connection for depression.

The Veteran seeks service connection for anxiety and depression, asserting that his anxiety and depression are related to service or developed secondary to service-connected disabilities. See July 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ; August 2022 VA Form 20-0995; June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ; June 2023 VA Form 20-0995; December 2024 VA Form 10182. However, the probative evidence does not reveal a diagnosis of anxiety or depression. 

VA treatment records document mild, recurrent MDD with anxious distress but note that the diagnosis of MDD was "provisional." See CAPRI received September 2023; June 2023 VAMC Other Output/Reports. VA treatment records otherwise document symptoms that are consistent with the Veteran's lay statements and the December 2023 VA examination, diagnosis, and opinion indicating the Veteran experiences PTSD, not anxiety or depression. Id. Thus, VA treatment records weigh against the claims for service connection for anxiety and depression. 

The December 2023 VA examiner did not diagnose the Veteran with anxiety or depression, explaining that the Veteran's PTSD diagnosis subsumes the anxiety and depression diagnoses. See December 2023 VA Examination. The opinion is adequate, because the rationale is based on an in-person examination and review of the Veteran's records and cites to the Veteran's probative lay statements. The opinion is also consistent with the other probative evidence. Consequently, the December 2023 VA examination constitutes highly probative evidence weighing against the claims for service connection for anxiety and depression. 

The April 2024 VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with MDD and opined that the Veteran's symptoms did not meet the criteria for a PTSD diagnosis. However, as discussed above, the opinion relied on the absence of psychiatric complaints in the Veteran's STRs, and the rationale did not address the Veteran's competent and credible lay statements. See April 2024 VA Examination; August 2021 STRs. The examiner did not discuss the prior December 2023 VA examination and medical opinion, so the opinion did not provide a rationale that can be considered and weighed against contrary opinions. Therefore, the April 2024 VA examiner's diagnosis of MDD is not probative. 

Thus, the probative evidence weighs persuasively against the claims for service connection for anxiety and depression. Accordingly, service connection for anxiety and service connection for depression are denied.
