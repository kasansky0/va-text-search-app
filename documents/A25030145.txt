DOCKET NO. 240731-469548
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for basal cell skin cancer, to include as due to herbicide exposure, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's basal cell skin cancer was not shown as chronic in service and did not manifest to a compensable degree within the applicable presumptive period; continuity of symptomatology is not established; and the disability is not otherwise etiologically related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for basal cell skin cancer have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.303.

.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from December 1966 to December 1970.  The Veteran had service in the Republic of Vietnam.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in January 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for basal cell skin cancer, to include as due to herbicide exposure

The Veteran contends that he has basal cell skin cancer resulting from exposure to herbicides during his active military service. 

Historically, in a November 2015 rating decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim of service connection for basal cell skin cancer.  In particular, the AOJ determined that the Veteran did not provide new and material evidence sufficient to re-open the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for basal cell skin cancer, so the claim was not reopened.  The Veteran did not appeal this decision, and no new and relevant evidence was received within one year of the decision.  The November 2015 rating decision is final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c) (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.104, 20.302, 20.1103 (2015).

The Board also declined to reopen a claim for entitlement for a skin condition (cancer) in May 2022. This decision was also not appealed and the decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(b) (2018); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100 (2019). 

In the March 2024 rating decision, the AOJ implicitly found that new and relevant evidence had been received to readjudicate the claim of entitlement to entitlement to service connection for basal cell skin cancer and denied the claim on the merits.  This is a favorable finding by the AOJ, and the Board will proceed to the address the claim on the merits.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

As a preliminary matter, the Veteran currently has a diagnosis of basal cell skin cancer. See March 2024 VA Examination. 

A veteran, who, during active military service, served in the Republic of Vietnam during the period beginning in January 1962 and ending in May 1975, is presumed to have been exposed to herbicide agents, including Agent Orange. 38 U.S.C. § 1116 (f); 38 C.F.R. § 3.307 (a)(6)(iii). Service "in the Republic of Vietnam" includes service both on the landmass of Vietnam and the waters that are no more than 12 miles offshore of Vietnam. 38 U.S.C. § 1116A (a).  The Veteran's military personnel records reflect that he had service in the Republic of Vietnam from November 1967 to November 1968, during the relevant period of time.  As such, herbicide exposure is presumed. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307 (a)(6)(iii).

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). To establish entitlement to service-connected compensation benefits, a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service-the so-called "nexus" requirement." Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).

VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (a). Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

As basal cell skin cancer is not among the diseases set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (e), a presumption based on in-service herbicide exposure is not warranted; however, whether there is evidence of actual direct causation of the Veteran's skin cancer due to herbicide exposure will be considered. See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043-44 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

Turning to the record, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) are silent as to any diagnosis or treatment for any skin disorders during active service.  A Report of Medical Examination from October 1966 at the time of enlistment reveals a normal clinical evaluation of the skin.  Likewise, a Report of Medical Examination from July 1970 at the time of separation reveals a normal clinical evaluation of the skin. 

VA treatment records reveal that the Veteran has a reported history of basal cell skin carcinoma with a diagnosis date of July 2013.  However, these records are limited to reports of medical history that do not provide any indication as to the etiology of the claimed basal cell skin cancer during these visits.

Private treatment records received by VA in September 2015 reveal that the Veteran has had a significant history of basal cell skin cancer from 2006 to 2010, having had multiple procedures related to the removal of the basal cell skin cancer. Similarly, private treatment records received by VA in September 2023 reveal that the Veteran continued to have a diagnosis of basal cell skin cancer and that he received numerous treatments for it for the period between 2012 and 2023.  However, these records are limited to medical reports of the treatments received and do not provide any indication as to the etiology of the claimed basal cells skin cancer during these visits.  

In February 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination.  A diagnosis of basal cell skin cancer was confirmed.  At the time of the examination, the Veteran reported a long history of treatment for skin cancer starting in the 1990s.  The examiner opined that the claimed basal cell skin cancer was not incurred in or caused by the Veteran's military service, to include as due to exposure to herbicides.  In support of this conclusion, the examiner explained that there was no reported association between the development of basal cell skin cancer and herbicide exposure supported by medical literature.  Additionally, the examiner found that the claimed basal cell skin cancer was not the result of any exposure to generator exhaust fumes, oils, lubricants, cleaning solvents, hydraulic fluids  or radiation that is supported by medical literature after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and they synergistic combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. 

The Board finds this medical opinion is fully adequate. Here, the opinion writer fully addressed the nexus question. The opinion reflects that the writer reviewed the file, cited to medical literature to support the negative finding of an association between herbicide and/or toxin exposure and basal cell skin cancer, and provided an informed opinion fully responsive to the question at issue. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008). This opinion is valuable and is afforded significant weight.

The Board finds that the persuasive evidence weighs against the Veteran's claim that basal cell skin cancer had its onset during service or is related to service.  The Veteran's service treatment records reveal normal clinical evaluations at both the time of enlistment and the time of separation with respect to the Veteran's skin. Moreover, the February 2024 VA examiner considered the circumstances of the Veteran's service and the totality of possible exposures to herbicides and/or other toxins in rendering a negative etiological opinion. 

Although the Veteran is competent to report symptoms of his formally diagnosed basal cell skin cancer, he is not competent to relate basal cell skin cancer to active-duty exposure to herbicide exposure. Basal cell skin cancer is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical education to identify it as cancer. Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377, 1377 n.4 (specifically comparing the competency of a layperson to identify a simple condition, like a broken leg, but not to a form of cancer). As such, the Veteran is not competent to provide an opinion as to the etiology of the Veteran's skin cancer and the Veteran's statements in this regard lack weight. Consequently, without any competent evidence supporting the Veteran's contention, more probative weight is given to the competent medical evidence.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim for service connection for basal cell skin cancer.  As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
