ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, his tinnitus is etiologically related to acoustic trauma sustained in active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for establishing entitlement to service connection for tinnitus, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had honorable active-duty service with the United States Navy from August 1999 to August 2003.

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which as relevant here, denied the Veteran entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in August 2023, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the RO issued the decision on appeal, the Board may not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board acknowledges that in the July 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran also included the issue of service connection for hearing loss. However, the rating decision he sought to appeal from is not pending under the AMA system and cannot be addressed here. In July 2024, VA notified the Veteran of this and how to initiate an appeal of the legacy decision. See July 30, 2024, BVA NOD Clarification Letter. Accordingly, the foregoing decision focuses on service connection for tinnitus.

Service Connection for tinnitus

Service connection may be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). Generally, to establish service connection, a veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service." Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

In addition, for certain chronic diseases, such as tinnitus, a presumption of service connection arises if the chronic disease was shown as chronic in service; manifested to a compensable degree within one year following discharge from service; or was noted in service with continuity of symptomatology since service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1131, 1133, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, 3.309(a); Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the Veteran. See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994). Board determinations with respect to the weight and credibility of evidence are factual determinations going to the probative value of the evidence. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; not every item of evidence has the same probative value.

Competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility. Competency is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while credibility is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted. Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 465. Lay statements may serve to support a claim for service connection by supporting the occurrence of lay-observable events or the presence of disability or symptoms of disability subject to lay observation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159; see Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with a veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence weighs persuasively against a claim, in which case, the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Turning to the case, the Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection for tinnitus. He has maintained that his tinnitus was caused by in-service hazardous noise exposure and that the condition onset on active duty in 2001. See June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ and August 2023 VA examination.

Tinnitus is recognized by VA as a "chronic disease" under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); therefore, the presumptive provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.307, and 3.309 apply. Walker, 708 F.3d 1335-1337; Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015).

Favorable findings from the August 2023 rating decision on appeal include that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability, noting an August 2023, VA examination that shows a diagnosis of tinnitus.

In July 2024, the RO issued a rating decision, confirming and continuing the denial, following a special review mandated in February 2024, which returned the issue to correct a duty to assist error. Favorable findings from the July 2024 rating decision on appeal include that, "the evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during [] service. [] DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, of record shows that [his] Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) was Aviation Boatswain Mate, which is shown to have a probability of high hazardous noise exposure, exposure to hazardous noise for purpose of establishing an event in service is conceded, and VA audio examination conducted August 2023 shows a diagnosis of tinnitus.

The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Therefore, the first and second elements of service connection have been met.

Next, as to continuity, the Veteran has maintained that his in-service exposure to hazardous noise resulted in tinnitus since service. See July 2024 VA Form 10182. While there is an absence of complaints of, or treatment for tinnitus for many years after service separation, the Board has resolved reasonable doubt in his favor and finds that he had continuous symptoms of tinnitus since service separation and meets the requirements of presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).

Finally, as to nexus, a VA opinion was obtained in August 2023. The reviewer provided a negative nexus opinion for tinnitus. As rationale, the opinion mainly relied on a lack of evidence of tinnitus in service. As to tinnitus, it opined that the tinnitus was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) caused by in service hazardous noise exposure. The reviewer reasoned that due to a perceived delayed onset of associated symptomology, a nexus could not be established despite the conceded in-service noise exposure. Therefore, the opinion relied heavily on the lack of documented symptoms of tinnitus during service on entrance and/or separation examinations despite acknowledging no hearing being present upon entrance to service. The record also includes an August 2016 VA examination for hearing loss and tinnitus in which the VA examiner reported that the Veteran denied tinnitus in 2016. Nevertheless, the August 2023 VA examination notes that the Veteran's tinnitus was symptomatic of his hearing loss and the 2016 examination focused on his hearing loss in addition to tinnitus.

The Board finds the August 2023 VA medical opinion inadequate with respect to nexus and the claim for tinnitus, as a lack of in-service evidence alone is not a sufficient rationale to support a negative opinion. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

While the record does not include a medical opinion that indicates a nexus between the Veteran's tinnitus with service, the Board does not need to reach the weight assignable to any medical opinion because service connection is granted on a presumptive basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b) for the "chronic disease" of tinnitus (38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a)) based on a finding of "continuous" symptoms of tinnitus since service rather than on direct service connection.

In sum, there is evidence of acoustic trauma in service and continuous symptoms of tinnitus since service; therefore, tinnitus is presumed to have been incurred in service and the appeal is granted. Because the Board is granting service connection on a presumptive basis based on continuous symptoms of tinnitus since service separation, all other service connection theories are rendered moot.
