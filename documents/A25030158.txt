REMANDED

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from February 1996 to February 2000. A supplemental claim decision was issued in the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system, by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in April 2023. The Veteran requested higher-level review (HLR) of that decision in October 2023. In February 2024, the AOJ issued an HLR decision, which is the decision on appeal. 

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 supplemental claim decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in this decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. However, as a remand of this matter is warranted, any such evidence will be considered by the AOJ on remand.

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for GERD is remanded.

The Board must remand an appeal to the AOJ for correction of an error on the part of the AOJ to satisfy its duties under 38 U.S.C. 5103A if the error occurred prior to the date of the AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. This claim must be remanded for correction of the following pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The Veteran's GERD is rated by analogy under Diagnostic Code 7346 at 10 percent throughout the period under review, which the Board notes predates regulatory amendments that took effect in May 2024. 38 C.F.R. § 4.114. 

In an October 2021 statement, the Veteran reported his GERD caused heartburn with acid reflux and nausea at least once a day. He reported using Tums and Nexium, and that he was prescribed Omeprazole that he took three to four times per week, or as needed. He reported he had vitamin deficiencies due to a limited diet. He also reported experiencing shoulder pain during flareups of GERD, and sleep disturbances.  

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination later that month, and the examiner noted that the Veteran had GERD that was treated continuously with Nexium. The Veteran reported increased acid reflux after meals, more frequent at night. The examiner found that the Veteran had reflux, regurgitation, and three episodes of nausea per year. The examiner did not find pain of any type, to include in the arm or shoulder, nor did he note sleep disturbances.  

A January 2023 VA examination showed the Veteran reporting symptoms of reflux and regurgitation. The Veteran reported continuous use of Omeprazole. The examiner noted symptoms of nausea occurring 3 times a year and lasting less than a day, as well as reflux and regurgitation. The examiner again did not find pain of any type, to include in the arm or shoulder, nor did he note sleep disturbances.    

When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or medical opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007). Here, both VA examiners noted the Veteran was taking medication to control his GERD symptoms, but it is unclear whether the examination results are improperly based on the ameliorative effects of that medication.  See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012). Furthermore, it is unclear if the examiners considered all of the Veteran's symptoms when determining the severity of his condition, as the examination reports did not address the additional symptoms documented in the Veteran's October 2021 statement.

Therefore, the Board finds that a remand is required in this case to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error by obtaining an adequate examination that clarifies the severity and frequency of the Veteran's GERD symptoms, to include their severity in the absence of any beneficial effects of medication.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the severity of his GERD.  The claims file must be reviewed by the examiner in conjunction with the examination.  All appropriate tests and studies should be conducted and the results reported in detail.

The examiner must provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's GERD under the rating criteria (old, prior to May 19, 2024) and new, effective May 19, 2024).

The examiner is reminded to pay attention to the ameliorative effects of medication and describe its impacts on the GERD. If possible, the examiner should discuss what the Veteran's GERD would be like if he were not on medication. 

Please also review the Veteran's October 2021 description of his GERD symptoms (October 11, 2021 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim).

Please include a complete rationale for the opinions provided. If you cannot provide the requested opinions without resorting to speculation, please expressly indicate this and state why it is so.
