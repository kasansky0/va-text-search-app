ORDER

Entitlement for service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

1.	Prior to receipt of the July 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the most recent decision on the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD was issued in July 2017.

2.	The Veteran was issued a June 2020 Statement of the Case (SOC) adjudicating the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD; the Veteran did not timely perfect a legacy appeal or timely submit a VA Form 10182 to opt into the modernized (Appeals Modernization Act) system, and good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board to extend the time for such a filing.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the U.S. Army from February 1987 to September 1990.

This matter is associated with a July 2024 Notice of Disagreement in which the Veteran identified the issue he wished to appeal as entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder with a decision date of February 6, 2009. For the reasons described below, this appeal must be dismissed. 

Prior to receipt of the instant appeal, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) had most recently denied a claim for service connection for PTSD in July 2017. This July 2017 rating decision is a legacy decision, as it was issued prior to February 19, 2019, when the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) framework became effective. The Veteran was provided notice of the rating decision on July 14, 2017. See July 2017 Notification Letter. The Veteran then filed a timely notice of disagreement in the legacy system. See March 2018 VA Form 21-0958. On June 2, 2020, the Veteran was issued a statement of the case (SOC) that continued the denial of the claim.

The Board notes the July 2024 Notice of Disagreement specifies a February 2009 rating decision. The AOJ first denied the Veteran's claim for PTSD in January 2009. The Veteran was provided notice of the rating decision on February 6, 2009. See February 2009 Notification letter. The Veteran filed a timely notice of disagreement in the legacy system. See August 2009 VA Form 21-0958. On March 1, 2010, the Veteran was issued a statement of the case (SOC) that continued the denial of the claim. While the Veteran claimed he filed a substantive appeal timely, the Regional Office (RO) was unable to verify receipt of the appeal. See July 2011 correspondence. Additionally, even after the AOJ informed the Veteran they did not receive a timely substantive appeal in response to the March 2010 SOC, no substantive appeal was ever received. The claim was ultimately reopened in January 2013 and then again in November 2016.

After an SOC is issued on or after the effective date of the modernized appeals system, a veteran may elect to opt into the modernized system by filing for a review option under the new system on a form prescribed by the Secretary within the time allowed for filing a substantive appeal in the legacy (non-modernized system). 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400 (c)(2) and 19.2(d). The time limit to file a substantive appeal in the legacy system is within 60 days of the date the SOC was mailed or within the one year of the notice letter for the VA decision being appealed. 38 C.F.R. § 19.52 (b). Therefore, a veteran must elect to opt into the modernized system by submitting the prescribed form within that timeframe.

In this case, the notice letter for the most recent rating decision on the issues the Veteran is appealing was issued on July 14, 2017. The notice letter for the SOC on the issues the Veteran is appealing was issued on June 2, 2020. Accordingly, the Veteran had 60 days from June 2, 2020, to either file a substantive appeal to proceed in the legacy system or opt into the modernized appeals system by filing one of the prescribed modernized system review forms (as the one-year period after issuance of the 2017 rating decision had already passed). 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2400 (c)(2), 19.2(d), 19.52(b), 20.202. However, his VA Form 10182 was received on July 18, 2024, more than 60 days after the issuance of the SOC. It was thus untimely. Good cause for the delay in submitting the Notice of Disagreement is not presented elsewhere in the record.

The Board may dismiss a procedurally defective appeal if improperly docketed under claims processing rules. Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 333 (2021). Here, as the July 2024 Notice of Disagreement was not timely, and as good cause for an extension of the time for filing a Notice of Disagreement has not been presented, this appeal is dismissed.
