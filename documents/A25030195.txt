DOCKET NO. 240717-455904

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from August 1994 to August 1998 and March 1999 to March 2003.

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with VA's decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019. The AMA modernized review system applies to all claims for which VA issues a notice of an initial decision on or after the February 19, 2019 effective date of the modernized review system.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 higher-level review decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The Veteran's claim was initial denied in a May 2023 rating decision, which the Veteran timely appealed by filing an October 2023 VA form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review. The Veteran's claim was then denied in the February 2024 higher-level review decision.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the direct review option. For the Direct Lane docket, the Board's review is limited to the evidentiary record at the time of the RO decision on appeal. See Andrews v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 151, (2021). 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38?U.S.C. §?1110; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a). To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service-the so-called "nexus" requirement. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 38 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). The absence of any one element will result in the denial of service connection.

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; when?the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.?38?C.F.R. §?3.385. 

The Board notes that 38?C.F.R. §?3.385 has been upheld by the Court as a valid exercise of VA's regulatory authority. Palczewski v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?174 (2007). Thus, all hearing loss claims must meet the regulatory definition of hearing loss in § 3.385 to constitute a disability for VA purposes. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran contends that he has bilateral hearing loss due to his active-duty service; however, the Board finds the Veteran does not have hearing loss for VA purposes.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for bilateral hearing loss in April 2023. Regarding the Veteran's right ear, the Veteran did not exhibit auditory thresholds of 40 decibels or above in at least one frequency between 500 and 4000 hertz or above 26 decibels in at least three frequencies between 500 and 4000 hertz in ear the right ear, or a Maryland CNC score less than 94 percent. The examiner found the Veteran had normal hearing in the right ear. These audiological results are inconsistent with a finding of hearing loss as a disability for VA purposes. 38?C.F.R. §?3.385. Accordingly, the Veteran does not have a current disability of right ear hearing loss.

Regarding the Veteran's left ear, the Veteran did not exhibit auditory thresholds of 40 decibels or above in at least one frequency between 500 and 4000 hertz or above 26 decibels in at least three frequencies between 500 and 4000 hertz in ear the left ear, or a Maryland CNC score less than 94 percent. The examiner found the Veteran had normal hearing in the left ear. These audiological results are inconsistent with a finding of hearing loss as a disability for VA purposes. 38?C.F.R. §?3.385. Accordingly, the Veteran does not have a current disability of left ear hearing loss.

While the Board acknowledges the Veteran's frustration, unfortunately, without a current disability, service connection for hearing loss cannot be established. See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3?Vet. App.?223, 224 (1992) (a current diagnosis is a cornerstone of a service connection claim). 

As such, the claim for service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.
