ORDER

Service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's tinnitus had its onset in service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 1154(a), 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 1987 to November 1988.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

On a final preliminary note, the Board interprets the Veteran's statements as reflecting an intent to have this matter reviewed in an expeditious manner, which the Board finds to be an implicit waiver of the Veteran's right to change Board dockets under Williams v. McDonough, 37?Vet. App.?305 (2024). 

Service connection for tinnitus is granted. 

The Veteran seeks service connection for tinnitus.  Specifically, the Veteran claimed ears ringing caused by an-service event of basic training firing weapons, armorer while active duty, and delivering supplies in five-ton vehicles.  See June 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ. 

Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Here, all three elements of service connection are established by the competent and credible lay and medical evidence of record.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection will be presumed for certain chronic diseases, such as arthritis, if manifest to a compensable degree within one year after discharge from service.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  Presumptive service connection for chronic diseases must be considered on three bases: chronicity during service, manifestations within one year of a Veteran's separation from service, and continuity of symptomatology since service.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

At the onset, the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran has been diagnosed with bilateral tinnitus and the evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during your service.  See July 2023 Rating Decision Favorable Findings.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). 

The July 2023 VA examiner provided a negative nexus opinion regarding tinnitus.  The examiner acknowledged the Veteran was awarded an M16 marksman rifle award, but stated the Veteran's MOS of unit supply specialist had a low probability of hazardous noise exposure.  The Veteran reported noticing his symptoms many years ago and never paid attention to it because he thought it was just normal.  The examiner gave a negative nexus based on an absence of in-service hearing loss records and the time passed between service and the claim.  See July 2023 VA examination. 

The Veteran's representative, American Legion, submitted an Informal Hearing Presentation (IHP) on behalf of the Veteran in September 2024.  In the IHP his representative contended the Veteran was exposed to noise in the military and that tinnitus can manifest itself well after the trauma has occurred.  See September 2024 IHP. 

The Board finds that the Veteran's statements constitute competent and credible evidence that his current tinnitus began during service and have been recurrent since that time.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002); see also Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Board ascribes no probative value to the examiner's opinion as it does not address the Veteran's competent, credible report of recurrent ringing in the ears since service.  See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39 (2007).

With respect to continuity of symptomatology, VA recognizes tinnitus as a chronic disease and the Court has held that, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), the theory of continuity of symptomatology is an alternative route to establish service connection for specific chronic diseases and can only be used in cases involving those conditions explicitly recognized as chronic under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  See Walker.  The Court has held that tinnitus is an organic disease of the nervous system for purposes of 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a).  Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258 (2015). 

For the above reasons, the evidence is, at worst, evenly balanced or approximately so with regard to whether the Veteran's current tinnitus had its onset during service.  

Based on the Veteran's credible lay statements as to the onset of his tinnitus, as well as the favorable finding that the injury had its onset in service, finding the evidence in equipoise, the Board finds that service connection for tinnitus is warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b); see also Walker; Fountain.
