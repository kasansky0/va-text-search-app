FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence persuasively weights against finding that the Veteran's claimed back injury had its onset in service or was caused or related to his service.

2. The evidence persuasively weights against finding that the Veteran's claimed right knee injury had its onset in service or was caused or related to his service.

3. The evidence persuasively weights against finding that the Veteran's claimed right leg disability had its onset in service or was caused or related to his service.

4. The evidence persuasively weights against finding that the Veteran's claimed right shoulder injury had its onset in service or was caused or related to his service.

5. The evidence persuasively weights against finding that the Veteran's claimed TBI had its onset in service or was caused or related to his service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for back injury are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right knee injury are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right leg disability are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303.

4. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for right shoulder injury are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303.

5. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for TBI are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1976 to November 1980.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The Veteran selected the Direct Review Lane when he submitted a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, in May 2024. In the direct review lane, the Board reviews the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) rating decision for each issue. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board notes that additional evidence was added to the Veteran's claims file in May 2024, in the form of a Veteran correspondence. However, as the Veteran elected the direct review lane, this evidence is ineligible for review. Under the direct review lane, only evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 rating decision is eligible for review.

SERVICE CONNECTION

1. Entitlement to service connection for back injury

2. Entitlement to service connection for right knee injury

3. Entitlement to service connection for right leg disability

4. Entitlement to service connection for right shoulder injury

5. Entitlement to service connection for traumatic brain injury (TBI)

The Veteran asserts entitlement to service connection for back, right knee, right leg, right shoulder, and TBI disabilities. Specifically, the Veteran contends that he fell down a manhole while serving aboard the USS Juneau, injuring himself. See January 2024 Veteran Correspondence. As the Veteran relates all his service connection claims to the same in-service injury, the Board will discuss them collectively.

Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381, F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

Where a veteran who served for ninety days or more during a period of war (or during peacetime service after December 31, 1946) develops certain chronic diseases, such as hypertension, to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year from separation from service, such diseases may be presumed to have incurred in service even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. This presumption is rebuttable by evidence to the contrary. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

Where the veteran asserts entitlement to a chronic disease, but there is insufficient evidence of a diagnosis in service, the veteran can establish service connection by demonstrating a continuity of symptomatology since service, if the chronic disease is listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1337-39 (Fed. Cir. 2013). For disabilities that are not listed as chronic under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b), service connection may be based upon a showing of in-service incurrence or aggravation under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a), or by showing that a disease that was first diagnosed after service is related to service under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

The determination of whether the requirements of service connection have been met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value. See Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1, 8 (1999). In making these determinations, the Board must consider and assess the credibility and weight of all evidence in the claim file, including the medical and lay evidence, to determine its probative value. In doing so, the Board must provide its reasoning for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant. See Masors v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 181 (1992); Wilson v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 614, 618 (1992); Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).

When there is an approximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each issue shall be given to the claimant. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3. A claimant need only demonstrate an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence in order to prevail.  See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).

The ultimate question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury or disease.

The Veteran contends that he injured his back, right knee, right leg, right shoulder, and head in service while aboard USS Juneau. See January 2024 Veteran Correspondence. The Veteran reports that he fell through a manhole on the USS Juneau and received medical care. Id. The Board finds the Veteran competent to report on his injury and symptoms during active service. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge). However, for the following reasons, the Board does not find the Veteran's statements concerning an in-service injury and symptoms to be credible.

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) does not show any evidence of the reported fall and resulting injuries. 

In determining whether a claimant's statements are credible, the Board may consider their internal consistency, facial plausibility, and consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the claimant. Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table). Further, the Board, "as fact finder, is obligated to, and fully justified in, determining whether lay evidence is credible in and of itself, i.e., because of possible bias[.]"). Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

The Board may also find that a claimant's statements lack credibility based on an absence of evidence in certain circumstances. Specifically, there must be a proper foundation to draw adverse inferences against the credibility of testimony from silence in the record. Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 272 (2015); Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 224 (2011). Such a foundation may be established by finding that the fact being claimed would ordinarily have been recorded in the available records had it occurred. Id. Thus, the Board may not rely on an absence of treatment without explaining "why the appellant would reasonably have been expected to report his symptoms to medical providers." Fountain, 27. Vet. App. at 273. The Board must also consider whether it is qualified to make that determination, or whether independent medical evidence is required. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 434-35 (2011) (holding that the Board improperly found that a claimed injury would have been documented at the time, as there was no independent medical evidence to support that determination.)

Here, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements concerning an in-service injury and symptoms lack credibility not only based on silence on the record, but also because they are inconsistent with more probative evidence. As noted above, there is no evidence of any injury or treatment in the Veteran's STRs. The Board further notes that in the same statement describing the claimed onboard injury, the Veteran also reports going to the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand. However, review of the Veteran's military personnel records shows no foreign service. See DD 214. Therefore, the Board does not find the Veteran's statements credible. 

The Board accordingly finds service connection is not warranted for back, right knee, right leg, right shoulder, and TBI disabilities. Although the AOJ did not provide VA examinations for the back, right knee, right leg, right shoulder, and TBI disabilities, examinations were not required, because there is no credible evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in active service. McLendon, 20 Vet. App. 79. Entitlement to service connection for back, right knee, right leg, right shoulder, and TBI disabilities are denied.
