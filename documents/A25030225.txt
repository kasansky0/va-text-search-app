ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date earlier than February 23, 2023, for the award of service connection for the cause of death is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran died in August 2001. 

2. The appellant applied for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits based on service connection for the Veteran's cause of death in September 2001. She stated that the Veteran's PTSD led to his death. 

3. Entitlement to service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death was denied in a May 2002 rating decision. The appellant appealed this decision to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board), and it denied the claim in a June 2004 Board decision. This Board decision was vacated in June 2005 and the appellant appealed the issue a second time in October 2006. In May 2007, the Board denied the claim again and it is final. 

4. Following the appellant's request to reopen the claims on two subsequent occasions, in August 2014 and May 2017, the Board denied the claim due to a lack of new and material evidence. Both decisions are final. 

5. In February 2023, the appellant filed a Supplemental Claim for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits based on service connection for the Veteran's cause of death. The claim was granted in December 2023 with an effective date of February 23, 2023.

6. There are no formal or informal claims from the appellant that are still pending that were submitted after May 2017 and prior to February 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date earlier than February 23, 2023, for the award of service connection for the cause of death have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from May 1968 to November 1969. He died in August 2001, and the appellant is his surviving spouse.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a December 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), which granted service connection for cause of death. In January 2024, the appellant submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, in which she elected the Direct review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another rating decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Earlier Effective Date for Cause of Veteran's Death

The appellant has requested an earlier effective date of August 2, 2001, for entitlement to service connection for the cause of Veteran's death. 

The appellant first submitted a claim for Dependency and Indemnity compensation (DIC) benefits based on service connection for the Veteran's cause of death in September 2001. The Veteran's death certificate showed his cause of death was massive head injuries. The claim was denied in a May 2002 rating decision on the basis that the Veteran's cause of death was not related to his military service.

The appellant appealed the claim to the Board, which denied it in a June 2004 decision. The Board found that medical evidence did not demonstrate that the Veteran's cause of death was the result of an injury or disease incurred during active service, or manifest within one year following discharge. This decision was then vacated and remanded in June 2005 because the Board failed to comply with the appellant's request for a videoconference hearing. In May 2007, the Board issued a new decision on the matter, and denied the claim for a second time. The appellant attempted to appeal this decision to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC), however her appeal was not timely and was dismissed. The appellant did not timely appeal this decision, therefore the May 2007 Board decision is final. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100.

After this decision, the appellant submitted a new claim for DIC benefits based on service connection for the Veteran's cause of death in March 2008. Later, she submitted a request to reopen the May 2007 decision, and submitted evidence in support of the request. In a May 2012 decision, the AOJ found no new and material evidence was submitted and the claim was denied. In April 2013 the appellant appealed this decision to the Board, and in August 2014, the Board denied the claim. In June 2016, the appellant's attorney and VA's General Counsel filed a Joint Motion for Remand before CAVC. In a June 2016 decision, CAVC granted the request to vacate the decision. Upon remand, the Board once again denied the claim in a May 2017 decision. This decision was not appealed and is final. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1100.

After this decision, no correspondence of any kind was received until February 2023. On February 23, 2023, the Veteran submitted a Supplemental Claim application for entitlement to service connection based on Veteran's cause of death. In August 2023, the Supplemental Claim was denied for a lack of new and relevant evidence. In September 2023, the appellant filed a request for Higher-Level Review and in October 2023, the AOJ found a duty to assist error for failure to obtain records. The claim was readjudicated after the records were obtained and in an October 2023 decision, the AOJ denied the claim once more. However, after receiving additional records, the AOJ granted entitlement to service connection for Veteran's cause of death in December 2023. 

This claim was effectuated in the December 2023 rating decision, which initially assigned an effective date of February 23, 2023. 

The Board finds that the Regional Office correctly awarded the earliest possible effective date. 

The statutory and regulatory guidelines for the determination of an effective date of an award of disability compensation are set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date of an evaluation and an award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date the claim was received, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

For claims or appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015, a claim for benefits must be submitted on a standardized form. Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660, 57,686 (Sept. 25, 2014) (eff. Mar. 24, 2015). Claims or appeals pending before VA on that date are to be decided based on the regulations as they existed prior to the amendment. Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660, 57,686.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a), the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), is applicable to all claims or requests for readjudicating finally decided claims for which VA issues notice of a decision on or after the effective date of the AMA. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019. 38 C.F.R. § 19.2 (a).

Under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the notice of a decision was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c). If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h). Following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a Supplemental Claim, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a new supplemental Claim, a higher-level review request, or a VA Form 10182, Appeal to the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 2.500 (c)(1). Following notice of a decision on a Higher-Level Review by the AOJ, continuous pursuit can be established by filing either a supplemental Claim or a VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 2.500 (c)(2).

The Board finds that the May 2017 Board decision was final because the appellant did not appeal this decision within one year of its issuance. The next correspondence from the appellant indicating a desire to seek service connection for the Veteran's cause of death was in February 2023. The claims file shows the appellant did not file a formal claim in the time between the May 2017 Board decision and the February 2023 Supplemental Claim. 

Therefore, because the appellant did not further appeal the May 2017 Board decision and it became final, the earliest possible effective date from which the Veteran's claims may be granted is the date of his February 23, 2023 Supplemental Claim. Thus, the claim for an effective date earlier than February 23, 2023, for the cause of the Veteran's death, is denied.

The Board has considered the appellant's contentions with regard to the effective date for the award of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death, including her written statements that VA failed to obtain favorable evidence that existed at the time she first filed her claim. Her assertions that VA failed to fulfill its duty to assist have been previously addressed, specifically in the May 2017 final Board decision, which determined that new and material evidence had not been received to reopen the claim. Despite the appellant's argument, the fact remains that she did not appeal the May 2017 Board decision and did not submit a new claim for benefits until February 2023. Although the Board is sympathetic to the appellant's contentions, the Board is bound by law, and its decision is dictated by the relevant statutes and regulations. Moreover, the Board is without authority to grant benefits simply because it might perceive such a grant to be equitable.  See Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416, 425(1994). The Board also observes that "no equities, no matter how compelling, can create a right to payment out of the United States Treasury that has not been provided for by Congress."  Smith v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 429, 432-33(1992). The appellant's lay statements do not support the assignment of an effective date prior to her February 2023 Supplemental Claim.

In sum, there is no basis under law which would allow the Board to assign an effective earlier than February 23, 2023 for the award of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994). The claim is denied.
