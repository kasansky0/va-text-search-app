REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for depression and anxiety is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1971 to February 1973.

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for anxiety and depression most recently addressed in a June 2009 rating decision. In March 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The issue of entitlement to service connection for depression and anxiety is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the March 2024 rating decision on appeal. The Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) obtained a January 2024 medical opinion prior to the rating decision on appeal. However, this medical opinion does not provide an adequate rationale regarding whether the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disability had its onset in service or is otherwise related to service.

The Veteran reported that in service he had a physiological reaction due to stress, and he developed a bald spot on the side of his head. He indicated that he was told it was due to stress and that he received some form of injections for the condition in service. Service treatment records confirm treatment for alopecia areata in service.

When providing a negative nexus opinion, the January 2024 examiner opined that although the Veteran reported anxiety during the service, there is nothing in the claims file to indicate treatment of any type or changes in behaviors or other indicators that would suggest depression or anxiety disorder being present while in    the service.

VA has a duty to ensure that any medical examination or opinion it provides is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007). A medical opinion is adequate where it is based upon consideration of the full medical history and describes a disability in sufficient detail so that the Board's evaluation will be fully informed. Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 123 (2007).

The January 2024 examiner's opinion failed to address the documented alopecia areata in service, and whether it was a physiological reaction due to stress or anxiety in service. An addendum opinion should be provided to address this issue.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion to answer whether the Veteran's depressive disorder with anxious distress is at least as likely as not related to service.

The examiner should address the Veteran's treatment for alopecia areata in service and discuss whether it is relevant to the Veteran's claimed stress/anxiety in service, and his current depressive disorder with anxious distress.
