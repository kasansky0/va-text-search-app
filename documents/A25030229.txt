REMANDED

Entitlement to a compensable rating for bilateral corneal opacity (hereinafter, "bilateral eye disability") is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from April 1977 to January 1987.  As detailed in a March 2019 administrative decision, his service from April 1977 to March 1986 is considered honorable for VA purposes, while his service from April 1986 to January 1987 is considered dishonorable for VA purposes, which is a bar to the receipt of VA benefits based on that period of service.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2019 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.  The Veteran timely appealed to the Board in May 2020, requesting the hearing review option.  See May 2020 VA Form 10182; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(2).

In April 2023, the Veteran testified at a virtual Board hearing before a Veterans Law Judge.  A transcript of that hearing has been associated with the record.  

In May 2024, the Board, in pertinent part, denied a compensable rating for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral eye disability.  He appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (Court).  In November 2024, the Court granted a Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR) filed by the parties to the appeal (the Veteran, through an attorney, and representatives from VA General Counsel), thereby vacating the Board's decision insofar as it denied a compensable rating for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral eye disability and remanding that matter for readjudication.  The appeal as to the remaining issues addressed in the Board's decision was dismissed.

Under the hearing review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of issuance of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  The Board cannot consider (1) evidence submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and before the hearing was held, or (2) evidence submitted more than 90 days after the hearing was held.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302.

That said, for the reasons set forth below, the Board is remanding the claim here on appeal to the AOJ for correction of a pre-decisional error.  The AOJ will consider any additional evidence that has been submitted when the claim is readjudicated.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to a compensable rating for bilateral eye disability is remanded.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(d)(1), claimants are "entitled to a hearing on any issue involved in a claim within the purview of part 3 of this chapter before VA issues notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim."  In the JMPR filed with the Court, the parties to the JMPR agreed that the Veteran was not provided notice of his right to a pre-decisional hearing before the AOJ issued the May 2019 rating decision on appeal.  The parties agreed further that the Board erred when it failed to remand the case to the AOJ based on its failure to satisfy that regulatory duty.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(b)(1), (d)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The JMPR directed the Board to remand the Veteran's claim to the AOJ with instructions to provide the Veteran notice of his right to a pre-decisional AOJ hearing.  As the Board is bound by the Court's Order granting the JMPR, a remand is required.

This matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Provide notice to the Veteran of his right to request, and participate in, a pre-decisional AOJ hearing as to the issue of entitlement to a compensable rating for his service-connected bilateral corneal opacity.
