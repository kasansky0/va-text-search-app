FINDING OF FACT

In December 2024, the Veteran died while this appeal was pending.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran/appellant, the criteria for the dismissal of this appeal have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1960 to February 1963. This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from June and August 2023 rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

Unfortunately, the Veteran/appellant died during the pendency of the appeal. Therefore, as a matter of law, the Board cannot issue a decision on the underlying claim at this time and must dismiss this appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302(a).

The Board's dismissal does not affect the right of an eligible person to take the Veteran's place to continue the appeal on the pending claims. This process, known as substitution, must be requested within one year of the Veteran's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a), (b). Individuals who may be eligible for substitution include the Veteran's surviving spouse, dependent children, dependent parents, and those who bore the expenses of last sickness or burial. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000(a), 3.1010(a).

Here, there is no indication that VA received a request for substitution. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
