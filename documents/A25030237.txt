ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as secondary to service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The probative evidence of record is at least in approximate balance that the Veteran's hypertension condition is proximately due to or aggravated by the Veteran's service-connected PTSD.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hypertension as secondary to service-connected PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Air Force on active duty from November 1978 to November 1998.

The issue comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2023 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In June 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for hypertension. In November 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision, which found new and relevant evidence had been submitted and readjudicated the claim for service connection on the merits. Therefore, the Board may proceed to the merits of the underlying claim for service connection. In December 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review of the November 2022 rating decision. The AOJ subsequently issued the March 2023 rating decision on appeal.  

In the April 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as secondary to service-connected PTSD

The Veteran contends that his diagnosed hypertension is related to his active-duty service, to include as secondary to his service-connected PTSD and obesity due to PTSD. See August 2021 claim; see also, August 2021 statement in support of claim. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Service connection may be warranted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (d).

As a general matter, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show: (1) that a current disability exists; and (2) that the current disability was either caused or aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

VA has a duty to provide the veteran a thorough medical examination, one which takes into account the veteran's prior medical history and describes the disability in sufficient detail so that the Board's evaluation of the claimed disability is fully informed. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). A VA examination must contain clear conclusions with supporting data, and a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301 (2008).

Additionally, when a veteran's claim includes a secondary service connection theory of entitlement, VA must provide an opinion as to whether the veteran's claimed disability is proximately due to or aggravated by his service-connected disabilities. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; see also, El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 138-40 (2012). Causation and aggravation are independent concepts, and VA must ensure medical examinations have separate findings and rationales. See Atencio v. O'Rourke, 30 Vet. App. 74, 91 (2018).

In the AOJ's March 2023 rating decision, it issued favorable findings as to the Veteran's diagnosis of hypertension, diagnosis of PTSD as a primary service-connected disability, that hypertension is a chronic disease which may be subject to presumptive service connection, and that the Veteran's service meets the minimum requirements for presumptive service connection. Thus, the Board is bound by these favorable findings, and finds that the Veteran has a diagnosis of hypertension meeting the first element of secondary service connection. 

The Veteran submitted an August 2021 statement in support of claim in which he reported that, as a result of his PTSD, he has been "less motivated, less active, and... eaten less-health food options as a source of comfort." See August 2021 statement in support of claim. The Veteran contended that his hypertension was the result of his obesity which was caused by his service-connected PTSD. Id. He also noted his marked weight-gain from 147 pounds to 190 pounds between entrance into service and after. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in September 2021, in which the examiner confirmed the Veteran's hypertension diagnosis. The Veteran reported noticing elevated blood pressure since beginning his PTSD medication a few years prior. The examiner concluded that the Veteran's hypertension was less likely than not proximately due to or the result of his service-connected PTSD. In her rationale, she found that hypertension tended to gradually develop over many years, and that the pharmacy lists did not reflect a worsening of his hypertension. She stated that his smoking also contributed to his hypertension. 

The Board finds that the examiner's rationale to be incomplete as it failed to consider the Veteran's contention that his weight gain caused by his PTSD had resulted in hypertension. See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (holding that a medical opinion based upon an incomplete or inaccurate factual premise has no probative value); see also, Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 311. Therefore, the Board finds the September 2021 opinion to be inadequate and consequently holds minimal probative value. Additionally, the examiner did not provide a separate rationale for aggravation for the Veteran's secondary theory of entitlement, and the opinion is inadequate for this reason as well. See Atencio, 30 Vet. App. at 91.

In June 2022, the Veteran provided a May 2022 private medical opinion. The private provider concluded that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran's hypertension was secondary to, related to, and/or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD. The private provider noted the medically established positive correlation between weight and mental health conditions, including PTSD. He also addressed the Veteran's lay statements reflecting his weight gain since service due to his psychiatric condition, and cited to many established studies in medical literature noting an increased risk of hypertension associated with psychological trauma and psychiatric symptoms which can lead to high blood pressure and/or obesity. The private clinician cited to medical literature regarding PTSD and hypertension.

The Board further notes that the standard under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 requires a determination of whether the current disability was either caused or aggravated by a service-connected disability. It is clear from the private provider's opinion that she concluded that the Veteran's hypertension was caused by or aggravated by service. As the regulation states that a disability can either be caused or aggravated by a service-connected disability, the private provider's conclusion satisfied that element. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

Therefore, the Board finds the May 2022 private medical opinion to be probative evidence that the Veteran's hypertension is secondary to the Veteran's service-connected PTSD. The Board assigns significant probative weight to the May 2022 private medical opinion, as the opinion was supported by a fully articulated rationale with consideration of the Veteran's medical history and established medical literature. See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444 (2000); see also, Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467 (1993).

The Veteran also underwent a VA examination in July 2022, with a medical opinion provided in an October 2022 addendum by the same examiner as the September 2021 VA examination. The examiner concluded that the Veteran's hypertension was less likely than not caused or aggravated by his PTSD or obesity due to PTSD. In her rationale, the October 2022 examiner noted that no medical literature supported a finding that PTSD caused hypertension. She also found that the cause of obesity is consuming more calories than are burned off, and found that although PTSD could lead to an eating disorder in which obesity may result, the medical documentation did not reflect the Veteran having an eating disorder. The examiner also found that the Veteran's father's diagnoses of hypertension and cardiovascular heart disease put him at greater risk of developing hypertension, in addition to smoking. 

Again, the October 2022 addendum opinion did not address the Veteran's August 2021 lay statements stating that his PTSD led to him being less motivated and less active, which has led to his obesity. The examiner also did not consider or address the medical literature cited in the May 2022 private medical opinion in support of finding a link between hypertension, obesity, and psychiatric conditions. The October 2022 addendum opinion is therefore inadequate for these reasons. See Reonal, 5 Vet. App. at 461; see also, Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 311; see also, Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 301.

Additionally, the examiner provided a single rationale and opinion regarding both causation and aggravation; as causation and aggravation are independent concepts, separate rationales are required for each, and the opinion is also inadequate for this reason. See Atencio, 30 Vet. App. at 91. 

Resolving the evidence in a light most favorable to the Veteran, the Board finds the May 2022 private medical opinion to be substantially probative evidence that the Veteran's hypertension is secondary to his service-connected PTSD, as the opinion was supported by a fully articulated rationale with consideration of the Veteran's medical history and established medical literature. See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444 (2000); see also, Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467 (1993). However, the September 2021 and October 2022 VA opinions were inadequate and hold little probative value.

Thus, as the competent probative medical evidence of record demonstrates the Veteran's hypertension is secondary to his service-connected PTSD, the criteria for service connection have been met, and the Veteran's claim is granted.
