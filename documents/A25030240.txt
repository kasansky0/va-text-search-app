ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, his bilateral hearing loss is at least as likely as not related to military service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.385. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1963 to June 1967.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In December 2024, the Veteran filed a notice of disagreement and selected the Evidence Submission docket. See December 2024 VA Form 10182. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. 

If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

As an initial matter, the Board notes the Veteran has the right to select a different Board review option by submitting a new VA Form 10182 within one year from the date the AOJ mailed the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, whichever date is later. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2); see Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). Although the period to change dockets per 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) has not elapsed, the Veteran submitted additional evidence on December 23, 2024. As such, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in proceeding to adjudicate the appeal.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence establishes the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

VA is required to give due consideration to all pertinent medical and lay evidence in evaluating a claim for disability benefits. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a). Lay testimony is competent to prove that a claimant exhibited certain lay-observable symptoms and the time that those symptoms appeared. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). Lay evidence cannot be determined to be not credible merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence. Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1336-37 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

In determining the probative value to be assigned to a medical opinion, the Board must consider three factors: whether a medical expert was fully informed of the pertinent factual premises (i.e., medical history) of the case; whether the medical expert provided a fully articulated opinion; and whether the opinion is supported by a reasoned analysis. The most probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302-04 (2008).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is persuasively against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. Id.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral hearing loss as the result of hazardous noise exposure while on active duty. See June 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ. The Veteran asserts his hearing loss is the result of noise exposure due to his military occupational specialty (MOS) as a field artillery unit commander. See March 2025 Informal Hearing Presentation (IHP). 

For the purposes of applying the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. The threshold for normal hearing is from zero to 20 decibels, and higher threshold levels indicate some degree of hearing loss. Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 160 (1993). 

The evidence of record demonstrates the first element of service connection has been met, as the Veteran has a current disability of bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes. The December 2024 rating decision contains a favorable finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss. 

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in November 2024. The Veteran reported he has some difficulties with understanding speech and volume. Speech recognition testing utilizing the Maryland CNC Test measured recognition ability of 100 percent in the right ear and 94 percent in the left ear. The audiometric evaluation revealed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows:

	HERTZ

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	15	15	20	50	35

LEFT	5	10	20	65	55

Based on the above, the Board finds the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss does rise to the level of impairment considered hearing loss for VA purposes. Testing at 3000 Hertz was greater than 40 decibels in the right and left ears, and 4000 Hertz was greater than 40 decibels in the left ear. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. Accordingly, the Board finds the first element of service connection for bilateral hearing loss has been met. 

The evidence of record reflects the second element of service connection, an in-service incurrence, has been met. The December 2024 rating decision contains a favorable finding that the Veteran experienced a qualifying event, injury, or disease with an onset during active service. The Veteran's MOS was field artillery, which has a high probability of noise exposure. As the Board is bound by such a finding, the record demonstrates the second element of service connection has been established. 

Turning to a nexus, the Board notes there is evidence both in favor and against the claim. Weighing against the claim is the negative November 2024 VA opinion. See November 2024 Hearing Loss and Tinnitus Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ). The examiner provided a diagnosis of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and noted that no significant threshold shifts were identified at separation. Accordingly, the examiner opined the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss is less likely than not caused by or the result of an event in service. 

In this instance, the Board finds the November 2024 VA opinion to be inadequate. When VA undertakes to obtain an examination, it must ensure that the examination is adequate. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007). Here, the examiner relied on the Veteran's lack of significant threshold shifts at separation as the sole basis for the negative nexus opinion but failed to provide any further rationale. Moreover, the examiner failed to address the Veteran's high probability of noise exposure, or any of his lay statements reporting that bilateral hearing loss began in service and has continued since that time. 

The Board further notes the examiner utilized the Veteran's in-service noise exposure to support a positive nexus opinion for tinnitus but provided no explanation as to why the noise exposure was not sufficient to have caused his current hearing loss. Accordingly, the Board finds the November 2024 opinion inadequate, and therefore, of limited probative value due to its failure to consider all relevant evidence of record and provide a sufficient rationale. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, supra. 

In favor of the claim, the Veteran stated the initial onset of his bilateral hearing loss occurred on active duty. See June 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ. The Veteran reported exposure to hazardous noise due to his MOS in field artillery and has continued to experience hearing loss since his discharge from service. See December 2024 Statement. The Veteran is competent to report on circumstances capable of lay observation, including his in-service duties as well as symptoms of hearing loss. Layno, supra.

At this juncture, the Veteran has been diagnosed with bilateral hearing loss for VA purposes and in-service noise exposure was conceded. The Veteran has provided competent and credible lay statements regarding the onset of his bilateral hearing loss, consistent with VA's concession that the MOS of field artillery unit commander has a high probability of noise exposure. 

Accordingly, after resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the overall evidence of record is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's diagnosed bilateral hearing loss is the result of his military service and resulting noise exposure. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. As such, service connection for bilateral hearing loss is warranted and the instant appeal is granted.
