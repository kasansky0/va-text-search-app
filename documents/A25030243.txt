REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from February 1971 to January 1973, with additional service in the Marine Corps Reserve and Army National Guard, with "active duty, active duty training, or full-time training duty" in July 1974 and from June 1975 to July 1975.  

In an April 2022 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) denied the claims for service connection.  In April 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the April 2022 decision.  In May 2022, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the April 2022 decision.  In the June 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2022 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

The claims for service connection are remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.  VA has not obtained the Veteran's complete VA treatment records.  Although the record includes VA treatment records, the treatment records of record, while spanning many years, are not a complete record.  Notably, there are missing records dated from February 2007 to October 2011, from November 2013 to January 2016, and from December 2018.  The outstanding VA treatment records must be obtained. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Associate all outstanding VA treatment records with the record.
