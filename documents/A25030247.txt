DOCKET NO. 240710-454015
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), to include chronic bronchitis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The AOJ impermissibly combined the Veteran's COPD and chronic bronchitis with his service-connected obstructive sleep apnea; entitlement to service connection for COPD, to include chronic bronchitis is warranted. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for COPD, to include chronic bronchitis, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the Army from November 1990 to October 2012. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Entitlement to service connection for COPD, to include chronic bronchitis

In an October 2024 rating decision, subsequent to the December 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ combined the Veteran's disabilities of obstructive sleep apnea and his respiratory conditions of COPD and chronic bronchitis. The provided reasoning was that, per 38 C.F.R. § 4.14, the evaluation of the same disability under different diagnoses is to be avoided. The AOJ further explained that in the Veteran's case, his obstructive sleep apnea, COPD, and chronic bronchitis were evaluated based on the same manifestation of symptoms, therefore a single rating was assigned under the diagnostic code that reflects his predominant disability (obstructive sleep apnea). 

However, the Board finds that this determination was made in error, because obstructive sleep apnea and COPD and chronic bronchitis do not have the same manifestation of symptoms. In fact, although COPD (DC 6604) and chronic bronchitis (DC 6600) share the same rating criteria, obstructive sleep apnea (DC 6847) has a completely different set of rating criteria. Furthermore, it appears that the AOJ skipped the process of granting entitlement to service connection for COPD and chronic bronchitis in favor of combining it with the Veteran's service-connected obstructive sleep apnea. 

To rectify this issue, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for COPD, to include chronic bronchitis as a separate condition from the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is warranted.
