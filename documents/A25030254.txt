ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than January 20, 2022, for eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) based on permanent and total disability status is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date of January 20, 2022, but no earlier, for entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of January 20, 2022, but no earlier, for entitlement to special monthly compensation based on loss of use of a creative organ is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of January 20, 2022, but no earlier, for entitlement to service connection for right knee degenerative arthritis with patellofemoral pain syndrome is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a March 2025 rating decision issued while this appeal was pending, the AOJ granted an effective date of January 20, 2022, for eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status.

2. The Veteran has continuously pursued his erectile dysfunction claim since April 14, 2021, but was granted service connection as secondary to his service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which, while this appeal was pending, was granted an effective date of January 20, 2022.

3. As of this decision, the Veteran is service connected for the underlying disability of erectile dysfunction, which results in the loss of use of a creative organ, effective January 20, 2022. 

4. On January 20, 2022, the Veteran filed an Intent to File a Claim, subsequently filed a VA 21-526EZ within one-year of that date and has since continuously pursued his claim of entitlement to service connection for right knee degenerative arthritis with patellofemoral pain syndrome.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than January 20, 2022, for eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status, are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of January 20, 2022, but no earlier, for entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155, 3.400.

3. The criteria for an earlier effective date of January 20, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of special monthly compensation based on loss of use of a creative organ have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

4. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of January 20, 2022, but no earlier, for entitlement to service connection for right knee degenerative arthritis with patellofemoral pain syndrome have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 2005 to October 2005, August 2010 to August 2011, June 2018 to February 2019, April 2019 to September 2019, and October 2020 to November 2021, with additional service in the Army National Guard.

The matter is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from June, August, and October 2023 rating decisions issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). Thus, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

For the claims of entitlement to an earlier effective date for erectile dysfunction and special monthly compensation based on loss of use of a creative organ, although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the January 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. 

For the claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for degenerative arthritis, right knee, with patellofemoral pain syndrome, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, in January 2023 and requested readjudication of the claim of entitlement to service connection most recently addressed in a July 2019 rating decision. In August 2023, the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and granted service connection for degenerative arthritis, right knee, with patellofemoral pain syndrome, with an evaluation of 40 percent effective January 19, 2023. 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of each claim's associated AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than January 20, 2022, for eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status is denied.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the grant of eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability. See June 2024 VA Form 10182.  

For the purposes of educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, the child or surviving spouse of a Veteran will have basic eligibility if the following conditions are met: (1) the Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the Veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the Veteran's death; or (4) the Veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510, 3512; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807(a), 21.3021.

While this appeal was pending, a separate Board decision granted entitlement to an effective date of January 20, 2022, for the service-connected disabilities of PTSD, left knee degenerative arthritis, tinnitus, and migraines, which the AOJ thereafter effectuated. See March 2025 Board Decision; March 2025 Rating Decision. Accordingly, this grant of an earlier effective date for the service-connected conditions resulted in the Veteran's overall combined disability rating increasing to 100 percent effective January 20, 2022. See, e.g., id. As such, in the March 2025 Rating Decision, the AOJ additionally granted entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of eligibility for DEA benefits based on permanent and total disability status, effective January 20, 2022. See March 2025 Rating Decision.

Consequently, entitlement to an effective date of January 20, 2022, but no earlier, for eligibility to DEA based on permanent and total disability status was already granted.

As the Veteran did not meet the criteria for permanent and total disability status until January 20, 2022, even pursuant to the determinations made herein, there is no evidence to support a finding that an effective date for eligibility to DEA prior to January 20, 2022, is warranted, for all of the reasons noted below.  As such, this matter is denied.

2. Entitlement to an effective date of January 20, 2022, but no earlier, for entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction is granted.

3. Entitlement to an effective date of January 20, 2022, but no earlier, for entitlement to special monthly compensation based on loss of use of a creative organ is granted.

4. Entitlement to an effective date of January 20, 2022, but no earlier, for entitlement to service connection for right knee degenerative arthritis with patellofemoral pain syndrome, is granted.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for the grants of service connection for erectile dysfunction and right knee degenerative arthritis with patellofemoral pain syndrome, as well as entitlement to special monthly compensation based on loss of use of a creative organ. See June 2024 VA Form 10182.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date for an award of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase, will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date that entitlement arose, whichever is later. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 3.400, 5110. Regarding the date of entitlement, the term "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statute or regulation; however, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought, which is determined on a "facts found" basis. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000).

Further, an effective date of an award of service connection is not based on the earliest medical evidence showing a causal connection, but on the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was filed with VA. See Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382 (1999). 

Moreover, for awards of secondary service connection, the effective date can be no earlier than the date of the claim for service connection on a secondary basis. See Ellington v. Nicholson, 22 Vet. App. 141, 145 (2007) (holding that "as with any other claim, the effective date assigned for a secondarily service-connected condition is governed by § 3.400."). Therefore, it follows that an effective date for secondary service connection cannot be earlier than the effective date warranted for the underlying disability upon which service connection was granted because entitlement to secondary service connection does not arise until the underlying disability is service connected. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Lastly, a specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151(a). The term "claim" or "application" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). Any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, from a Veteran or her or his representative, may be considered an informal claim. Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought. Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. If received within one year from the date it was sent to the Veteran, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

As to the claim of entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction and the associated issue of entitlement to special monthly compensation based on loss of use of a creative organ, the Board notes that the Veteran has continuously pursued his claim since April 2021. See April 2021 VA 21-526EZ. Specifically, in April 2021, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for a "penile condition" incurred in-service, and alternatively, as secondary to thyroid problems, which was denied in a June 2021 Rating Decision. See id; June 2021 Rating Decision. The Veteran subsequently filed a Request for Higher-Level Review in June of 2022, which was within the one-year period allowed to maintain continuous pursuit post-Rating Decision. See June 2022 VA Form 20-0996. The AOJ found that a duty to assist error had occurred and sought further development. See July 2022 Rating Decision; July 2022 VA Form 20-0999 Higher-Level Review Return. In November 2022, the AOJ again denied entitlement to service connection for both claims of penile condition and service connection for penile condition as secondary to thyroid condition. See November 2022 Rating Decision.

In January 2023, the Veteran again requested a Higher-Level Review of his claims. See January 2023 VA Form 20-0996. In April 2023, the AOJ again found that a duty to assist error had occurred and sought further development. See April 2023 Rating Decision; April 2023 VA Form 20-0999 Higher-Level Review Return. However, in October 2023, the AOJ granted service connection for erectile dysfunction "as related to the service-connected disability of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)," with an evaluation of zero percent, effective January 19, 2023. See October 2023 Rating Decision. Likewise, as entitlement is precipitated by the grant of service connection for erectile dysfunction, the AOJ also granted entitlement to special monthly compensation based on loss of use of a creative organ, effective January 19, 2023. See id.

The Board notes that the assignment of the effective date in the October 2023 Rating Decision was due to, at the time, the effective date for the corresponding service-connected primary disability of PTSD. See id. However, subsequent to the assignment of the January 19, 2023, effective date for the grants of entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction and special monthly compensation based on loss of use of a creative organ, a Board decision granted an earlier effective date for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD. Namely, a March 2025 Board decision granted an effective date of January 20, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for PTSD, which was effectuated by the AOJ in a subsequent Rating Decision. See March 2025 Board Decision; March 2025 Rating Decision.

Thus, although the Veteran has continuously pursued his claim of entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction since April 2021, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, the earliest possible effective date for the awards of secondary service connection can be no earlier than the date of the claim for service connection on a secondary basis. Accordingly, entitlement to an effective date of January 20, 2022, but no earlier, for entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction and special monthly compensation based on loss of use of a creative organ is warranted.

As to the claim of entitlement to service connection for right knee degenerative arthritis with patellofemoral pain syndrome, the Board notes that the Veteran first filed a claim in July 2018 seeking service connection for "knee condition, right." See July 2018 VA 21-526EZ. The AOJ denied the Veteran's claim, which became final in July 2019, as the Veteran did not request a Higher-Level Review, initiate an appeal to the Board regarding that rating decision, nor did he submit new and material evidence with respect to the issue of service connection for right knee condition. Moreover, the record contains no specific contention that evidences a previously unsubstantiated fact was submitted or received by VA in the year following the July 2019 rating decision. Accordingly, the Board finds that the July 2019 Rating Decision became final and cannot serve as a basis for the award of an earlier effective date. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 3.400, 3.156(b), 5110.

Nevertheless, on January 20, 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA 21-0966, Intent to File, and proceeded to file a Supplemental Claim for "service connection for right knee" on January 19, 2023. See January 2022 VA 21-0966; January 2023 VA Form 20-0995. The Veteran's claim was denied in an April 2023 Rating Decision; however, the AOJ subsequently found a duty to assist error had occurred and eventually granted the Veteran's claim in an August 2023 Rating Decision, assigning an effective date of January 19, 2023. See April 2023 Rating Decision; July 2023 Rating Decision; August 2023 Rating Decision.

However, as the Veteran's January 19, 2023, Supplemental Claim was received within one-year of his January 20, 2022, Intent to File, the date of receipt of said Intent to File is treated as the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim for effective date purposes, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. §3.155. 

Thus, considering the record in the light most favorable to the Veteran, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of January 20, 2022, is warranted for the awards of service connection for erectile dysfunction as well as entitlement to special monthly compensation based on loss of use of a creative organ, based on VA's receipt of an Intent to File a Claim on that date, and the Veteran's submission of formal claims for the disabilities at issue within one year of the Intent to File.

In written statement, the Veteran's attorney has contended that the Veteran is entitled to effective dates of November 26, 2021, for all disabilities on appeal, as this was the day after he separated from active service.  He argues that, because the Veteran submitted an intend to file within one year of separation and then filed his formal claim within one year of the intent to file, his effective dates should be the day after his separation.  There is no law that would permit the assignment of these effective dates.  The Veteran did file his formal claim within one year of his intent to file, but he did not file his formal claim within one year of his separation, which is required for his effective dates to be assigned from the day after separation.  There is no evidence or argument in the record to suggest otherwise.  As such, an effective date of November 26, 2021, for the disabilities at issue here, is not warranted.

Accordingly, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.155, the Veteran's complete claims are considered filed as of the date VA received his intent to file. Moreover, as detailed above, and pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, the effective date for awards of secondary service connection can be no earlier than the date of the claim for service connection on a secondary basis.

?

As such, an earlier effective date of January 20, 2022, is granted for service connection for erectile dysfunction and right knee degenerative arthritis with patellofemoral pain syndrome, as well as entitlement to special monthly compensation based on loss of use of a creative organ.
