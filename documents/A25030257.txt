ORDER

Entitlement to an increased initial disability rating of 50 percent for migraine headaches is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's migraine headaches caused very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability for the entire period on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a 50 percent rating for migraine headaches have been met for the entire period on appeal. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400(o)(2), 3.2500, 4.1, 4.3, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army National Guard from May 2004 to September 2004, October 2004 to December 2005, and November 2006 to May 2007.

The present appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeal (Board) following a May 2024 Higher-Level Review rating decision. The Veteran appealed that decision by filing a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in June 2024. He elected the Direct docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran was notified of the AOJ May 2024 decision on appeal on June 4, 2024 which is within one year of the issuance of this decision, and the opportunity to request a different Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), VA Form 10182, docket has not fully expired. See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 311 (2024). However, as the Board's decision herein represents a complete grant of the benefit sought, i.e., maximum allowable disability rating, the Board finds any error in issuing the decision prior to the expiration of that period to be harmless. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1102.

Entitlement to an increased initial disability rating for migraine headaches.

Disability evaluations are determined by comparing a Veteran's present symptoms with the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based upon average impairment in earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155 ; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher evaluation is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. §4.7. After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt is resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. §4.3.

In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991). Where, as here, entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994). Staged ratings are appropriate for any rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods during the appeal period where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 510 (2007). Here, as explained below, a uniform 50 percent rating is proper.

The Veteran's service connected headaches are evaluated under Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100, a noncompensable rating is warranted for headaches with less frequent attacks; a 10 percent rating is warranted for headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the last several months; a 30 percent rating is warranted for headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months; and a 50 percent rating is warranted for headaches with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124(a). A 50 percent evaluation is the maximum available schedular evaluation for headaches. These criteria are successive; thus, each criterion for a higher rating must be met in order to warrant such a rating. See Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 253 (2018).  

The rating criteria do not define "prostrating." Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary defines "prostration" as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness." Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1554 (31st ed. 2007). VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1) defines prostrating under DC 8100 as "causing extreme exhaustion, powerlessness, debilitation or incapacitation with substantial inability to engage in ordinary activities." M21-1, pt. III, subpt. iv, ch. 4, sec. G(7)(b). While the Adjudication Manual is not binding on the Board, DAV v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs, 859 F.3d 1072, 1077 (Fed. Cir. 2017) ("The M21-1 Manual is binding on neither the agency nor tribunals"), the Board "is required to discuss any relevant provisions contained in the M21-1 as part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases." See Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018).

While Diagnostic Code 8100 does not explicitly define the term "very frequent" for the purpose of assigning a 50 percent rating, using the criteria for 10 percent and 30 percent ratings as guideposts indicates that a veteran must experience a prostrating attack at a greater frequency of once every other month or once per month to qualify for a 50 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.  

The completely prostrating attacks must also be "prolonged," which is defined as "to lengthen in time: extend duration: draw out: continue, protract." See Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 253.

VA regulations also do not define "economic inadaptability." In Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 445 (2004), the Court examined the term "productive of severe economic inadaptability" in the criteria for a 50 percent rating under DC 8100, and noted that "[n]owhere in the DC is 'inadaptability' defined, nor can a definition be found elsewhere in title 38 of the [C.F.R.]." Id at 446. The Court explained that, "nothing in DC 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating" because "[i]f 'economic inadaptability' were read to import unemployability," a claimant who "met the economic-inadaptability criterion, would then be eligible for a rating of total disability based on individual unemployability [(TDIU)]... rather than just a 50% rating." Id. The Court therefore rejected the notion that "severe economic inadaptability" was equivalent to an inability to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation, the unemployability standard for TDIU. Id. In addition, the Court acknowledged VA's concession that the phrase "productive of severe economic inadaptability" in DC 8100 should be construed as either "producing" or "capable of producing" severe economic inadaptability. Id at 445.

In rating headaches or migraines under DC 8100, the Board may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).

In Holmes v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App.?67, 73 (2020), the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (the Court) held that Diagnostic Code 8100 contemplates all migraine symptoms. Consideration of all symptoms experienced due to migraine attacks must be evaluated based on their frequency, duration, and economic impact when evaluating migraine headaches under Diagnostic Code 8100. The Court added that the analysis under Diagnostic Code 8100 is similar to that used to assign ratings for psychiatric disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the Veteran and the claim will be granted on the merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). 

The Veteran sought private medical treatment for migraine headaches in January 2023. See April 2023 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. He endorsed experiencing headaches which limited his activities for a day or more in the previous three months. His symptoms included nausea and/or vomiting and photophobia/sensitivity to light. Additionally, he reported having floaters in his vision 10-15 minutes before the headache pain began. The frequency of his headaches were eight times a month, lasting 2-12 hours with an 8.5 out of 10 pain level. He found screen time and sunlight in the morning to be his main triggers for headaches. He was diagnosed with migraines with aura. See April 2023 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. 

The Veteran's private treatment records are consistent with his VA treatment records. In February 2023, the Veteran reported worsening migraines with symptoms of photosensitivity and nausea. See April 2023 CAPRI. He stated his migraines are alleviated if he goes into a dark room or sleeps. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination during the period on appeal in June 2023. See June 2023 C&P Exam. The VA examiner found the Veteran's symptoms contributable to a migraine including migraine variants diagnosis with onset in January 2021 as reported by the Veteran. The Veteran's reports were largely consistent with his private and VA medical treatment records. The Veteran continued to endorse a frequency of migraines eight times a month, lasting several hours with a 9 out of 10 pain level. He described his pain as a pulsating or throbbing head pain. The VA examiner found his symptoms to include vomiting, sensitivity to light, and sensitivity to sound. The Veteran found his headaches were aggravated by loud noises and bright lights. The Veteran explained that he has to lay in a dark room and take his migraine medication (Nurtec) to relieve his migraines. He reported missing work several times a month due to his migraines. The VA examiner concluded that the Veteran experiences characteristic prostrating attacks of migraines greater than once per month, with less frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraines. 

Although the June 2023 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran did not have frequent completely prostrating migraine attacks, the Board finds the Veteran's lay statements and medical records suggest otherwise. The Veteran has consistently reported that he experiences frequent migraines, as he reports his migraines occur eight times a month during the period on appeal. The Board finds the Veteran's reported migraine symptoms equate to completely prostrating attacks. The Veteran revealed during his January 2023 private medical appointment, February 2023 VA medical appointment, and his VA examination that he must lay in a dark room or sleep to alleviate the pain from his migraines. He rated his pulsating and throbbing migraine pain between 8.5 and 9 out of 10. Notably, he did not indicate that some migraines are less severe or more severe than others. Other symptoms of his migraines include nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound, and blurry vision and/or visual floaters. Moreover, the Veteran endorsed having to miss work several times a month due to his migraines. 

During the Higher-Level Review conference, the Veteran explained that he misses work because he has to lay down and cannot look at a computer. The Board finds the Veteran's statements credible as his reported symptoms are consistent throughout the record to different medical professionals. The fact that the Veteran must lay down in a dark room and take extra medication due to the severity of his migraine symptoms, to include extremely severe pain with nausea and vomiting, suggests that his migraine headaches render him entirely powerless. See Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 253. Based on the foregoing evidence and the Veteran's lay statements, the Board finds the Veteran's migraines symptoms rise to the level of very frequent completely prostrating migraine headaches. 

The Veteran's migraine headaches are also found to produce prolonged completely prostrating symptoms. The Veteran consistently reports his headaches last several hours. Specifically, he endorsed headaches lasting 2-12 hours and limiting his daily activities for a day or more in his private treatment records. The Board finds migraine headaches lasting several hours, to include up to 12 hours, meets the definition of prolonged, which is "to lengthen in time: extend duration: draw out: continue, protract." See Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 253.

Lastly, the Board finds the Veteran's migraine headaches produce severe economic inadaptability. As discussed above, the Veteran reports missing several days of work a month due to his migraine headaches. Not only must the Veteran lay down in a dark room, or even sleep, to alleviate his symptoms, but he is unable to look at a computer screen while suffering from a migraine headache due to his extreme light sensitivity. This severely impacts his work as a day trader. While he may be able to maintain self-employment as a day trader, the Board recognizes his very frequent completely prostrating migraine headaches impose a severe economic impairment as he is forced to step away from work and daily activities to alleviate his migraine headaches for several hours.

In conclusion, based on the foregoing, the Board finds the evidence is at least in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's migraine headaches caused very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. The Board therefore resolves reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran. Entitlement to the maximum schedular rating of 50 percent for migraine headaches is warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Board has considered the Veteran's claim and decided entitlement based on the evidence. Neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with respect to his claim. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
