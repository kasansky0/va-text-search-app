ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to October 23, 2019 for a rating of total disability due to individual unemployability based upon service-connected disorders (TDIU) is denied.

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to October 23, 2019 for basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability status pursuant to 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran was substantially and gainfully employed until October 22, 2019; therefore, the effective date for awarded TDIU is correctly established as the day after the last day of employment, and no earlier effective date prior to October 23, 2019 is possible for the benefit on appeal.

2. Entitlement to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 arose on October 23, 2019, coinciding with TDIU being granted and deemed effective the day after the last day of substantial and gainful employment; therefore, the effective date is correctly set and no earlier effective date prior to October 23, 2019 is possible for the benefit on appeal.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to October 23, 2019 for a rating of total disability due to individual unemployability based upon service-connected disorders (TDIU) have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.15, 4.16.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to October 23, 2019 for basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability status pursuant to 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510, 5113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807(a), 21.3021.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from June 1967 to May 1971.  The claims on appeal come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of an August 29, 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  A Higher-Level Review (HLR) rating decision on the same claims was issued on January 24, 2025.

In the March 6, 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 29, 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

As noted, the appellant selected the Direct Review Docket.  Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2), an appellant may modify a NOD to change the Board docket being requested. The time limit for such modification is "within one year from the date that the [AOJ] mails notice of the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date that the Board receives the [NOD], whichever is later." See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  "[T]he Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up." See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).  As a result of Williams, supra, the Board could normally be precluded from adjudicating this claim until August 29, 2025, which would allow for both one year after the rating decision on appeal, and also 60 days after receipt of the NOD to submit a new one.  

On March 6, 2025 (the same date as the NOD), the Veteran's attorney moved for advancement on the docket due to the Veteran's age, and she also requested "Please expedite this Veteran's claim and move forward in the adjudication process as soon as possible." See Motion to Advance on the Docket (rec'd Mar. 6, 2025).  The Board interprets this as a waiver of the remainder of the year, so the Board will assert jurisdiction now, despite any provision to the contrary from Williams, supra.  

This appeal is advanced on the docket on account of the Veteran's advanced age. 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2). 38 C.F.R. § 20.900(c). 

Earlier Effective Dates

Generally, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

For claims for higher ratings, in general, the effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if an application is received within one year from that date. Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of VA receipt of the claim for increase, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

Unless otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of increased rating shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1). The effective date of an award of increased compensation may be established at the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred if the application for an increased rating is received within one year from that date. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has explained that, in an original claim for service connection, the date entitlement arose is governed by the date the claim is received, not the date of the medical evidence submitted to support a particular claim.  See McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28 (2000). Where a prior unappealed decision becomes final and binding on a Veteran, the effective date of a subsequent award of service connection is the date of receipt of a reopened claim, not the date of receipt of the original claim. Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244 (2002); Melton v. West, 13 Vet. App. 442 (2000).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form.  The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats.  The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (now codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155).  The amendments apply to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.  

The Board has fully considered all submissions added to the claims file (for any reason) prior to March 24, 2015. See Correspondence (Mar. 19, 2013) ("Please consider this correspondence an informal claim for compensation benefits for mental health conditions, insomnia with night terrors, hypertension, arthritis, and exposure to Agent Orange herbicides.").  By way of background, TDIU was claimed (and eventually granted) as due to ischemic heart disease and PTSD. See VA Form 21-8940 (rec'd Mar. 18, 2020).  Heart disease was granted service connection in an August 2016 rating decision, see Rating Decision (Aug. 22, 2016), while PTSD was granted service connection in a March 2017 rating decision, see Rating Decision (Mar. 13, 2017).  

The Board has thoroughly inspected every submission after these rating decisions, to make sure there is no Notice of Disagreement in any form.  If there were, then the Board could then consider whether this is an initial claim continuously prosecuted since prior to March 24, 2015.  There is no such Notice of Disagreement, nor is there any written submission that could be reasonably construed as such anywhere within the claims file.  That means that these initial claims of service connection are final, along with their initial ratings, and these claims for TDIU and DEA benefits must therefore only arise out of a non-initial increased rating claim, which accordingly necessarily must have only been received in or after 2018, let alone after March 24, 2015.  The standard forms amendment accordingly applies, but the standard forms amendment does not appear to preclude any benefit that would otherwise be available to the Veteran.

Upon receipt of an intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by VA.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by VA, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

The provisions of 38 U.S.C. § 5101(a) mandate that a claim must be filed in order for any type of benefit to accrue or be paid.  See Jones v. West, 136 F.3d 1296, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 1998).  Further, the mere presence of medical evidence in the record does not establish intent on the part of the Veteran to seek service connection for the benefit in question.  Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-35 (1998). While the Board must interpret the Veteran's submissions broadly, the Board is not required to conjure up issues that were not raised by the Veteran.  Id.

The word "claim" includes a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p); Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-35 (1998); Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 199 (1992).  Any communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under laws administered by VA from a Veteran may be considered to be an informal claim.  Such an informal claim must identify the benefits sought.  Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim.  See Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992).

In this regard, as of such date, a claimant, or certain other individuals as specified in section 3.155(b), may indicate a claimant's intent to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant.  Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

While, under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.157(b)(1), the date of outpatient or hospital examination or the date of admission to a VA or uniformed services hospital will be accepted as the date of receipt of a claim, the Court has held that this regulation only applies to a defined group of claims. See Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244, 249 (2002) (section 3.157 applies to a defined group of claims, i.e., as to disability compensation, those claims for which a report of a medical examination or hospitalization is accepted as an informal claim for an increase of a service-connected rating where service connection has already been established). VA medical records cannot be accepted as an informal claim for disability where service connection has not been established. The mere presence of medical evidence does not establish intent on the part of the Veteran to seek service connection for a condition. See Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998). Merely seeking treatment does not establish a claim, to include an informal claim, for an increased rating.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), the Board is bound by earlier in time findings of fact that are favorable to the appellant. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  The HLR rating decision established that entitlements to TDIU and basic eligibility to DEA benefits are each effective October 23, 2019.  Meanwhile, the Veteran has satisfied schedular criteria for a TDIU ever since December 13, 2016, which coincides with his service-connected PTSD rated 70 percent by itself. See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.16; Rating Decision (Codesheet) (Aug. 29, 2024).

A claimant may "limit a claim or appeal to the issue of entitlement to a particular disability rating which is less than the maximum disability rating allowed by law" via "clearly expressed intent to limit the appeal to entitlement to a specific disability rating for the service-connected condition." See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35, 39 (1993) (citing Hamilton v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 528, 544 (1993)).  The Veteran and his attorney have clearly limited this appeal to earlier effective dates for TDIU and DEA benefits, if any date prior to October 23, 2019 is warranted. See VA Form 10182 (rec'd Mar. 6, 2025 ), at Part III, Question No. 11 et seq.  The Board accordingly accepts jurisdiction as limited to this argument. See generally Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board to search the record and address procedural arguments when the Veteran fails to raise them before the Board."); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).  If the Veteran and/or his attorney want to pursue a claim for increased ratings, other ancillary benefits, or literally any other claim other than the earlier effective date claims on the VA Form 10182 and on appeal herein, then they are free to file a Supplemental Claim at any time.

The Veteran and his attorney have not offered any argument as to why any earlier effective date is warranted.  Simply stated, the Veteran's last day of work was October 22, 2019, so the effective date for TDIU and DEA benefits appears to be correctly set at October 23, 2019 for both.  With no arguments or credible evidence in support of either of these claims, the Board will deny them as wholly meritless. 

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to October 23, 2019 for a rating of total disability due to individual unemployability based upon service-connected disorders (TDIU) is denied.

In general, the effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if an application is received within one year from that date.  Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of VA receipt of the claim for increase, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).  The Board received this claim for a TDIU on March 18, 2020, see VA Form 21-8940 (rec'd Mar. 18, 2020), and the claim was granted effective October 23, 2019.

Unless otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of increased rating shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1). The effective date of an award of increased compensation may be established at the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred-if the application for an increased rating is received within one year from that date.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).  

Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned when a veteran is unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.  In reaching such a determination, the central inquiry is "whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993); see Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993) (the ultimate question is whether the Veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he can find employment).  Consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience when arriving at this conclusion; factors such as age or impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities are not to be considered. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

Total disability ratings are authorized for any service-connected disability or combination of service-connected disabilities, provided the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is unable to secure and maintain substantially gainful employment because of the severity of the service-connected disabilities.  If there is only one service-connected disability, it must be rated at least 60 percent. If there are two or more disabilities, at least one must be rated at least 40 percent disabling and there must be sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to at least 70 percent.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.15, 4.16(a). Disabilities resulting from common etiology or single accident or affecting both upper and lower extremities are considered as one collective disability for the purpose of determining whether the threshold minimum rating requirements are met.

In the Veteran's VA Form 21-8940, he stated that he was employed at Universal Studios as a security guard from January 2017 until October 2019.  See VA Form 21-8940 (rec'd Mar. 18, 2020).  He appears to have worked 18 hours per week, while earning up to $1100 monthly, but he stated that he did not lose any time due to service-connected disabilities.  Universal Studios confirmed the Veteran's last day of employment as October 22, 2019.  See VA Form 21-4192 (rec'd Apr. 29, 2020).  Prior to this part-time employment, the Veteran was employed full-time at BMW, in a different state other than Florida. See VA Form 21-8940, supra.

Although no argument has been advanced with respect to the Veteran's employment in a "protected environment," the Board has nonetheless seriously considered the potential applicability of a recent Federal holding, LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111 (2024), where it was held that employment in a "protected environment" means a lower-income position that, due to the Veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market.  This definition contemplates workplace accommodations required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as "employees who receive reasonable accommodations under the ADA are not being shielded from the competitive labor market; they are working within it under one of the conditions that govern it." LaBruzza, supra.  Factors that adjudicators should assess in determining whether employment is in a protected environment include: (1) nature and extent of accommodations; (2) employer behavior (e.g.: vet-friendly or family business); and (3) economic (e.g.: for profit business vs not for profit). See Arline v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 238, 250-52 (2021) (Bartley, J., dissenting).  The Arline dissent offered a set of three non-exclusive factors to aid in assessing the meaning of that phrase: (1) the type and extent of accommodations the veteran receives from an employer; (2) the behavior and intent of an employer toward the veteran; and (3) the compensation received by the veteran, with a high income potentially weighing against a protected environment and an income that only marginally exceeds the poverty threshold potentially weighing in favor of protected employment. Id. at 259-61.

Additionally, the Court has stated that "a veteran can establish marginal employment either by demonstrating an income less than the poverty threshold established by the U.S. Census Bureau or by the facts of [the] particular case." See Ortiz-Valles v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 65, 71 (2016) (emphasis in original). However, a veteran receiving the same pay as similarly situated coworkers who are not disabled, for example, is a factor relevant to whether the veteran is employed in a protected environment. Cantrell v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 382, 390 (2017) (concurrence)

With respect to the first Arline factor, type and extent of accommodations received, the Veteran states that he did not lose any time to illness.  It would strain credulity that a large employer such as Universal Studios would afford such drastic accommodations if the Veteran could not perform essential functions as a security guard, because then, Universal Studios presumably would have hired a new security guard to replace the Veteran.  The Board determines that this part-time job was not protected employment.

With respect to the second Arline factor, the behavior and intent of an employer towards the Veteran, the House of Representatives, Committee on Veterans' Affairs is an employer that without question has benevolent intent in hiring veterans, including disabled veterans. However, the inquiry does not end with establishing benevolence. The Arline dissent noted that where protected employment exists, employer behavior "may indicate that the veteran is shielded from the consequences of nonperformance or poor performance of job duties." Arline, 34 Vet. App. at 261.  Examples of employers that may offer protected employment included institutional employers such as "a hospital, VA domiciliary, or long-term care institution, where the goal of employment may be charitable or rehabilitative" and the employer may be "more likely to offer employment in a protected environment than a for-profit employer." Id.

Based on these guidelines, the Board's interpretation is that in most if not all protected employment situations, the most important factor would be the benefits flowing to the protected employee.  As the primary goal is the rehabilitation of or charity towards the employee, the employer would be willing to tolerate flaws that made the proposition of employment a "losing proposition" from the perspective of a traditional for-profit employer.

Thus, benevolence towards disabled veterans is not, standing alone, sufficient to establish protected employment.  An organization may give preference in hiring to a disabled veteran and allow generous accommodations. However, an employee who is at risk of being fired after failing to meet some minimum standard notwithstanding this benevolence is very likely not a protected employee.

The evidence of record establishes that the Veteran was hired as a part-time security guard at Universal Studios, until his last day on October 22, 2019.  There is no competent or credible evidence that Universal Studios or the Veteran's supervisor appreciated that the Veteran could only perform limited, casual labor that did not interfere with service-connected disabilities.  The Board is determining that due to Universal Studios' capitalistic motivations in employing its security force, the Veteran's employment was just part-time, but not protected, because Universal Studios would not have employed him out of sheer benevolence.  It would strain credulity to suggest that Universal Studios would enter into an employment arrangement that would otherwise appear to be a "losing proposition" from any other traditional for-profit employer.  

Turning to the third Arline factor, the compensation received, the 2017 poverty threshold for one person is $12,060; 2018, $12,140; 2019, $12,490.  For all of these years in which he was employed at Universal Studios, the Veteran appears to have exceeded the poverty threshold despite part-time hours of 18 hours per week.  Barely exceeding the poverty threshold with part-time wages and other benefits does not render the Veteran ineligible for a TDIU; however, the Board is concluding that if the Veteran would have wanted full-time work, he could have earned even more money.  For the hours that the Veteran did work, his base pay was $12.08 (twelve dollars and eight cents) per hour, then $12.61 (twelve dollars and sixty-one cents) per hour, and then finally $13.89 (thirteen dollars and eighty-nine cents) per hour. See VA Form 21-4192 (rec'd Apr. 29, 2020), at Pages 2-8 of 8.  Finally, there is some evidence of his earning "casual holiday premium pay" on two occasions, and overtime pay on one other occasion.  See id. at Pages 3 and 6 of 8.  

For all of the reasons above, the Board is determining that there is no evidence of any accommodations to the Veteran, and that Universal Studios employed the Veteran as a security guard for capitalistic reasons-not benevolent reasons.  The lack of accommodations outweighs any findings pertaining to compensation earned, and there is no argument that the Veteran's base pay was lower than other security guards in "non-protected" employment.  That being said, any argument about the Veteran's relatively small income would still be persuasively outweighed by the Veteran earning holiday pay and overtime pay, on top of hourly rates ranging from $12.08 to $13.89 in base pay.  It would strain credulity to believe that Universal Studios would benevolently employ the Veteran in a protected status, but still allow him to work holiday and overtime shifts as a security guard. See Cantrell, supra.

As a result of all of the above evidence of record, the Veteran's employment at Universal Studios as a security guard, albeit at part-time hours, precludes entitlement to a TDIU.  The employer confirmed his last day as October 22, 2019, and they also corroborated the Veteran's estimate of working 18 hours weekly, with some holiday and overtime pay-all via a leave and earnings statement.  See VA Form 21-4192 (rec'd Apr. 29, 2020).  The Veteran's part-time schedule is not merely casual labor in a protected environment, there is no competent or credible evidence of any job accommodation (let alone accommodations that excuse performance of core functions), the Veteran appears to have been treated equally among the hired security guards (with two holiday pay shifts and one overtime shift), and the Veteran's job appeared to be capitalistic in nature (culminating in his last day of work), instead of out of sheer benevolence on the part of Universal Studios.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to report the symptoms of his disabilities.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007) (lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 14, 2009).  That being said, the Veteran was substantially and gainfully employed until October 22, 2019, and there is no competent or credible evidence anywhere in the record to suggest that he is entitled to a TDIU any earlier than October 23, 2019, which is at once the first day after his last day of employment, and also already the effective date for his TDIU.  The Veteran and his attorney have proffered no argument as to which earlier effective date should be warranted, and the Board similarly determines that there is no further entitlement available on this meritless claim. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (where the law, not the evidence, is dispositive, the appeal should be terminated for lack of legal merit or entitlement).  

The claim for an earlier effective date prior to October 23, 2019, for the Veteran's TDIU already in effect thereafter, is hereby DENIED, and because the evidence is persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine simply does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).     

2. Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to October 23, 2019 for basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability status pursuant to 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 is denied.

Eligibility for DEA benefits requires an underlying service-connected disability that is both total and permanent in nature.  38 U.S.C. § 3501(a)(1)(A)(ii), (D)(i); see 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807(a)(1)-(2), 21.3021(a)(1)(iii), (3)(i).  As delineated above, the Veteran's claim for a TDIU was previously adjudicated as warranted, but only effective October 23, 2019.  With TDIU having been set as effective October 23, 2019, that date is also the effective date for basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance, based on permanent and total disability status pursuant to 38 U.S.C. chapter 35.

The Board sees no pre-decisional error in violation of any duty to assist in the AOJ's adjudication therein, and the Board has denied the claim on appeal for any earlier effective date.  There is no other competent or credible evidence of record to suggest that any one disability was permanent and total any earlier than that date, and the Board accepts the Veteran's employment at Universal Studios as extremely persuasive evidence against any such earlier finding.  For all of these reasons, there is no competent or credible evidence to suggest that the award of basic eligibility for DEA benefits should be effective earlier than as already awarded: October 23, 2019.  The claim is DENIED accordingly.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (where the law, not the evidence, is dispositive, the appeal should be terminated for lack of legal merit or entitlement).  Because the evidence is persuasively against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine simply does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).
