REMANDED

Whether the character of the Appellant's discharge from service constitutes a bar to the receipt of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Appellant served on active duty with the United States Army from August 1969 to June 1971; this character of this service is the subject of this appeal.

The administrative decision on appeal was issued by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in August 2022; the Appellant requested Higher-Level Review of that decision, which resulted in a denial issued in April 2023.  In a timely VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal) received in April 2024, the Appellant elected the Direct Review option for this appeal.  Therefore, the Board may consider only the evidence in the record at the time of the August 2022 AOJ decision.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

1. Whether the character of the Appellants discharge constitutes a bar to the receipt of VA benefits is remanded.

Establishing status as a veteran is a threshold element in all claims for VA benefits.  See 38 U.S.C. § 101(2); see also D'Amico v. West, 209 F.3d 1322, 1326 (2000).  Enrollment in VA healthcare is likewise predicated upon status as a veteran eligible for service-connected disability.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(2), 1705, 1710.  

The August 2022 administrative decision on appeal concluded that the Appellant's discharge is dishonorable for VA purposes, as it was due to willful and persistent misconduct.  

In December 2023, the Appellant also appealed an administrative decision denying him enrollment in the VA healthcare system based on the character of his discharge from service.  In that case, the Board found that the character of the Appellant's discharge was within its jurisdiction, and further found that remand was necessary for a new character of discharge determination.  The Board remand was issued on March 12, 2025, and the development has not yet been completed.

The Board finds the subject matter of this appeal is inextricably intertwined with the VA healthcare appeal, which was recently remanded, as both appeals contemplate the same central issue:  the character of the Appellant's discharge from service.  See Henderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 11, 20 (1998); Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991).  Therefore, a remand is also necessary in this appeal to await the new character of discharge determination.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matter is REMANDED.
