ORDER

The issue as to whether an overpayment in the total amount of $1,338.29, for Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) benefits under Chapter 31, Title 38 United States Code, was validly created is REMANDED.  

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from May 1996 to September 1996 and on active duty in the United States Army from August 1999 to May 2003.  The Veteran had additional service with the United States Marine Corps Reserve. 

The case is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2021 decision by the Baltimore, Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) VR&E Regional Office (RO).  The decision notified the Veteran of an overpayment of subsistence allowance benefits under VR&E benefits. 

In the February 2021 Notice of Disagreement (NOD or VA Form 10182), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).     

REASONS FOR REMAND

Whether an overpayment in the\amount of $1,338.29, for VR&E benefits is valid

The provisions of Chapter 31 are intended to enable veterans with service-connected disabilities to achieve maximum independence in daily living and, to the maximum extent feasible, to become employable and to obtain and maintain suitable employment. 38 C.F.R. § 21.1.  For a veteran with 20 percent disability or more, basic entitlement to Chapter 31 benefits requires that the veteran be found by VA to need rehabilitation because of an employment handicap. 38 C.F.R. § 21.40(b).  Once found eligible, VR&E services include counseling and supervision, payment of tuition/fees/books/ supplies, and monthly subsistence allowance while in training.

By way of background, the Veteran applied, and was found eligible to receive VR&E benefits to obtain and/or maintain suitable employment in the occupational goal of Computer Software Engineering.   As part of the VR&E plan to achieve his goal, the Veteran enrolled, in pertinent part, at the Hagerstown Community College.    On July 30, 2020, the VR&E office approved the Veteran's subsistence allowance while pursuing such training at the $942.44 rate per month for the 2020 Fall term running from October 21, 2020 to December 15, 2020, for 6 credit hours.  The record does not contain any additional evidence with respect to the school term in question, to include notification of changes in the student status during his enrollment. 

In February 2021, the VR&E office issued the decision currently on appeal, notifying the Veteran that according to Hagerstown Community College, he completely withdrew from training on November 3, 2020.  As a result, his subsistence allowance benefit was stopped effective that date creating an overpayment in the total calculated amount of $1,338.29.   The notification further explains to the Veteran that pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 21.324(i)(2)(vii), veterans are entitled to a one-time forgiveness for withdrawals of up to six credit hours without a requirement to provide the reason for training reduction or complete withdrawal.  The notification continues to explain that "the six-credit hour exclusion applies in the first instance of reduction or withdrawal from training during [the] rehabilitation program.  This means that subsistence allowance for the six credits will be paid until the last day of the term for complete withdrawal, or the last day of the term or training for partial reduction in the training hours even if there were no mitigating circumstances."      

In the February 2021 VA Form 10182, the Veteran, conversely, indicates that he did not withdraw from school on November 3, 2020, as allegedly reported by the school, but after the school term was completed on December 15, 2020.   

The Board has reviewed the evidence of record and for the reasons set forth below, finds that a remand is necessary prior to adjudication of the matter on the merits. 

First, the record does not contain any evidence showing when and how Hagerstown Community College reported to the VR&E office that the Veteran fully withdrew from his enrollment on November 3, 2020.  As noted previously, the Veteran also contends that he did not withdraw from school as a student until after the term was completed.  In other words, the evidence before the Board consists of facts that are contradictory to each other without any evidence for the Board to assess the information.  Thus, further clarification in that regard is necessary prior to adjudication of the appeal. 

Second, review of the record shows that the Veteran first applied for VR&E benefits in 2019 and enrolled in school as part of his plan to achieve his occupational goal in the 2020 Spring and Summer terms, which the record shows as successfully completed.  Thus, the 2020 Fall term appears to be his first instance of withdrawal and, therefore, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 21.324(i)(2)(vii) are seem potentially applicable to the facts of this case.  As explained above, the Veteran enrolled for 6-credit hours for the school term from October 21, 2020 to December 15, 2020.  If the Board were to conclude that the Veteran in effect withdrew on November 3, 2020, his reduction of the full 6 credit hours would have been considered as under mitigating circumstances pursuant to applicable regulation and his subsistence allowance would have ceased at the end of the month or the end of the term in which the veteran withdrew, whichever is earlier. 38 C.F.R. § 21.324(i)(1)(i).  However, at this junction the Board is prevented from rendering an opinion since the question regarding the exact date that the Veteran withdrew from enrollment requires clarification on remand.  

Lastly, if the Board were to determine that the Veteran in fact withdrew from his enrollment on November 3, 2020, the record does not contain any evidence that could serve as guidance to the Board to understand how the overpayment in question and its amount was calculated.  The record does not contain a Chapter 31 payment history nor an overpayment calculation, to include evidence demonstrating that the Veteran was properly notified of how the AOJ determined he was liable for repayment of the overpayment in the amount of $1,338.29.  

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.802 (a), the Board may remand a matter for correction of a pre-decisional error by the RO in fulfilling the duty to assist or any error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, no matter when made, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim.

Decisions of the Board must be based on a de novo review of the evidence of record at the time of the decision on the issue or issues on appeal, and any additional evidence considered as part of the evidentiary record. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104 (d), 7113; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (a).   

       

In this case, the Board concludes that the AOJ failed to satisfy a statutory or regulatory duty by not associating with the claims file documentation showing when and how Hagerstown Community College notified the VR&E office that the Veteran had withdrawn from his enrollment, to include the circumstances documented by the school.  Second, the AOJ also failed to associate with the claims file documentation showing how the overpayment was calculated, and whether the Veteran was properly notified to that effect.  Lastly, it is not clear whether the provisions set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 21.324(i)(2)(vii) were applied to the facts of this case as suggested by the February 2021 decision and, if so, the manner in which it was applied considering that the Veteran's enrollment precisely consisted of 6 credit hours. 

Thus, for the reasons set forth above, the Board concludes that a remand is warranted to cure the errors. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.801 (a), 20.802(a).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:       

1. Associate with the claims file the communication from Hagerstown Community College notifying the VR&E office that the Veteran completely withdrew from his enrollment from the school term from October 2020 to December 2020.  

2. Obtain clarification from the school with respect to the Veteran's contentions that he did not withdraw as a student until after the school term was over on December 15, 2020.  All efforts to obtain this evidence must be documented and associated with the claims file.  

3. Once the above information has been obtained and associated with the claims file, adjudicate the Veteran's claim by considering the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 21.324(i)(2)(vii) if the Veteran's withdrawal is confirmed to have occurred before the end of the term.
