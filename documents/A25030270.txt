DOCKET NO. 240619-448641
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Service connection for a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's TBI began during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for a TBI are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty in the U.S. Army from February 1981 to May 1987. He also had a period of active duty training (ADT) in the Army National Guard (ARNG) from November 1978 to March 1979 that is now considered active service.

This case comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 decision of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) that denied service connection for a TBI.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

In a March 2024 Board decision issued under the legacy appeals system, the Board granted service connection for a headache condition. The AOJ effectuated the Board's decision in a March 2024 rating decision, and granted service connection for migraine headaches, effective July 25, 2016.

1. Service connection for a TBI

The Veteran asserts that he had a head injury during basic training in February 1979, when he slipped and fell, and was rendered unconscious. See his June 2023 claim, and his reported history at the December 2023 VA TBI examination. 

He previously asserted that after the in-service head injury, he was treated at the Fort Sill emergency room, where the concussion protocol was activated, and he had headaches since that incident. See his November 2017 notice of disagreement, October 2018 substantive appeal, and his reported history at the March 2021 VA headache examination.

The Board concludes that the Veteran has a current disability that began during a period of active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

VA treatment records show the Veteran has a current diagnosis of TBI with chronic post-traumatic headaches. See, e.g. VA outpatient treatment records dated in September 2020, May 2021, June 2023, and December 2023. During service, the Veteran was seen for complaints of headaches. 

The AOJ has made multiple attempts to obtain additional service treatment records relating to the claimed head injury in 1979. Voluminous service treatment records have been obtained and associated with the claims file, including records of inpatient treatment for other conditions. The Veteran's service treatment records are negative for a head injury or a TBI. 

However, in a March 2024 Board decision, the Board conceded that the Veteran had a head injury with a concussion and a loss of consciousness in service, based on the Veteran's reported history in his November 2017 notice of disagreement. This favorable finding is binding on the Board, as it has not been rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 20.801(a).

Thus, the question becomes whether the current disability is related to service. On this question there are probative opinions in favor of and against the claim.

The evidence against the claim includes the opinion of the January 2024 VA examiner, who found no current diagnosis of a TBI following December 2023 examination of the Veteran, and noted that medical records regarding the February 1979 head injury could not be found. The examiner opined that the claimed TBI was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. The rationale was that the Veteran's service treatment records do not report a head injury or blast exposures associated with signs and/or symptoms of a TBI.

The evidence in favor of the claim includes a May 2021 VA physical medicine and rehab consult TBI initial consult note in which the Veteran reported that in February 1979, he slipped on ice and hit his head on the ground with a loss of consciousness for an unknown duration, but he thought it may have been around 30 minutes. The diagnostic assessment was chronic migraine headaches (beginning several months after his mild TBI). The medical provider stated that the Veteran's given history was consistent with a mild TBI secondary to a fall from standing height in 1979. In a December 2023 VA medical opinion, the examiner opined that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's headache condition resulted from the closed head injury with loss of consciousness in or around 1979. The examiner noted that the headache condition is well-documented in the claims file.

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's current TBI is related to service. As the evidence is in approximate balance, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is applicable, and the claim for service connection for TBI is granted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
