ORDER

Service connection for right ankle condition is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to October 20, 2021, for the grant of service connection for radiculopathy in the right lower extremity is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to October 20, 2021, for the grant of service connection for lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to October 20, 2021, for the award of a 20 percent evaluation of lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's right ankle condition is related to service.

2. A duplicate Intent to File (ITF) was received on August 27, 2021, and has no bearing on benefit entitlement. VA first received the Veteran's supplemental claim for service connection for radiculopathy in the right lower extremity disability on October 20, 2021.

3. A duplicate ITF was received on August 27, 2021, and has no bearing on benefit entitlement. VA first received the Veteran's supplemental claim for service connection for lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease disability on October 20, 2021.

4. Veteran's supplemental claim of service connection for lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease disability was received October 20, 2021, and there is no legal basis to award an effective date prior to that date for the award of a 20 percent evaluation for lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease disability.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for right ankle condition have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to October 20, 2021, for the grant of service connection for radiculopathy in the right lower extremity have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.400.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to October 20, 2021, for the grant of service connection for lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5101, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from April 1985 to January 1995. The Board recognizes the Veteran's lengthy service to his country and the sacrifices it entailed. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denying service connection for a right ankle condition and an effective date prior to October 20, 2021 for the grant of service connection for radiculopathy in the right lower extremity, lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease, and the grant of an evaluation of 20 percent for lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease disability.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may consider only the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Service connection for right ankle condition is granted.

The Veteran contends that his right ankle condition is related to service to include as secondary to his service-connected orthopedic conditions. See February 2023 Correspondence.

Service connection may be granted for a current disability that began during active duty. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection generally requires competent evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and in-service injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The first element of service connection, a current disability is met. The May 2023 rating decision concedes the Veteran has a current disability.

The second element of service connection is also met. The Veteran's service treatment records show complaints of right ankle pain. See Service Treatment Records. Additionally, the May 2023 rating decision concedes that the evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service.

The Board further finds the Veteran's current disability of the right ankle is related to service.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in February 2022. The examiner concluded that the claimed condition was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. The examiner explained that there is no mention of right ankle pain in the span of 30 years, therefore he is unable to establish chronicity for right ankle condition. See February 2022 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ).

The Board finds that this opinion is inadequate. The examiner notes that the Veteran's condition is not related to service because there is no evidence of chronicity in the record, but the examiner did not address the etiology of the Veteran's condition. The examiner also did not provide the necessary foundation for concluding the absence of evidence is relevant in determining whether the Veteran's right ankle condition is related to service. See Dalton v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (finding that a medical opinion based solely on the absence of documentation in the record is inadequate and a medical opinion is inadequate if it does not consider the Veteran's reports of symptoms and history); McKinney v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 15, 30-31 (2016) (citing cases finding medical examinations that ignore lay evidence to be inadequate). See also, Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 272 (2015) (an inference that absence of evidence is tantamount to evidence of absence requires a proper foundation supporting that conclusion under the circumstances).

When adjudicating appeals, the Board applies an intentionally generous standard of proof unique in American jurisprudence, created in recognition of the nation's great debt to its veterans. Wise v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 517, 531 (2014).

"Reasonable doubt" exists when the evidence does not "satisfactorily prove or disprove the claim." Emphasis added. A veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence on any issue material to the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Thus, when the evidence in favor of the veteran on a given issue is at least nearly equal to the evidence against them, the Board finds in the veteran's favor. See, e.g., Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021); Mattox v. McDonough, 56 F.4th 1369, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

In this instance, the Veteran was involved in a motor vehicle accident while in service and sustained injuries to his right ankle. Service treatment records also note that the Veteran sprained his right ankle twice while in service. A right ankle x-ray from service revealed mild soft tissue swelling over the medial malleolus. Moreover, during service the Veteran sustained an injury to his wrist, which required reconstruction with a right foot graft. See Service Treatment Records. The Veteran was discharged from service in January 1995. Shortly thereafter, a VA examination from February 1995, show complaints of right ankle pain since the Veteran's surgery. The Veteran reported that his ankle was weak. See February 1995 VA examination.

Although the record does not show significant treatment for his symptoms in the years after service, the record also does not show that the Veteran experienced any subsequent injuries to his right ankle. Thus, where the negative nexus opinion is of limited probative value due to inadequate analysis and explanation, there is no evidence of any intervening cause, and the Veteran's contentions are inherently plausible, internally consistent, and uncontroverted by contradictory evidence, the Board finds the benefit of the doubt must be given to the Veteran.

Lay evidence-including post hoc statements from the Veteran-may be sufficient to establish any element of service connection, including the causal nexus between an injury and a disability. See February 2019 VA Form 21-526EZ; Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for the Veteran's right ankle condition.

The appeal is granted.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to October 20, 2021, for the grant of service connection for radiculopathy in the right lower extremity is denied.

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to October 20, 2021, for the grant of service connection for lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease is denied.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an earlier effective date for his service-connected radiculopathy in the right lower extremity and lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease. Specifically, the Veteran contends that his effective date should be August 27, 2021, the date the Veteran submitted an ITF form, which the Veteran's representative indicates is an informal claim. See February 2023 Correspondence; May 2024 VA Form 10182.

As a preliminary matter, the Board considered whether the August 27, 2021, ITF could be considered an informal claim. For the reasons discussed below, the Board finds it does not.

Prior to March 24, 2015, an "informal claim" included any written request for a determination of entitlement. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). However, on March 24, 2015, VA amended its adjudication regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the claim arises. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014). These amendments apply to all claims and appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015. As the Veteran's lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease and right lower extremity radiculopathy claims were received after March 24, 2015, the Veteran's ITF is not considered an informal claim.

Next, the Board considered whether the record supports a finding of an earlier effective date. In assigning effective dates, the general rule is the effective date of a claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

In this case, the Veteran initially submitted a claim of lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease in January 1995, which was denied in a September 1995 rating decision. 

No additional evidence pertinent to the issue was physically or constructively associated with the claims folder within one year of issuance of notice of the rating decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (b); Bond v. Shinseki, 659 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2011); see also Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242, 251-52 (2010). Thus, the September 1995 rating decision became final based on the evidence then of record. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1105.

In November 2013, the Veteran submitted an informal claim for service connection of lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease, which was again denied in a September 2014 rating decision. The Veteran filed a notice of disagreement (NOD) in February 2015 and the AOJ issued a statement of the case (SOC) in April 2015. However, the Veteran did not perfect his appeal by filing a formal appeal after issuance of the SOC. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.20, 19.21, 19. Therefore, the September 2014 rating decision became final. 

On April 26, 2021, the Veteran submitted an ITF. See April 2021 Notification Letter. The Veteran submitted a second ITF form on August 27, 2021.

The Board notes that a duplicate ITF submitted for the same benefit during the active period will have no effect on benefit entitlement. That is, "VA will not recognize more than one ITF concurrently for the same benefit (e.g., compensation, pension). 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(6). In other words, only the April 26, 2021, ITF was valid.

The Veteran's April 26, 2021, ITF was associated with his increased rating claims for migraines and the right wrist received on October 18, 2021. Once an ITF is associated with a claim, it cannot also be associated with a claim received at a later date, even if it was received within one year of the date the ITF was received. 

On October 20, 2021, the Veteran submitted a supplemental claim for his lumbar spine disorder which was granted in a March 2022 rating decision. A separate rating for right lower extremity radiculopathy was granted with the same effective date.

Thus, after review of the record, the Board does not find that an earlier effective date is warranted as the earliest effective date supported by law has already been assigned. This appeal is denied.

4. Entitlement to an effective date prior to October 20, 2021, for the award of a 20 percent evaluation for lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease is denied.

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date prior to October 20, 2021, for the award of the 20 percent evaluation for his service connected lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease disability. See May 2024 VA Form 10182.

Generally, the effective date of a disability rating will be the date the veteran filed the underlying claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1). 

When a veteran files a separate claim for an increased rating (as opposed to an appeal of an initial rating), the VA provides them with a one-year "grace period" i.e., if the veteran files their claim within one year after an increase in the severity of a disability becomes "factually discernible," the effective date of the increased rating will be the date the increase in severity became discernible. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). The increase in severity may be factually discernible based on the veteran's own observations, medical tests or examinations, or any other source of evidence. See e.g., DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 58 (2011) (when determining the date a disability manifested, "all facts" should be considered).

Here, however, this is an initial increased rating claim. The Veteran was granted service connection for his lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease in a March 2022 rating decision, which granted a 10 percent rating with an effective date of October 20, 2021. The Veteran submitted a higher-level-review in February 2023 and in a May 2023 rating decision, the AOJ increased the Veteran's award to a 20 percent evaluation. 

Thus, the Veteran's appeal for an earlier effective date for the award of the 20 percent evaluation stems from an initial claim. As such, there is no legal basis for assigning an effective date prior to October 20, 2021, for the grant of the 20 percent evaluation for his lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease disability.

This appeal is denied.
