ORDER

The appeal with respect to entitlement to service connection for a left ankle disability is dismissed. 

FINDING OF FACT

By correspondence received in September 2024, prior to the promulgation of an appellate decision, the Veteran indicated that he wished to withdraw the present appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from March 2016 to April 2020. His decorations include the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2021 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office. The Veteran timely appealed to the Board by submitting a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)) in July 2022, selecting the hearing review option. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 20.202(b)(2).

The Board notes that the Veteran executed a VA Form 21-22 (Appointment of Veterans Service Organization as Claimant's Representative) in favor of Disabled American Veterans (DAV) in June 2023. However, no one from DAV signed the form. Consequently, the attempted appointment is invalid, and the Board will continue to recognize Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, who he previously appointed, as his current representative. See 38 C.F.R. § 14.631(a)(1) (mandating that a VA appellant's power of attorney be signed by the representative).

The appeal with respect to entitlement to service connection for a left ankle disability is dismissed.

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Only an appellant, or an appellant's authorized representative, may withdraw an appeal. Id.

Appeal withdrawals must include the name of the veteran, the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran (e.g., a veteran's survivor, a guardian, or a fiduciary appointed to receive VA benefits on an individual's behalf), the applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. Id.

In September 2024, prior to the promulgation of an appellate decision, VA received correspondence from the Veteran indicating that he wished to withdraw the present appeal. See September 2024 statement ("I want to withdraw my appeal at the [B]oard."). The correspondence included the Veteran's name and VA file number. Under the circumstances, the Board finds that the requirements for a proper withdrawal have been satisfied.

As the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal, there remain no allegations of error of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed.
