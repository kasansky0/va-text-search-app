ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, as secondary to service-connected bilateral hammertoes, bilateral plantar warts, and tinea pedis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the probative medical evidence of record reflects that the chronic pain associated with the Veteran's service-connected bilateral foot condition aggravates his unspecified depressive disorder.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, as secondary to service-connected bilateral hammertoes, bilateral plantar warts, and tinea pedis, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from August 1973 to January 1975.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a July 2022 Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). In the July 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 SSOC, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the July 2022 SSOC and prior to receipt of the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

The Veteran seeks service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder as secondary to other service-connected disabilities. Specifically, the Veteran contends that that the chronic pain associated with his service-connected bilateral foot condition aggravates his unspecified depressive disorder.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to, or the result of, a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a). Secondary service connection may also be established for a disorder which is aggravated by a service-connected disability; compensation may be provided for the degree of disability (but only that degree) over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b); Allen v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 374 (1995).

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). In order to prevail in a secondary service connection claim, the record must show: (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) medical nexus evidence establishing a connection between the service-connected disability and the current disability. See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998); see also Allen, 8 Vet. App. at 374.

In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the claimant prevailing in either event. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

This case has a long procedural history as follows. The Veteran originally filed a claim of entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in October 2013 which was denied in a December 2013 rating decision. The Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) in January 2014 but withdrew the appeal in April 2014. In December 2024 the Veteran again filed an NOD reinstating the appeal and requested the decision review officer (DRO) process. A DRO hearing was held on June 8, 2015. Following DRO, a statement of the case (SOC) was issued in November 2015 which continued the denial. The Veteran filed a VA Form 9 in January 2016 and requested a hearing in front of a Veterans' Law Judge (VLJ).

Prior to a hearing being held, the Veteran filed a separate claim of entitlement to service connection for depression in January 2017 which was denied in a January 2017 rating decision. In December 2017 the Veteran filed an NOD to that decision and an SOC was issued in April 2018. The Veteran filed a VA form 9 in June 2018 but this time did not request a hearing. 

In May 2021 the Board combined the Veteran's PTSD claim with the depression claim and recharacterized them into a single claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder under the holding in Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009). The Board then remanded the matter to afford the Veteran a new VA examination. Unfortunately, the Veteran was incarcerated at that time and despite numerous exam requests, the Veteran was not available to undergo a VA examination. 

However, when the Board remanded the matter in May 2021 it was aware of the Veteran's incarceration and provided for an alternative should the Veteran not be available for an in-person examination, finding that a VA medical opinion alone would suffice. Despite the Board's guidance, the AOJ failed to request a VA medical opinion based on a review of the claims file after determining that the Veteran was unavailable for an in-person examination. Instead, a supplemental statement of the case (SSOC) was issued continuing the denial of the claim.

A remand by the Board confers on the claimant a legal right to compliance with the remand order. Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268, 271 (1998). Failure of the Board to ensure compliance with remand instructions constitutes error and warrants the vacating of a subsequent Board decision. Id. However, only "substantial" compliance with the remand order is required, not strict compliance. Donnellan v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 167, 176 (2010); Dyment v. West, 13 Vet. App. 141, 147 (1999). Following the May 2021 Board remand and determination that the Veteran was unavailable for an in-person examination, the AOJ did not request or obtain a VA medical opinion based on the record as directed. As such, the AOJ failed to "substantially comply" with the Board's remand directives. Stegall, 11 Vet. App. at 271. 

However, the Court in Stegall added that if the Board determines that it can proceed to adjudicate a claim without full AOJ compliance with instructions in a prior Board remand, the Board should provide reasons and bases as to why the AOJ's failure to comply with prior remand instructions did not constitute "prejudicial error." Id.

As the Board grants the claim in full below, the Board finds that the AOJ's error constitutes harmless error, but not prejudicial error. See Shinseki v. Sanders, 556 U.S. 396, 406-07 (2009) (an error should not be presumed prejudicial and the burden of showing harmful error rests with the party raising the issue, to be determined on a case-by-case basis); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1102 (2019) (an error or defect in a Board decision that does not affect the merits of the issue or substantive rights of the appellant will be considered harmless). An error is prejudicial when it "affects a substantive right that a statutory or regulatory provision was designed to protect" and "affects the essential fairness of the adjudication." Overton v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 427, 434-35 (citing McDonough Power Equip. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 553 (1984)). An appellant generally bears the burden of demonstrating the prejudicial effect of an error. Sanders, 556 U.S. at 409-11; Simmons v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 267, 280 (2018).

In this case, the AOJ's failure to obtain a VA medical opinion was harmless because a review of the claims file reveals that the Veteran submitted a private medical opinion providing the Board with all the necessary information to fully adjudicate the claim. Thus, the basis for the May 2021 Board remand, that being to obtain a medical opinion determining the nature and etiology of his claimed acquired psychiatric disorder is unnecessary.

Turning to the evidence, the only VA medical opinion of record is from a compensation and pension (C&P) examination the Veteran underwent in June 2015. The Board discussed this VA exam briefly in the May 2021 remand but did not make a determination on its probative value. Instead, the Board determined that remand was needed to obtain additional opinion and rationale on the claim, specifically, with regard to the Veteran's claimed PTSD. As such, the Board will now make such a determination.

In June 2015 the Veteran underwent an in-person examination to determine the etiology of the Veteran's diagnosed depressive disorder. While the examiner opined that the claimed condition was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness, the rationale merely states that the examiner could not relate the etiology to the Veteran's service 40 years ago due to the Veteran's then recent discontinuance of polysubstance abuse. The examiner provided no further explanation for the opinion beyond the mere passage of time.

As such, the Board finds the June 2015 medical opinion inadequate to decide the claim. In that regard, the examiner did not provide adequate supporting rationale for the conclusions reached. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008). In addition, the examiner did not adequately address the Veteran's statements and contentions regarding the onset and continuity of his symptoms. In addition, the Board finds the June 2021 VA medical opinion is inadequate to decide the claim because the VA examiner seems to rely solely on the lack of diagnoses during active service when rendering the opinions. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007). This opinion is therefore afforded little, if any, probative weight.

In July 2022, within the 90-day evidence submission period, the Veteran submitted a private medical opinion rendered by a private psychologist in June 2021. After a review of the record, the private examiner determined that the Veteran was diagnosed with unspecified depressive disorder in 2012; thus, the first element of service connection has been met. After an interview of the Veteran and a review of the claims file, the private examiner opined that it is more likely than not that the pain associated with the Veteran's service-connected bilateral foot condition aggravates his depression. As rationale, the examiner explained that while there are many situational factors that contribute to the Veteran's depression, it is well-established that chronic pain and depression co-occur and interact with each other through shared pathophysiology. 

The private doctor explained that patients with both a mental illness and chronic pain experience increased psychiatric symptoms on account of the pain. Lastly, the examiner cited to a clinical journal of pain article for support which found that the comorbidities and bidirectional relationships that exist between chronic pain, depression, and sleep disturbances are well recognized clinically; and that all three involve similar alterations in structural and functional neurobiology and share pathophysiological mechanisms. The private doctor concluded that the Veteran suffers from both a chronic, service-connected bilateral foot condition and unspecified depressive disorder, and that the chronic pain associated with the service-connected bilateral foot condition is more likely than not a factor in his unspecified depressive disorder.

The Board finds the private opinion and rationale highly probative. In this regard, the private doctor reviewed the medical evidence and provided adequate supporting rationale for the conclusions reached when attributing the Veteran's symptoms and when rendering the opinion. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) ("[A] medical opinion must support its conclusion with an analysis that the Board can consider and weigh against contrary opinions").

In addition, the private doctor provided clear conclusions and supporting data, with citation to legitimate medical journals, as well as reasoned medical explanations that the pain associated with the Veteran's service-connected bilateral foot condition contributes to his unspecified depressive disorder. The private doctor noted a thorough review of the evidence, to include the Veteran's private and VA medical records, and subsequent treatment and follow-ups for his reported unspecified depressive disorder. Moreover, the private doctor noted that the Veteran's bilateral foot condition more likely than not aggravates his unspecified depressive disorder suggesting ongoing, continued chronicity.

The Board assigns great probative weight to the June 2021 private opinion. The examiners reviewed the Veteran's medical history and claims file, and offered a medical opinion supported by a clear and concise rationale that addressed the pertinent questions at issue. See Bloom v. West, 12 Vet. App. 185, 187 (1999) (the probative value of a physician's statement is dependent, in part, upon the extent to which it reflects "clinical data or other rationale to support his opinion"); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, supra; Stefl v. Nicholson, supra. As there is no adequate contrary opinion of record, all elements of service connection have been met.

In sum, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of an acquired psychiatric disorder. The only probative opinion of record is in support of the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection. Moreover, there is no sufficient basis for the Board to reject this supportive opinion and to further develop the claim. Cf. Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003) (holding that, because it is not permissible for VA to undertake additional development to obtain evidence against an appellant's case, VA must provide an adequate statement of reasons or bases for its decision to pursue such development where such development could be reasonably construed as obtaining additional evidence for that purpose).

Accordingly, service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, as secondary to service-connected bilateral hammertoes, bilateral plantar warts, and tinea pedis is warranted. In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt rule and finds it not applicable as the evidence is not in approximate balance. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) (2018); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
