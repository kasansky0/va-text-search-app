ORDER

Prior to November 14, 2023, entitlement to an initial rating of 50 percent, but no higher, for sleep apnea is granted. 

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to November 14, 2023, the Veteran required the use of a continuous airway pressure (CPAP) machine for his service-connected sleep apnea.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an initial disability rating in excess of 30 percent for sleep apnea have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.321, 4.3, 4.7, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6847.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2013 to July 2016.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO); therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the July 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. 

Following additional development, in the July 2024 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) increased the Veteran's disability rating for his service-connected sleep apnea from 30 percent to 50 percent effective November 14, 2023.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity as a result of a service-connected disability, and separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, consideration of the medical evidence since the effective date of the award of service connection is required. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 199, 125-26 (1999). Where entitlement to compensation already has been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).

VA has a duty to consider all regulations that are potentially applicable through the assertions and issues raised in the record.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  The Board will consider whether separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged ratings."  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

When adjudicating a claim for an increased initial evaluation, the relevant time period is from the date of the claim. Moore v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 211, 215 (2007), rev'd in irrelevant part, Moore v. Shinseki, 555 F.3d 1369 (2009). When adjudicating an increased rating claim, the relevant time period for consideration is the time period one year before the claim was filed. Hart, 21 Vet. App. at 509.

A veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes to him or her through the senses. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994). Lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology, where the determination is not medical in nature and is capable of lay observation. Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303 (2007).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with a claimant prevailing in either event. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an "approximate" (meaning nearly equal) balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any material determination. Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F.3d 1391 (2021); Ortiz v. Principi, 274 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001).

Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for sleep apnea prior to November 14, 2023, is granted.

By way of history, the Veteran filed a September 20, 2022, claim for service connection for sleep apnea. See September 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ. In a December 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for sleep apnea with an evaluation of 30 percent effective September 20, 2022, the date of claim. In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Request for Higher-Level Review (HLR) asserting entitlement to a higher disability rating. In November 2023, the AOJ issued a HLR rating decision in which it found a duty to assist error in the prior decision. Following additional development of the Veteran's claim, the AOJ issued a July 2024 rating decision in which it granted the Veteran an increased rating from 30 percent to 50 percent for service-connected sleep apnea with an effective date of November 14, 2023. 

The Veteran contends that the AOJ erred in assigning an initial disability rating of 30 percent and instead should have assigned a 50 percent rating effective September 20, 2022. As such, the question before the Board is whether the Veteran is entitled to an initial disability rating in excess of 30 percent for the period of September 20, 2022, to November 14, 2023.

The Veteran's sleep apnea disability is rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.97; Diagnostic Code 6847. Under Diagnostic Code 6847, a noncompensable rating is warranted sleep apnea that is asymptomatic but with documented sleep disorder breathing. A 30 percent rating is warranted for persistent daytime hypersomnolence. A 50 percent rating is warranted when use of breathing assistance device such as continuous airway pressure (CPAP) machine is required. A 100 percent rating is warranted for chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale; or requires tracheostomy.

Turning to the relevant evidence of record, in September 2022, the Veteran participated in a sleep study. The Veteran was diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnea and was recommended to complete a full night CPAP titration in order to determine an optimal CPAP pressure for his machine.

In October 2022, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination. The examiner noted a diagnosis for obstructive sleep apnea. The examiner reported that the Veteran did not require the use of a breathing assistance device. Further, the examiner noted that the Veteran experienced persistent daytime hypersomnolence.

In December 2022, the VA requested an addendum medical opinion to address the inconsistency between the Sleep study and the VA examination. More specifically, the clinician was asked to confirm if the Veteran requires the use of a CPAP machine as his sleep study says he does but the VA examiner reported that he did not.

In a December 2022 addendum VA medical opinion, the clinician opined that the Veteran's sleep apnea disability most definitely requires the use of a breathing CPAP device as noted in the Veteran's sleep study report. The clinician's opinion is probative, because it is based on an accurate medical history and provides an explanation that contains clear conclusions and supporting data. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).

After careful review of the foregoing evidence, the Board finds that an initial rating of 50 percent, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's sleep apnea from September 20, 2022, to November 14, 2023.

In making this finding, the Board has placed significant weight on the September 2022 sleep study which contain findings pertinent to the Veteran's claim. In this regard, the September 2022 sleep study provides the Veteran's sleep apnea diagnosis as well as noted the requirement of the use of a CPAP machine for breathing. 

The Board has considered whether an even higher, 100 percent rating is warranted at any time. As noted, a 100 percent rating requires chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale; or requires tracheostomy. However, as there is no medical evidence showing that the Veteran has chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale, or requires tracheostomy, the Board does not find that the criteria for a 100 percent rating have been met or more closely approximated. 

The Board has considered the evidence of record, including the Veteran's lay statements concerning his sleep apnea disability. The Board finds that the most probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran's sleep apnea disability was manifested by required use of breathing assistance device such as continuous airway pressure (CPAP) machine for initial period of the appeal to November 14, 2023. As such, the Board finds that an initial rating of 50 percent, but no higher, for the Veteran's sleep apnea is warranted. 

All other potentially applicable diagnostic codes have been considered. See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 593 (1991). However, the Board finds that no additional higher or separate ratings under a different diagnostic code can be applied. Neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with regard to the increased rating claims adjudicated herein. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017).
