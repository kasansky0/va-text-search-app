REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1992 to October 1996.

In October 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a September 2021 decision.  In November 2022, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior September 2021 decision.  

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to a TDIU is remanded. 

In May, July, and September 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability contending that he that he was unemployable due his anxiety, mental condition, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).   He reported last working in "policing" at the Sheriff's Office until June 2020, when he left due to his disability. He claimed that his mental condition, PTSD prevented him from securing or following any substantially gainful occupation.

A June 2021 VA 21-4192, Request for Employment Information in Connection with Claim for Disability Benefits from the Veteran's employer reported that the Veteran last worked as a Sheriff's Deputy on July 21, 2020.  

The issue of entitlement to a TDIU is remanded for compliance with VA's due process obligations because, at the time of the rating decision on appeal, the Veteran did not meet the criteria of 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).   

However, at the same time the TDIU claim was pending before the AOJ, the Veteran had claims pending before VA under the Legacy system for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD; irritable bowel syndrome; and residuals of head injury. See VA Form 9 (April 2020); BVA Decision (Remand December 2023). After remand development was completed, in a September 2024 rating decision, the AOJ awarded service connection for PTSD with persistent depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder, and unspecified anxiety disorder and assigned a 70 percent evaluation effective April 18, 2018.  The issues regarding service connection for irritable bowel syndrome and residuals of head injury still remain pending at the time of this decision.

In the October 2022 HLR, the Veteran's attorney requested to keep the Veteran's TDIU appeal alive as the Veteran's entitlement to TDIU was dependent on issues that were currently pending on appeal via the April 2020 VA Form 9.  

The practical effect of the AOJ's September 2024 rating decision was to now make the Veteran eligible for consideration of schedular TDIU under 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) and the service-connected psychiatric disability was relevant to the TDIU review period that must be considered in the first instance by the AOJ to ensure due process of law. The Veteran's service connected disability during the relevant TDIU review period now includes a rated disability, which had not been considered at the time of the AOJ's September 2021 rating decision on appeal. It is noted that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) recently held that the Board erred in finding that its grant of service connection was not evidence precluding consideration of that disability in addressing TDIU under the AMA. Green v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 127 (2024) (relied on prior decisions that addressed what is considered evidence in the AMA and, in particular, that evidence is defined as something "that tends to prove or disprove the existence of an alleged fact." Aviles-Rivera v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 268, 277 (2022) (internal quotation omitted), appeal docketed, No. 22-2084 (Fed. Cir. Aug. 1, 2022)).

Here, remand is required. In the AMA the Board has discretion to "remand for correction of any error by the [AOJ] in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim." 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). The award of service connection for PTSD with persistent depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder, and unspecified anxiety disorder coupled with the rating decision assigning a 70 percent rating effective from April 18, 2018, resulting in a combined 90 percent rating from April 2018, is new and relevant evidence that triggered the AOJ's obligation to readjudicated the TDIU claim in the first instance to ensure due process of law.

Thus, in light of the AOJ's implementation of the award of service connection and the assignment of a 70 percent rating from April 18, 2018, PTSD with persistent depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder, and unspecified anxiety disorder, and given that the AOJ had not had the opportunity to consider that disability at the time of the rating decision on appeal that denied the Veteran's TDIU claim, remand is necessary to ensure due process of law, to include fair process.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Adjudicate the claim of entitlement to TDIU with consideration of the Veteran's service connected PTSD with persistent depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder, and unspecified anxiety disorder.
