ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for stomach scar is granted.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for back scar is denied.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for right shoulder scar is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's midline abdominal scar resulted from surgery during active military service.

2. The Veteran's back scar measures 10 centimeters long and 1 centimeter wide, for a total area of 10 square centimeters, and is not painful or unstable.

3. The Veteran's right shoulder scar measures 5 centimeters long and 1 centimeter wide, for a total area of 5 square centimeters, and is not painful or unstable.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for stomach scar have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an initial compensable rating for back scar have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.

3. The criteria for entitlement to an initial compensable rating for right shoulder scar have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active military service from September 2017 to July 2023.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the respective AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Finally, the Board recognizes that the Veteran's June 2024 VA Form 10182 also included disagreement with the initial rating assigned by the January 2024 rating decision for his service-connected lumbar spine disability. However, the Veteran's disagreement with that decision is already on appeal by way of the May 2024 VA Form 10182, which is currently docketed under appeal number 240528-444336, and will be the subject of a separate Board decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection on a direct basis requires (1) competent and credible evidence confirming the Veteran has the claimed disability or at least has since filing the claim; (2) competent and credible evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a relevant disease or injury; and (3) competent and credible evidence of a nexus or link between the in-service injury or disease and the current disability.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1113(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).    

Entitlement to service connection for stomach scar.

The Veteran seeks service connection for an abdominal scar from an in-service spinal surgery consequent to an in-service injury. The Board finds that service connection is warranted.

In the January 2024 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for an abdominal scar on the basis that it preexisted service and was not aggravated by service. However, the Veteran's service entrance examination documents a single scar of the Veteran's right upper abdomen. See November 2016 Report of Medical Examination. To that end, the Veteran seeks service connection for an anterior post-surgical scar arising from in-service spinal surgery. See August 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ at 3. That surgical scar is a 14-centimeter midline abdominal scar and was noted to have resulted from surgery; the Veteran's medical records establish that the Veteran underwent two separate spinal surgeries only days apart: one with an anterior incision and the other with a posterior incision. See December 2023 VA examination; May 2023 medical records. 

The Board finds that the Veteran's 14-centimeter midline stomach scar was incurred in the April 2023 in-service surgery. As such, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for the Veteran's midline abdominal scar. The appeal is granted.

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321(a), 4.1.

Where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, consideration of the medical evidence since the effective date of the award of service connection and consideration of the appropriateness of a "staged" rating is required. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999). VA adjudicators must consider whether to assign different ratings at different times during the rating period to compensate the Veteran for times when the disability may have been more severe than at others. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has since extended this practice even to established ratings, not just initial ratings. See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for back scar.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for right shoulder scar.

The Veteran seeks compensable initial ratings for service-connected surgical scars of the back and of the right shoulder. In a January 2024 rating decision, service connection was granted for scars on the back and on the right shoulder, each effective July 23, 2023, and a noncompensable (0 percent) rating assigned for each under Diagnostic Code 7802. Under the current criteria, Diagnostic Code 7802 provides a 10 percent rating is warranted for scars not to the head, face, or neck that are superficial or that do not cause limited motion that cover an area of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.

At the December 2023 VA scars examination, surgical scars on the back and on the right shoulder were diagnosed.  The examiner noted that neither scar was painful nor had underlying tissue damage. The back scar measured 10 centimeters by 1 centimeter; the shoulder scar measured 5 centimeters by 1 centimeter. The examiner noted they did not review photographs.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's scars did not impact his ability to work. 

Based on a review of the record, the Board finds that entitlement to an initial compensable rating is not warranted for either the Veteran's back or right shoulder scars under Diagnostic Code 7802 because the record does not show that either of the Veteran's scars measured an area of 144 square inches (929 square cm) or greater. The Veteran's back scar and shoulder scar measured only an area of 10 and 5 square centimeters, respectively, at the December 2023 VA scar examination. As such, the criteria for compensable ratings for either scar under Diagnostic Code 7802 are not met.

The Board has considered whether separate or higher rating are warranted under alternate diagnostic codes. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 593 (1991). Diagnostic Code 7801 contemplates scars, other than of the head, face, or neck, that are deep or that cause limited motion. However, the December 2023 VA scar examination report does not reflect that either the shoulder or back scars are deep, and explicitly indicates that neither scar causes limited motion. 

Diagnostic Code 7804 contemplate scars that are unstable or painful. However, the December 2023 VA scar examination report explicitly indicates that both scars are not painful or unstable.

Diagnostic Code 7805 relates that any disabling effects not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-7804 should be evaluated under an appropriate Diagnostic Code. However, the December 2023 VA scar examination report explicitly noted no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs and/or symptoms associated with any scar.

In deciding the Veteran's claims for a compensable rating for the back and shoulder scars, the Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements that his service-connected disabilities are worse than currently evaluated. He is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge as it comes to him through his senses.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 471 (1994). He is not, however, competent to identify a specific level of disability of this disorder according to the appropriate Diagnostic Codes. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Such competent evidence concerning the nature and extent of the Veteran's disabilities has been provided by the medical personnel who have examined him during the current appeal and who have rendered pertinent opinions in conjunction with the evaluations. The medical findings (as provided in the examination report and the clinical records) directly address the criteria under which his disabilities are evaluated. As such, the Board finds these records to be more probative than the Veteran's subjective complaints of increased symptomatology. Accordingly, the claims for initial compensable ratings for back and right shoulder scars are denied.

The Board has considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt but has determined that it is inapplicable, because otherwise the evidence is persuasively against the assignment of higher ratings beyond those already assigned. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.
