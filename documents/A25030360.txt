DOCKET NO. 240807-461979
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On October 15, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205. In the present case, in October 2024, the Veteran stated that he wished to withdraw his "BVA claim, docket number 240807-461979." 

The Veteran has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
