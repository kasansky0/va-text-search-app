REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, including anxiety, depression, alcohol dependency and PTSD, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1961 to September 1964, April 1969 to April 1970, April 1970 to September 1973, and June 1979 to May 1995.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office.

Unfortunately, the Veteran passed away during the pendency of his appeal.  The Appellant, who is his surviving spouse, was granted substitution in April 2023.  

The Board is expanding the issue on appeal to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition to encompass the claimant's reported symptoms and other information of record.  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App.1 (2009).

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, she may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition is remanded.

The Appellant is of the position that the Veteran had an acquired psychiatric disability due to his active service.  A VA examination was not provided prior to the rating decision on appeal.

In order to establish service connection, a claimant must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement.  See 38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131;38?C.F.R. §?3.303; see also Shedden v. Principi,?381 F.3d 1163, 1167?(Fed. Cir. 2004). 

VA must provide a medical examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service, or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service, but (4) there is insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim. McClendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81?(2006).  

The benefit of the doubt rule provides that a veteran will prevail in a case where the positive evidence is in approximate balance with the negative evidence. 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); 38?C.F.R. §?3.102.  It is only when the weight of the evidence is persuasively against the claim that the claim must be denied.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

In March 2012, the Veteran was diagnosed with unspecified alcohol dependence.  In January 2015, his alcohol screening was positive.  He was noted as alcohol dependent in June 2016.  In October 2021, February 2022, April 2022, May 2022, and June 2022 private medical record, PTSD was listed as part of the Veteran's past medical history.  

In the April 2024 rating decision, the RO found that an active duty stressor could be conceded based on the Veteran's combat duty.  This is a favorable finding.  Favorable findings made by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) are binding on all AOJ adjudicators as well as on the Board.? 38 U. S. C. §5104A;?38 C.F.R. § 20.801.

Although the claims file includes a diagnosis as well as a favorable finding regarding an in-service event, a VA examination via records review has not taken place.  The Board finds that there is insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81?(2006).  The RO should have requested a medical opinion before denying the claim.  This is a predecisional duty to assist error, and a remand is necessary.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Provide the claims file to appropriate VA examiner in order to provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's psychiatric disability was related to service.  The entire claims file must be made available to the clinician to review. 

Although an independent review of the claims file is required, the Board calls the examiner's attention to the Veteran's January 2015, June 2016, August 2017 and December 2017 VA medical records and private medical records from October 2021, February 2022, April 2022, May 2022, and June 2022. 

The examiner is advised that VA has already conceded a stressor event because the Veteran had combat duty in Vietnam.  

The clinician is asked to determine whether the Veteran's psychiatric disorder was related to his period of active service, including combat duty in Vietnam. 

The clinician is advised that an opinion based solely on lack of documentation in service and following is not sufficient.

The clinician must provide a complete rationale for his or her opinion(s) in the examination report.  If any of the above-requested opinions cannot be made without resorting to speculation, the clinician must state this and provide a rationale for such a conclusion.
