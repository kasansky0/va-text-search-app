DOCKET NO. 210205-175904
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

As the claim of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical treatment provided on July 3, 2020 was granted in full, the appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved entitlement to payment of the cost of the July 3, 2020, non-VA medical treatment provided to the Veteran by Sentara Healthcare.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical treatment provided on July 3, 2020, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot. 38?U.S.C. §?7105; 38?C.F.R. §?20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The decision on appeal was issued in January 2021 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. 

On February 5, 2021, the Board received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal from the appellant, electing the Evidence Submission docket for the issue decided in the January 2021 decision.

Dismissal

The appellant provided non-VA medical services to the Veteran on July 3, 2020. See Medical Expense Reimbursement (1725/1725A/1728) - VHA (August 2021). A January 2021 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) decision denied payment for the services provided to the Veteran, determining that the appellant's claim was untimely. See Id. at 10. This appeal arises from the appellant's disagreement with that decision. See VA 10182 (February 2021). 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

The Board concludes that the issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical services provided on July 3, 2020, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801. 

In this case, following the appellant's submission of the VA Form 10182, the AOJ further researched the claim history. Upon additional research, it was concluded that the appellant met the criteria for reimbursement for the services provided to the Veteran on July 3, 2020. A July 2021 VHA decision shows that VA approved the claim for payment for the medical expenses billed by Sentara Healthcare. See Medical Expense Reimbursement (1725/1725A/1728) - VHA at 8 (August 2021). 

The administrative action approving entitlement to payment for the July 3, 2020, non-VA medical services constitutes a reversal of the denial and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal. As the appellant's claim has been approved, the appellant has no present case or controversy for the Board to adjudicate with regard to this or any other matter as contemplated by?38 U.S.C. §?7104. 

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. 38?U.S.C. §?7105(d).
