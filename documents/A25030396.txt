ORDER

The issue of entitlement to service connection for ulnar neuropathy and polyneuropathy, right upper extremity (claimed as right arm and shoulder secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI)) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 20, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) decision, the Veteran submitted a written statement indicating that he wished to withdraw from appellate consideration the issue of entitlement to service connection for ulnar neuropathy and polyneuropathy, right upper extremity (claimed as right arm and shoulder secondary to TBI).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for ulnar neuropathy and polyneuropathy, right upper extremity (claimed as right arm and shoulder secondary to TBI) are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205; Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1 (2020).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1971 to January 1973.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2021 rating decision that denied service connection for ulnar neuropathy and polyneuropathy, right upper extremity (claimed as right arm and shoulder secondary to TBI) as the evidence submitted was not new and relevant. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by a veteran or by his or her authorized representative.  Id. 

In the present case, in correspondence dated in March 2025, the Veteran stated that he wished to withdraw from appellate consideration all the issues listed on his June 2021 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, to include the issue of entitlement to service connection for ulnar neuropathy and polyneuropathy, right upper extremity (claimed as right arm and shoulder secondary to TBI), under the above docket number.

To validly withdraw an appeal via a written communication, 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 states that the communication must include the name of the appellant, the applicable VA claims file number, and an indication that the appeal is withdrawn.  Further, the communication must identify the specific issues to be withdrawn or specify that the appeal in its entirety is withdrawn.  Id.; see also Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 2 (2020).

Here, the Board finds that the March 2025 correspondence by the Veteran satisfies the requirements pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 for a valid withdrawal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for ulnar neuropathy and polyneuropathy, right upper extremity (claimed as right arm and shoulder secondary to TBI).  Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Veteran has withdrawn the issue currently on appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the issue on appeal and it is dismissed.  Id.
