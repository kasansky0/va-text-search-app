ORDER

The Appellant's character of discharge for the period of service from June 2013 to May 2016 is not a bar to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits and for that period of service, the appeal is GRANTED.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Appellant had active service in the Armed Forces from June 11, 2013 to June 8, 2019. 

2. A DD Form 214 of record expressly shows that the Appellant's first period of service prior to reenlistment, from June 11, 2013 to May 23, 2016, was honorable and not a bar to VA benefits.   

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Appellant's character of discharge for the period of service from June 2013 to May 2016 was honorable and is not a bar to VA benefits. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(2), 5303; 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(a).  

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

The Appellant served on active duty in the United States Army from June 2013 to June 2019. 

The case is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2023 VA Regional Office decision that determined that the character of discharge for the Appellant's entire active-duty service from June 2013 to June 2019 was a bar to VA benefits.  

In the January 2024 Notice of Disagreement (NOD or VA Form 10182), the Appellant elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, he may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this Decision. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR THE FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

Character of Discharge

Legal Criteria

To qualify for veterans benefits, a former service member must demonstrate that he or she is a "veteran" within the meaning of the veterans benefit statutes.  A "veteran" is defined by 38 U.S.C. § 101(2) as "a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service, and who was discharged or released therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable." 

Service department findings (i.e., the Army, Navy, and Air Force) are binding and conclusive upon VA for purposes of establishing an individual's character of service.  VA does not have authority to alter the findings of the service department.  38 C.F.R. § 3.203(a); Spencer v. West, 13. Vet. App. 376, 380 (2000); Venturella v. Gober, 11 Vet. App. 240, 241 (1997); Cahall v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 232, 237 (1994); Duro v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 530, 532 (1992); Soria v. Brown, 118 F.3d 747, 749 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Manlincon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 238 (1999).  VA has no authority to alter the claimant's discharge classification, and the claimant's only recourse is with the service department itself.  Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416.

There are two types of character of discharge bars that affect entitlement for VA benefits: statutory bars found at 38 U.S.C. § 5303(a) and restated in 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(c), and regulatory bars listed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(d).

As to the statutory bars, benefits are not payable where the former service member was discharged or released under one of the following conditions listed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(c): (1) as a conscientious objector who refused to perform military duty, wear the uniform, or comply with lawful order of competent military authorities; (2) by reason of the sentence of a general court martial; (3) resignation by an officer for the good of the service; (4) as a deserter; (5) as an alien during periods of hostilities, where it is affirmatively shown that the former service member requested his or her release; and (6) by reason of discharge other than honorable conditions (OTH) issued as a result of an AWOL for a continuous period of at least 180 days (the regulation provides certain exceptions to this condition).

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.12(d) state that a discharge or release because of one of the following offenses is considered to have been issued under dishonorable conditions: (1) acceptance of undesirable discharge in lieu of trial by general court-marital; (2) mutiny or spying; (3) offenses involving moral turpitude (this includes, generally, conviction of a felony); (4) willful and persistent misconduct; and (5) homosexual acts involving aggravated circumstances and other facts affecting the performance of duty.

A discharge or release, under OTH, because of willful and persistent misconduct is considered to have been issued under dishonorable conditions for VA compensation purposes.  38 C.F.R. § 3.12(d)(4).  An act is considered willful misconduct when it involves deliberate or intentional wrongdoing with knowledge of, or wanton and reckless disregard for, its probable consequences. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(n).  A discharge because of a minor offense is not considered willful and persistent misconduct if service was otherwise honest, faithful, and meritorious.  However, offenses that would interfere with the appellant's military duties, and preclude their performance are simply not minor.  Stringham v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 445 (1995); Cropper v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 450 (1991).

A dishonorable discharge, a statutory bar, or a regulatory bar deprives the claimant of all gratuitous VA benefits.  Such a discharge, statutory bar, or regulatory bar is binding on VA as to the character of discharge unless an exception, such as insanity, applies.  38 C.F.R. § 3.12.

An insane person is one who, while not mentally defective or constitutionally psychopathic, except when a psychosis has been engrafted upon such basic condition, exhibits, due to disease, a more or less prolonged deviation from his normal method of behavior; or who interferes with the peace of society; or who has so departed (become antisocial) from the accepted standards of the community to which by birth and education he belongs as to lack the adaptability to make further adjustment to the social customs of the community in which he resides. 38 C.F.R. § 3.354(a).  

When a rating agency is concerned with determining whether a veteran was insane at the time that he committed an offense leading to his court-martial, discharge, or resignation, it will base its decision on all the evidence procurable relating to the period involved and apply the definition in 38 C.F.R. § 3.354(a). 38 C.F.R. § 3.354(b).

Analysis

The August 2023 administrative decision on appeal found that the Appellant was not entitled to VA benefits because he received an OTH discharge from service for his entire period of service from June 11, 2013 to June 8, 2019.  In the January 2024 NOD the Appellant contends that he had two periods of service and that his discharge from the first period was honorable.  

The only DD Form 214 of record is for a period of service from June 2013 to June 2019 and, at first blush, reflects a discharge under other than honorable conditions.  The same DD 214, in its remarks section, indicates that the Appellant completed his first period of service and immediately reenlisted for a second period on May 24, 2016.  The remarks section also clearly indicates that his first period of service from June 11, 2013 to May 23, 2016, was "honorable active service."  

Further review of the record shows that for this first period of service, the Appellant was recommended for, and awarded, the Army Achievement Medal on September 30, 2015, and the Good Conduct Medal on April 11, 2016.   

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Appellant's character of discharge for the period of service from June 11, 2013 to May 23, 2016 was honorable and does not constitute a bar to VA benefits. The appeal is granted.
