ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is at least evenly balanced as to whether the Veteran's current tinnitus is related to in-service acoustic trauma.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1981 to July 1983, and from July 1985 to August 1990.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 higher-level-review decision, following a March 2024 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes that the time to modify his NOD under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (c)(2) has not yet expired. Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305, 307 (2024) ("because [38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2)] gives a claimant the later of one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mails notice of the decision or 60 days from when the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to change the NOD and select a different lane, the Board ordinarily may not decide an appeal before this time period is up").  However, as the Board is granting the benefits sought in full, there is no prejudice to the Veteran in issuing the decision now.

Tinnitus

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in the active military, naval, air, or space service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) current disability; (2) in-service disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Consistent with this framework, service connection is including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

In the July 2024 rating decision, the RO found that the Veteran had a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during the Veteran's service. Specifically, the RO found the Veteran's personnel records military occupational specialty as a data systems technician indicates excessive noise exposure on active duty.  The RO also found the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability. Specifically, a February 2024 VA examination report shows a diagnosis of tinnitus. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 U.S.C. § 5104A. Therefore, the Board will address whether the Veteran's current tinnitus disability is related to the conceded noise exposure in service.

In the January 2024 claim for compensation (VA 21-526EZ), the Veteran reported the onset of tinnitus was after serving on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in service. 

The Veteran underwent a VA audiological examination February 2024. The examiner opined that it is less likely than not that tinnitus was caused by or a result of military noise exposure. The examiner's rationale was service treatment records indicate no significant permanent shift in hearing thresholds greater than normal measurement variability from entrance to separation, and evidence of no permanent auditory damage on active duty. The examiner noted no complaint of tinnitus in service treatment records or at separation. The examiner further noted that although excessive noise exposure on active duty is conceded and tinnitus is reported today, there is no nexus of auditory damage on active duty to relate current report of tinnitus to military noise.

In this case, although a VA examiner rendered the opinion that the Veteran's current tinnitus disability was not related to in-service noise exposure, such an opinion is of no probative value, as it was based on the absence of in-service evidence of tinnitus. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Tinnitus is the type of disorder associated with symptoms capable of lay observation. See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370, 374 (2002) ("ringing in the ears is capable of lay observation"). The Veteran is competent to report that he has tinnitus and has indicated that he first noticed tinnitus during service and that it has continued since that time. The Board finds his statements regarding the onset of tinnitus and continuity of symptoms are credible. Thus, accepting his lay statements, and resolving reasonable doubt in his favor, the Board finds that service connection is warranted for tinnitus. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
