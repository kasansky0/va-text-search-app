ORDER

Prior to May 1, 2024, entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral plantar fasciitis is denied.

The reduction from 20 percent to 10 percent for the Veteran's service-connected right lower extremity radiculopathy, effective September 1, 2023, was not proper; the 20 percent evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected right lower extremity radiculopathy is restored effective September 1, 2023.

3. The evidence relied upon to reduce the rating for the Veteran's service-connected left lower extremity radiculopathy from 20 percent to 10 percent did not show improvement in his ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.

4. The Veteran's service-connected left lower extremity radiculopathy was manifested by moderate, incomplete paralysis.

5. The Veteran's service-connected right lower extremity radiculopathy was manifested by moderate, incomplete paralysis.

6. The Veteran's service-connected trigeminal neuralgia is manifested by moderate, incomplete paralysis of the cranial nerve.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. For the period prior to May 1, 2024, the criteria for entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral plantar fasciitis have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, Diagnostic Code 5269.

2. The reduction in rating of the service-connected right lower extremity radiculopathy from 20 percent to 10 percent disabling, effective September 1, 2023, was not proper. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105 (e); 3.344(c); 4.1, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 8520.

3. The reduction in rating of the service-connected left lower extremity radiculopathy from 20 percent to 10 percent disabling, effective September 1, 2023, was not proper. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105 (e); 3.344(c); 4.1, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 8520.

4. The criteria for entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's service-connected right lower extremity radiculopathy have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, Diagnostic Code 8520.

5. The criteria for entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's service-connected left lower extremity radiculopathy have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, Diagnostic Code 8520.

6. The criteria for entitlement to a 10 percent rating, but no higher, for the Veteran's service-connected trigeminal neuralgia have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, Diagnostic Code 8405.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1996 to August 1999, March 2003 to April 2004, and June 2004 to September 2004 with additional service in the Army National Guard.  

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from April 2023, May 2023, June 2023, and August 2023 rating decisions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In a September 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the respective agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

With regard to the claims denied herein, if the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for GERD and entitlement to increased ratings for the neck and left knee, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Finally, the Board notes that, on the VA Form 10182, the Veteran disagreed with the rating reduction for the plantar fasciitis proposed in the May 2023 and August 2023 rating decisions. However, at the time of the September 2023 VA Form 10182, the RO had not implemented the proposed reduction. A March 2024 rating decision reduced the rating to 10 percent effective May 1, 2024. As the proposed rating is not an appealable action by the RO, and the actual reduction occurred after the VA Form 10182 that initiated the appeal, the rating reduction is not before the Board for adjudication at this time and will be adjudicated in a separate decision pursuant to the April 2024 VA Form 10182 which appealed the March 2024 rating decision and other rating decisions.  In addition, the Board also notes that the Veteran filed a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, in July 2024 and included a claim for an increased rating for the Veteran's bilateral plantar fasciitis.  That claim is currently being developed by the RO.  Accordingly, the Board has only considered the period prior to May 1, 2024, in this decision.  

INCREASED RATINGS

Disability ratings are determined by the application of the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities, which are based, as far as practically can be determined, on average impairment in earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. When rating a service-connected disability, the entire history must be borne in mind. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). The Board will also consider entitlement to staged ratings to compensate for times since filing the claim when the disability may have been more severe than at other times during the course of the claim on appeal. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is generally to be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. The critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the disabilities is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other disability. See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis. See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint." The spine has no opposite joint.

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

1. Prior to May 1, 2024, entitlement to a rating in excess of 50 percent for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral plantar fasciitis.

The Veteran contends that his bilateral plantar fasciitis is more severe than currently rated. 

From, February 13, 2019, the Veteran was rated at the maximum 50 percent disabling pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5299-5276 for his service-connected bilateral plantar fasciitis. The Veteran filed a claim for increased on November 4, 2022.

The Board has considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to the foot. In Scott v. Wilkie, the Federal Circuit expressly adopted the Court's holding that disabilities specifically listed in the rating schedule may only be rated under Diagnostic Codes which specifically pertain to them. Scott v. Wilkie, 920 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (citing Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 336 (2015)). The Board notes that rating criteria for evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a were amended effective February 7, 2021, including the creation of DC 5269 for plantar fasciitis. 85 Fed. Reg. 76453 (Nov. 30, 2020). As such, after the amendment, the proper Diagnostic Code for the Veteran's bilateral plantar fascitis would be 5269. However, a rating of 50 percent or higher is not available under Diagnostic Code 5269. As such, the Board finds that prior to May 1, 2024, the proper Diagnostic Code was 5276. As 50 percent is the maximum rating under Diagnostic Code 5276, a higher schedular rating is not warranted. 

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-370 (2017) (confirming that Board not required to address issues unless specifically raised by claimant or reasonably raised by record evidence).

2. The reduction from 20 percent to 10 percent for the Veteran's service-connected right lower extremity radiculopathy, effective September 1, 2023, was not proper; the 20 percent evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected right lower extremity radiculopathy is restored effective September 1, 2023

3. The reduction from 20 percent to 10 percent for the Veteran's service-connected left lower extremity radiculopathy, effective September 1, 2023, was not proper; the 20 percent evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected left lower extremity radiculopathy is restored effective September 1, 2023

4. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's service-connected left lower extremity radiculopathy

5. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for the Veteran's service-connected right lower extremity radiculopathy

The Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating on November 4, 2022. An April 2023 rating decision proposed reducing a 20 percent rating assigned for the Veteran's service-connected right and left lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities. A June 2023 rating decision reduced the rating to 10 percent effective September 1, 2023.  The Veteran had a 20 percent rating assigned from September 19, 2018, to February 13, 2019, pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8521 and a 20 percent rating assigned from February 13, 2019, pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8520.  Accordingly, the Veteran had a 20 percent rating in place for his right and left lower extremity radiculopathy for at least 5 years before the reduction to 10 percent became effective on September 1, 2023.  

First, the Board will address the rating reductions for the Veteran's service connected right and left lower extremity radiculopathy.

Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), where a rating reduction is considered warranted and the lower rating would result in a reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments, a rating decision proposing the reduction or discontinuance will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons. The beneficiary will be notified at the latest address of record of the contemplated action, furnished detailed reasons therefore, and will be given 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that compensation payments should be continued at their present level. Final rating action will reduce or discontinue the compensation effective the last day of the month in which the 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final rating action expires. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e).

Here, the proposed reduction would have in a reduction of the Veteran's combined rating from 90 percent to 80 percent. The RO provided notice of the proposed reduction in an April 2023 rating decision and provided the Veteran 60 days opportunity to present evidence that the rating should continue at the present level and not be reduced.  After 60 days had passed, the RO issued a June 2023 rating decision informing the Veteran of the final rating action reducing his rating from 20 percent to 10 percent for his service-connected right and left lower extremity radiculopathy.  The final rating action took effect September 1, 2023, after 60 days had passed from the June 2023 rating decision informing the Veteran of the final rating action. As such, the Board finds that RO complied with the procedural requirements for rating reductions.  

Turning to whether a rating reduction was warranted based on the facts, the Board notes that to reduce a rating, the AOJ must find that: (1) based on a review of the entire record, the examination forming the basis for the reduction is full and complete, and at least as full and complete as the examination upon which the rating was originally based; (2) the record clearly reflects a finding of material improvement; and (3) it is reasonably certain that the material improvement found will be maintained under the ordinary conditions of life. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (a); Kitchens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 320 (1995). However, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (a) only apply where the rating to be reduced has continued for five years or more. Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413 (1993). Nevertheless, 38 C.F.R. § 4.10, which provides that "[t]he basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment," and 38 C.F.R. § 4.2, which provides that "[e]ach disability must be considered from the point of view of the veteran working or seeking work," apply generally to all rating reductions. Id. In any rating reduction case, the AOJ must not only determine that "an improvement in a disability has actually occurred but also that that improvement actually reflects an improvement in the veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work." Id. 

The Board notes that it has reviewed all the evidence in the record relevant to the period on review. Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no requirement that the Board discuss every piece of evidence in the record.  Hence, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence, as deemed appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claims.  See Gonzalez v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his service-connected/ bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy in March 2019 at which time the VA examiner noted that the Veteran had moderate, intermittent pain; moderate, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias; and mild numbness in his lower extremities bilaterally.  The VA examiner determined that overall, the Veteran's right and left lower extremity radiculopathy was manifested by moderate, incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve bilaterally.

The Veteran was afforded another VA examination in November 2022 for his bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  The Veteran reported current symptoms of daily painful and limited range of motion, stiffness, muscle spasms with intermittent sharp shooting pain down bilateral lower extremities, and numbness.  The VA examiner determined that the Veteran had mild, intermittent pain; mild paresthesias and/or dysesthesias; and mild numbness in his lower extremities bilaterally.  The VA examiner determined that over all the Veteran had moderate, incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve bilaterally.  The Veteran's service-connected bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy impacted his ability to work due to pain in both legs that caused difficulty with concentration at work.

On an August 2023 VA Form 9, the Veteran described major sciatic pain that traveled to both legs and was constant throughout the day with a severity of 8-9.  The Veteran described functional impairment explaining he could not stand, sit, or lay down for too long.  The Board notes that to the extent that the Veteran's August 2023 lay statement may be deemed an assertion that his bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy worsened, no remand is warranted since this evidence was submitted after the issuance of the April 2023 rating decision on appeal and, therefore, cannot be the basis for a predecisional duty to assist error nor the basis for a remand for another VA examination.

The Board finds that the March 2019 and November 2022 VA examiners' reports do not show an improvement in the Veteran's service-connected bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy nor an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work since the Veteran's symptoms and limitations remained relatively the same at the time of both examinations.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the rating reduction from 20 percent to 10 percent was improper.

Having determined that the rating reduction from 20 percent to 10 percent for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy was not proper, the Board will next consider the Veteran's request for an increased rating.  The Veteran's right and left lower extremity radiculopathy is rated pursuant to Diagnostic Code 8520.

Under Diagnostic Code 8520, complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve warrants an 80 percent rating. A 60 percent rating is warranted for severe incomplete paralysis with marked muscular muscle atrophy. A 40 percent rating is warranted for moderately severe incomplete paralysis. A 20 percent rating is warranted for moderate incomplete paralysis warrants. A 10 percent rating is warranted for mild incomplete paralysis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

Disability involving a neurological disorder is ordinarily rated in proportion to the impairment of motor, sensory, or mental function. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or, at most, the moderate degree. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.120, 4.124a.

The words "slight," "moderate" and "severe" as used in the various diagnostic codes are not defined in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities. The Board notes here that VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1) provides guidance in the assignment and definition of the terms of mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe peripheral nerve conditions. However, although the Board is not bound by the M21-1, it "is required to discuss any relevant provisions contained in the M21-1 as part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases." Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018). The Board further notes, although the "reasons-or-bases" requirement, of providing thorough explanations, to which the Board is held does not mandate it precisely define such undefined terms as in Diagnostic Code 8520, the requirement does dictate that the Board provide a statement of reasons or bases sufficiently detailed to enable the Veteran and the Board's reviewing court to understand how the Board applied these terms.

Section III.iv.4.N.4.c. provides a table that assists VBA adjudicators in determining the appropriate level of severity for incomplete paralysis, neuritis, and neuralgia. That table is as follows:

Degree of Incomplete Paralysis Description

Mild: As this is the lowest level of evaluation for each nerve this is the default assigned based on the symptoms, however slight, as long as they were sufficient to support a diagnosis of the peripheral nerve impairment for SC purposes. In general look for a disability limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a small area. A very minimal reflex or motor abnormality potentially could also be consistent with mild incomplete paralysis.

Moderate: Moderate is the maximum evaluation reserved for the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment (38 C.F.R. § 4.124a). Symptoms will likely be described by the claimants and medically graded as significantly disabling. In such cases a larger area in the nerve distribution may be affected by sensory symptoms. Other sign/symptom combinations that may fall into the moderate category include combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate. Moderate is also the maximum evaluation that can be assigned for neuritis not characterized by organic changes referred to in 38 C.F.R. § 4.123, or neuralgia characterized usually by a dull and intermittent pain in the distribution of a nerve (38 C.F.R. § 4.124).

Moderately Severe: The moderately severe evaluation level is only applicable for involvement of the sciatic nerve. This is the maximum rating for sciatic nerve neuritis not characterized by the organic changes specified in 38 C.F.R. § 4.123.

Motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability is expected. Atrophy may be present. However, for marked muscular atrophy see the criteria for a severe evaluation under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520.

Severe: In general, expect motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability. Trophic changes may be seen in severe longstanding neuropathy cases. For the sciatic nerve (38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520) marked muscular atrophy is expected.

Even though severe incomplete paralysis cases should show findings substantially less than representative findings for complete impairment of the nerve, the disability picture for severe incomplete paralysis may contain signs/symptoms resembling some of those expected in cases of complete paralysis of the nerve.

Neuritis characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain should be rated as high as severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve (38 C.F.R. § 4.123).

The opening paragraph to the table for diseases of the peripheral nerves states that the term "incomplete paralysis," with this and other peripheral nerve injuries, indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. The ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, combine with application of the bilateral factor.

Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence, to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6.

It should also be noted that use of terminology such as "severe" by VA examiners and others, although an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue. All evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

In order to warrant a higher, 40 percent rating, the Veteran's service-connected left and right lower extremity radiculopathy must be manifested by moderately severe incomplete paralysis.  

Here, the November 2022 VA examiner noted mild symptoms related to the Veteran's service-connected bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy and determined that overall, the Veteran's radiculopathy was manifested by moderate, incomplete paralysis bilaterally.  The lay and medical evidence does not indicate that the Veteran experienced weakness, diminished or hyperactive reflexes, nor muscle atrophy which are symptoms contemplated by a finding of moderately severe, incomplete paralysis.

To the extent that the Veteran perceives a greater level of disability than assigned, the Board places greater probative weight on the findings of the November 2022 VA examiner who has greater expertise and training than the Veteran in evaluating the nature and severity of his service-connected bilateral lower extremity radiculopathy.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

Lastly, the Board notes that the Veteran's 20 percent rating is effective from September 19, 2018.  The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's September 2023 VA Form 10182 requested consideration of an earlier effective date.  The Veteran has not provided any lay argument explaining his request for an earlier effective date.  Since the Veteran is now in receipt of a 20 percent rating for the entire period on appeal, including one year prior to the appellate period, the Board finds that no earlier effective date is possible for the Veteran's 20 percent rating.

For the reasons and bases stated above, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted for either the Veteran's right or left lower extremity radiculopathy. In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine; however, as the evidence is persuasively against the claim and the positive and negative evidence is not nearly in balance, that doctrine is not applicable.

6. Entitlement to a compensable rating for the Veteran's service-connected trigeminal neuralgia

The Veteran's service-connected trigeminal neuralgia is currently rated as non-compensable under Diagnostic Code 8405.

Regulations provide that the ratings for neurological disorders are ordinarily rated in proportion to the impairment of motor, sensory, or mental function. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120. For cranial neuritis and neuralgia, consideration is given for loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and pain. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

The regulations for evaluating neurological conditions state that disability is rated in proportion to the impairment of motor, sensory, or mental function. 38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Speech disturbances, impairment of vision, and visceral manifestations are also to be considered. 38 C.F.R. § 4.123 explains that neuritis and neuralgia, cranial or peripheral, characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbance, and constant pain, at times excruciating, is to be rated on the scale provided for the injury of the nerve involved, with a maximum equal to severe, incomplete, paralysis. The maximum rating that may be assigned for neuritis not characterized by organic changes will be that for moderate, or with sciatic nerve involvement, for moderately severe, incomplete paralysis. On the other hand, neuralgia, cranial or peripheral, characterized usually by a dull and intermittent pain, of typical distribution so as to identify the nerve, is to be rated on the same scale as neuritis, with a maximum equal to moderate incomplete paralysis for the nerve involved. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8405.

Neuritis of the fifth (trigeminal) cranial nerve is rated under Diagnostic Code 8305 and neuralgia of the fifth (trigeminal) cranial nerve is rated under Diagnostic Code 8405. Both are rated as for paralysis of that nerve under Diagnostic Code 8205. Evaluations under Diagnostic Code 8205 are dependent upon the relevant degree of sensory manifestation or motor loss. Under Diagnostic Code 8205, a 10 percent rating is warranted for moderate incomplete paralysis of the nerve; a 30 percent rating is warranted for severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve; and a 50 percent rating is warranted for complete paralysis of the nerve. The ratings are dependent on relative degree of sensory manifestation or motor loss. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8205.

38 C.F.R. § 4.124a defines the term "incomplete paralysis" as indicating a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type pictured for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. Id. Veterans suffering from tic douloureux or trifacial (trigeminal) neuralgia may be rated up to complete paralysis of the affected nerve. Id. 

The terms "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe" as used under Diagnostic Code 8502 are not defined in the Schedule. Rather than applying a mechanical formula to determine when symptomatology is "mild" or "moderate" etc., the Board must evaluate all of the evidence to ensure an "equitable and just" decision. 38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  However, mild is generally defined as "not severe." Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 787 (11th ed. 2003). Moderate is generally defined as "tending toward the mean or average amount." Id. at 798. Severe is generally defined as "of a great degree." Id. at 1140. The use of such terminology by VA examiners, although an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue. All evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision that is "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

Disability involving a neurological disorder is ordinarily rated in proportion to the impairment of motor, sensory, or mental function. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or, at most, the moderate degree. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.120, 4.124a.

It should also be noted that use of terminology such as "severe" by VA examiners and others, although an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue. All evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

According to the MERCK MANUAL, Part 1, Section IV, p. 1121, trigeminal neuralgia "is a syndrome marked by brief attacks of severe pain, the characteristic symptom is intense pain usually described as stabbing, lightening-like or shooting sensation of short duration in one of the divisions of the trigeminal nerve." Whereas the trigeminal nerve itself relates to "the chief facial sensory nerve and the motor nerve for the masticatory muscle." MERRIAM WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 1207 (11th ed. 2012).

The Board notes that it has reviewed all the evidence in the record relevant to the period on review. Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no requirement that the Board discuss every piece of evidence in the record.  Hence, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence, as deemed appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claims.  See Gonzalez v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

A November 2022 VA examiner noted a diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia.  The Veteran reported symptoms of facial pain on the right side, often triggered by chewing and speaking.  The VA examiner determined that the Veteran had mild, intermittent pain; mild, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias; and mild numbness at the right lower face and right side of his mouth and throat.  The VA examiner concluded that the Veteran had incomplete, moderate paralysis of the cranial nerve.  The VA examiner also determined that the Veteran's service-connected trigeminal neuralgia did not impact his ability to perform occupational functioning and ordinary activities.

In affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds at a 10 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's service-connected trigeminal neuralgia.  Here, the Board notes that the Veteran has been noted to have neuralgia, not neuritis, and that neuralgia is to be rated on the same scale as neuritis, with a maximum equal to moderate incomplete paralysis for the nerve involved. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8405.  In addition, the November 2022 VA examiner determined that the Veteran's service-connected trigeminal neuralgia was manifested by moderate, incomplete paralysis of the cranial nerve, which support assignment of a 10 percent rating. 

The Board acknowledges that on his March 2019 Fully Developed Claim, VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran alleged that removal of his wisdom teeth caused permanent nerve damage and that he suffered episodes of severe shooting and jabbing pain in his jaw when chewing and when shaving.  The Veteran alleged similar complaints in an August 2023 VA Form 9.  However, Diagnostic Code 8205 does not permit a rating in excess of 10 percent for neuralgia and, even if it did, the Board finds that the most probative evidence of record indicates that the Veteran's service-connected trigeminal neuralgia was manifested by moderate, not severe, incomplete paralysis of the cranial nerve.  

To the extent that the Veteran perceives a greater level of disability than granted by the Board herein, the Board places greater probative weight on the findings of the November 2022 VA examiner who has greater expertise and training than the Veteran in evaluating the nature and severity of his service-connected trigeminal neuralgia.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

Lastly, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran's September 2023 VA Form 10182 requested consideration of an earlier effective date.  The Veteran has not provided any lay argument explaining his request for an earlier effective date.  Since the Board has granted a 10 percent rating for the entire period on appeal, the Board finds that no earlier effective date is possible for the Veteran's 10 percent rating.

Accordingly, a rating of 10 percent, but no higher, is awarded for the Veteran's service-connected trigeminal neuralgia.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection, to include on a secondary basis, for GERD is remanded.

On his July 2024 VA Form 526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, the Veteran asserted that his GERD was secondary to his cervical strain, intervertebral disc disease, and spinal stenosis due to prescribed medications for these conditions causing the Veteran to experience acid reflux.

An opinion addressing secondary service connection for the Veteran's GERD was previously obtained in September 2017.  The VA examiner provided a negative secondary service connection opinion based on the Veteran not having objective or clinical evidence nor a diagnosis of GERD.  The September 2017 VA examiner explained, "If in the future, Veteran's medical records provide clinical/objective supporting evidence of a diagnosis of gastritis/acid reflux/GERD in this Veteran, I would suggest that Veteran may resubmit the claim so that based on the available supporting objective/clinical evidence appropriate medical opinion shall be decided."  

More recently, the Veteran was afforded another VA examination in March 2023 at which time a diagnosis of GERD was noted.  The March 2023 VA examiner provided a negative TERA opinion but did not address secondary service connection.

The Board finds that in light of the Veteran's current diagnosis of GERD, a new opinion addressing secondary service connection is necessary to adjudicate the Veteran's claim.  The failure to obtain a VA opinion addressing the theory of secondary service connection raised by the Veteran constitutes a predecisional duty to assist error.

Accordingly, remand is warranted to obtain a VA opinion addressing whether the Veteran's GERD is secondary to any of his service-connected disabilities, to include medication use to treat his service-connected disabilities.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's service-connected cervical spine disability is remanded.

3. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's service-connected left knee disability is remanded.

The Board notes that a review of the record reveals the Veteran takes medication for his service-connected cervical spine and left knee disabilities. See November 2022 VA examiner's reports.  Specifically, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran took Naproxen for his service-connected cervical spine disability and Motrin for his service-connected left knee disability.  As the applicable diagnostic codes and special musculoskeletal regulations do not reference medication, the Board must discount beneficial medication effects when assigning an evaluation. See Ingram v. Collins, __ Vet. App. __, No. 23-1798, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, *1 (Mar. 12, 2025).  Here, the medical evidence of record is inadequate to the extent it is unclear whether the ameliorative effects of such medication, if any, were discounted in determining the severity of the Veteran's service-connected cervical spine and left knee disabilities. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012). As such, a remand is necessary to correct the pre-decisional duty to assist error. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Request that a clinician with appropriate expertise review the claims folder and respond to the following with regard to the Veteran's GERD:

a). Is it approximately at least as likely as not that the Veteran's GERD is caused by or etiologically related to any of his service-connected disabilities, to include medication used to treat any of his service-connected disabilities?

b). Is it approximately at least as likely as not that the Veteran's GERD was aggravated by any of his service-connected disabilities, to include medication used to treat any of his service-connected disabilities?

All findings must be reported in detail and all opinions must be accompanied by a clear rationale. A negative nexus opinion may not rely solely on a lack of documentation of GERD in service treatment records. If the above issue cannot be resolved without resorting to speculation, then a detailed medical explanation as to why this is so must be provided.

An examination should only be scheduled if deemed necessary by the examiner.

2. Obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician to determine the severity of the Veteran's service-connected cervical spine disability.  An examination should only be scheduled if the clinician deems one is necessary to provide the requested opinions. 

a). The examiner should indicate whether any medications used by the Veteran are productive of ameliorative effects on the service-connected cervical spine disability. 

b). If so, the examiner must identify each medication and clearly explain what the Veteran's symptoms and ranges of motions would be without the medication in all relevant measurements, to include during flare-ups or with repeated use over time.

c). In so opining the examiner should consider the lay and medical evidence of record. 

A rationale for all opinions must be provided. If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, he or she must explain why an opinion cannot be provided (e.g., lack of sufficient information or evidence, the limits of medical knowledge, etc.).

3. Obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician to determine the severity of the Veteran's service-connected left knee disability.  An examination should only be scheduled if the clinician deems one is necessary to provide the requested opinions. 

a). The examiner should indicate whether any medications used by the Veteran are productive of ameliorative effects on the service-connected left knee disability. 

b). If so, the examiner must identify each medication and clearly explain what the Veteran's symptoms and ranges of motions would be without the medication in all relevant measurements, to include during flare-ups or with repeated use over time.

c). In so opining the examiner should consider the lay and medical evidence of record. 

A rationale for all opinions must be provided. If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, he or she must explain why an opinion cannot be provided (e.g., lack of sufficient information or evidence, the limits of medical knowledge, etc.).
