ORDER

The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board's) March 4, 2025 decision, which awarded an effective date of December 29, 2021, for the award of service connection for schizoaffective disorder with crack cocaine use disorder in long-term remission (acquired psychiatric disorder), is vacated.

An effective date of August 12, 2021, for the award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Board's March 4, 2025, decision that awarded an effective date of December 29, 2021, for the award of an acquired psychiatric disorder was erroneous.

2. The September 1992 rating decision that denied service connection for a nervous condition became final and VA received the Veteran's an intent to file on August 12, 2021, and a Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) to readjudicate a claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder on December 29, 2021. 

3. The Veteran continuously pursued the December 2021 claim. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Vacatur of the Board's March 5, 2025, decision for entitlement to an effective date of December 29, 2021, for the award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 7103(c), 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.904, 20.1000. 

2. The criteria for an effective date of August 12, 2021, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from July 1988 to November 1990. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a rating decision issued on May 15, 2023, by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, herein referred to as the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

In September 2023, the Veteran filed a timely Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) and requested a direct review of the evidence considered by the AOJ at the time of the issuance of the May 2023 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

In March 2025, the Board issued a rating decision which awarded an effective date of December 29, 2021, for the award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.

1. Motion to vacate the Board's March 5, 2025, decision for entitlement to an effective date of December 29, 2021, for the award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. 

The Board may vacate an appellate decision at any time upon request of the Veteran or his representative, or, as in this case, on its own motion, when a claimant has been denied due process of law or has been granted benefits based on false or fraudulent evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1000. For the reasons discussed below, the March 5, 2025, Board decision which awarded an effective date of December 29, 2021, for the award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is vacated.

As noted above, the Board awarded an effective date of December 29, 2021, for the award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder in the March 2025 decision. Such award was based on the date of receipt of the Veteran's Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) requesting readjudication of the previously denied claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder. However, the Board failed to award an earlier date based on the receipt of the Veteran's intent to file a claim. In this regard, although an intent to file a claim may preserve an effective date if a formal claim is received within one year of the intent to file a claim, this provision does not apply to supplemental claims. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii). However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) invalidated the part of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 that excluded supplemental claims from the intent-to-file framework; thus, if a supplemental claim is received within one year of an intent to file, the date the intent to file was received is the date of claim for effective date purposes. Military-Veterans Advocacy v. McDonough, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

Thus, as the Board failed to consider Federal Circuit's decision in its analysis, the March 2025 decision is erroneous and must be vacated.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to January 19, 2023, for the award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder.

The assignment of an effective date for an award is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on a claim for service connection or for an increase of compensation "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefore." 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date for an award of service connection is the day after separation from service or day entitlement arose, if a claim is received within one year of separation from service, otherwise the date of receipt of claim, or the day entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

A claim for VA benefits, whether formal or informal, must be in writing and must identify the benefit sought. 38 U.S.C. § 5101; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1 (p), 3.151, 3.155; Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 1999); Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377 (1999). Prior to March 24, 2015, any communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, was considered an informal claim. Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought. Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a).

As of March 24, 2015, VA no longer recognizes informal claims. In this regard, as of such date, a claimant, or certain other individuals as specified in section 3.155(b), may indicate a claimant's intent to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b). An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant. Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160 (a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b). 

Under the AMA, a determination on a claim by the AOJ becomes final unless the claimant continuously pursues the claim by filing a supplemental claim, a request for higher-level review, or an appeal to the Board within one year of the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.1103, 3.2500(c)(1). Before February 19, 2019, a Veteran could file a VA Form 21-526EZ to have a claim reopened. However, on February 19, 2019, the AMA went into effect and claimants could no longer file a VA Form 21-526EZ to reopen a claim; instead, a supplemental claim must be filed to readjudicate a previously disallowed benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160 (e). If a claimant continuously pursues an issue by filing one of the administrative review options within one year, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the initial claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h)(1). 

As noted above, the Federal Circuit invalidated the part of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 that excluded supplemental claims from the intent-to-file framework; thus, if a supplemental claim is received within one year of an intent to file, the date the intent to file was received is the date of claim for effective date purposes. Military-Veterans Advocacy v. McDonough, supra.

By way of background, VA received the Veteran's original claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, originally claimed as nervous condition, in May 1992, and the claim was denied in a September 1992 rating decision. Later that month, she was advised of the decision and her appellate rights; however, she did not file a notice of disagreement with such decision and no new and relevant service department records have since been received. Therefore, such rating decision is final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.156, 20.203, 20.1103.

Thereafter, VA received the Veteran's intent to file on August 12, 2021, and instructed her to complete, sign, and return a formal claim within one year of that date. On December 29, 2021, VA received a VA Form 20-0995 requesting to readjudicate the claim of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder (claimed as adjustment disorder). A July 2022 rating decision confirmed and continued the previous denial of service connection for a personality disorder, to include a nervous condition. On January 19, 2023, VA received another VA Form 20-0995 requesting reconsideration of her claim. Thereafter, the May 2023 rating decision on appeal was issued, which awarded service connection for schizoaffective disorder with crack cocaine use disorder in long-term remission. 

Here, the Board finds that continuous pursuit applies in this case as the Veteran filed her January 2023 VA Form 20-0995 within one year of issuance of the July 2022 rating decision. Moreover, her VA Form 20-0995 was received within one year of the August 2021 intent to file. Therefore, an effective date of August 12, 2021, the date VA received the Veteran's intent to file, for the award of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, is proper.
