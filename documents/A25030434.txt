DOCKET NO. 240623-451603
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In October 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received explicit and unambiguous notification from the Veteran, requesting a withdrawal of her claim appealed in the June 23, 2024, VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the claim of entitlement to an initial rating greater than 70 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with major depressive disorder have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 2017 to October 2018.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in December 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In her timely filed June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review option. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

1. Entitlement to an initial rating greater than 70 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with major depressive disorder is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal, which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by their authorized representative. Id. Unless an appeal is withdrawn on the record at a hearing, appeal withdrawals must be in writing and must include the name of the veteran, the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran, the applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 (b)(1).

In correspondence received October 25, 2024, the Veteran notified the Board that she wished to cancel her appeal by withdrawing her only pending claim before the Board emanating from the June 2024 VA Form 10182 NOD to specifically include entitlement to an initial rating greater than 70 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with major depressive disorder. The withdrawal is in writing and contains the Veteran's name, VA claims file number, and a statement indicating that the Veteran wished to withdraw her appeal in its entirety. The Veteran's withdrawal complies with 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 (b)(1).

When pending appeals are withdrawn, there is no longer an allegation of error of fact or law for appellate consideration. In such circumstances, dismissal of the appeal is appropriate. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (d)(5).
