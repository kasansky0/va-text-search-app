REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the Army National Guard and had a period of active duty for training from January 2001 to June 2001, and periods of active duty from March 2003 to July 2003, and October 2004 to January 2006.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) rating decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), that denied the Veteran's claim for entitlement to a TDIU, finding that the Veteran was not unable to secure or follow substantially gainful employment as a result of her service-connected disabilities.  The July 2024 rating decision noted the favorable finding that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities meet the schedular criteria for entitlement to a TDIU.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding as it is not rebutted by clear and unmistakable error.  38 U.S.C. § 5104A.

The Board notes that a February 2024 rating decision discontinued the Veteran's entitlement to a TDIU on the basis that the evidence showed that the Veteran was employed full time since October 2022.  Thereafter, the Veteran requested higher level review and in a June 2024 rating decision, the AOJ concluded that the Veteran was not unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, noting that the Veteran was considered gainfully employed.  In July 2024, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim seeking entitlement to a TDIU, and the AOJ denied the claim in the July 2024 rating decision.  Because the AOJ adjudicated the issue of entitlement to a TDIU on the merits, the Board concludes that there was an implicit finding of new and relevant evidence for this claim.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding, as no clear and unmistakable evidence is shown to the contrary.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5104A.

In July 2024, the Veteran initiated this appeal to the Board with the filing of a Decision Review Request (VA Form 10182), requesting direct review by a Veterans Law Judge on the evidence of record at the time of the rating decision.  In August 2024 correspondence, the Board acknowledged the appeal and informed the Veteran and his representative that the appeal had been placed on the Board's direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's rating decision on appeal, here as of July 19, 2024.  38 U.S.C. § 7113(a).  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

TDIU

The Veteran seeks entitlement to a TDIU on the basis of being afforded a protected work environment.  See, e.g., July 2024 VA Form 10182; 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  However, the claim is not ready for adjudication.

The July 2024 rating decision on appeal references but does not consider evidence indicating the Veteran's employment in a protected environment, specifically, the July 2024 statements of the Veteran and her employer.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 123 (2024) (Court defined a "a lower-income position that, due to the veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market").  Failure to consider this evidence in the adjudication of this claim is a duty to assist error, which must be remedied on remand.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

Although the July 2024 statement from the Veteran's employer describes employment since May 2021 with workplace accommodations for the Veteran's service-connected disabilities, the employment date is inconsistent with that provided by the Veteran in the October 2023 VA Form 21-4140, which indicates employment from October 2022.  Therefore, clarification as to the Veteran's employment history was needed prior to the rating decision on appeal.  The AOJ's failure to provide the Veteran with a TDIU application form to properly develop the record in this regard is a pre-decisional duty to assist error, which must be remedied on remand.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

Lastly, Social Security Administration information regarding the Veteran's earned wages above the poverty threshold referenced in September 2023 VA Individual Unemployment Annual Eligibility Letter is not of record.  Failure to ensure that this evidence is of record constitutes a duty to assist error, which must be remedied on remand.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Provide the Veteran with a Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability (VA Form 21-8940) and Request for Employment Information in Connection with Claim for Disability (VA Form 21-4192).  

"	Request that the Veteran fully complete and return both forms to help ensure that VA has all pertinent information regarding her employment, training, and educational background.  Allow a reasonable time for reply.

2. Associate with the Veteran's electronic claims file the "information from the Social Security Administration (SSA)" which indicates that the Veteran earned wages above the poverty threshold for calendar year 2022 that is referenced in the September 29, 2023 VA Individual Unemployment Annual Eligibility Letter.
