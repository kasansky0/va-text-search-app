REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (previously rated as sleep disturbance) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the United States Army from September 1973 to July 1999. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which denied service connection for obstructive sleep apnea. See March 2024 rating decision.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

The Veteran has submitted two other VA Form 10182 NODs. First the Veteran submitted an NOD on March 21, 2022. See March 21, 2022, Notice of Disagreement. Then the Veteran withdrew his first NOD and submitted a second NOD on March 23, 2022. See March 23, 2022, Notice of Disagreement. The March 23, 2022, NOD has been docketed and is pending adjudication. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea

The Veteran was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea in a March 2024 VA examination. See March 2024 VA Examination.  

The March 2024 examiner opined that the Veteran's condition was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) incurred in or caused by an in-service injury, event, or illness. See March 2024 medical opinion. The examiner provided the following rationale: 

Veteran's active service: 1973-09-05-04:00 to 1999-07-31-04:00. A thorough review of medical records was conducted. There is not enough evidence in medical records to support a direct service connection for sleep apnea (also claimed as sleep disturbance). Therefore, the Veteran's diagnosed sleep apnea (sleep disturbance), is less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) incurred in or caused by the complaints of fatigue during service. 

The provided opinion is inadequate as it is not supported by a well-reasoned analysis and does not provide the certainty needed for medical nexus evidence. The examiner does not provide a fully articulable opinion supported by facts and medical history of the case. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (holding that most of the probative value of an opinion comes from its rationale or underlying reasoning).

The opinion also does not consider all relevant evidence of record, including the Veteran's lay statements. See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 39 (2007) (finding that an examiner impermissibly ignored the appellant's lay assertions that he had sustained an injury in service); see also Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (stating that "The Board must be able to conclude that a medical expert has applied valid medical analysis to the significant facts of the particular case in order to reach the conclusion submitted in the medical opinion."). 

The RO failed to obtain an adequate opinion regarding the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea. This is a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

Accordingly, this matter is REMANDED for the following actions:  

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination for his obstructive sleep apnea. The examiner must review the claims file.

The examiner is asked to provide a response to the following:

Is the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea at least as likely as not related to an in-service event, injury, or illness? 

In providing the requested opinion, consider the Veteran's description of the in-service injury and symptoms as well as post-service symptoms. If there is any medical reason to accept or reject the proposition that the Veteran's reported injury and symptoms in service and thereafter represented the onset of the current disability, this should be noted. Stated another way, do the Veteran's reports about the symptoms align with how the currently diagnosed disability is known to develop or are the Veteran's reports generally inconsistent with medical knowledge or implausible?

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for his or her opinion(s) in the examination report.  If any of the above requested opinions cannot be made without resort to speculation, the examiner must state this and provide a rationale for such conclusion. In so doing, the reviewing clinician must explain whether the inability to provide a more definitive opinion is the result of a need for additional information, or that he or she has exhausted the limits of current medical knowledge in providing an answer to that question.
