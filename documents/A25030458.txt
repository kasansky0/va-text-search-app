REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1973 to September 1993.  He died in February 2024; his brother has been substituted as the appellant to process the claim to completion.  See 38 U.S.C.ยง 5121.

In a December 2019 rating decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) denied service connection for sleep apnea.  In February 2020 the Veteran timely appealed this decision directly to the Board and requested "Evidence Submission" review.  See VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD).  Under this option, the Board is limited to review of the evidence in the record at the time of the rating on appeal in addition to evidence submitted up to 90 days after the VA Form 10182.  38C.F.R. ยง 20.303.

In December 2023 the Board denied service connection for sleep apnea which the appellant appealed to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  In September 2024, a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR) vacated and remanded the Board's decision for compliance with the directives contained therein.

In the JMR the appellant and the VA Secretary (the parties) agreed that remand was warranted because the Board did not ensure the duty to obtain records had been satisfied.  Specifically, they determined that the Board failed to obtain an April 2016 sleep study that was discussed but not included in the claims file.  

Based on the foregoing, and consistent with the Court's September 2024 Order, the failure to obtain the sleep study constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error and the matter should be remanded to obtain the actual report. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain the actual report of the April 2016 sleep study provided by E. Valley Ctr., referenced in the VA Sleep Medicine Consult dated July 28, 2017.
