ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for chronic sinusitis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of chronic sinusitis and service on active duty in Kuwait from September 2006 to September 2007, April 4, 2007, to April 24, 2007, and May 2007 to June 2007.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for chronic sinusitis have been met.  38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1116; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309; Honoring our PACT Act of 2022, Pub. L. 117-168, 136 Stat. 1759 (2022).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from November 1990 to April 1997, May 2004 to September 2004, and September 2004 to November 2017.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office (RO).  The Veteran timely appealed the rating decision by submitting a VA Form 10182 and requested direct review of the evidence considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) under the Veterans Appeals Improvement Modernization Act of 2017 (AMA).  Under direct review, the Board cannot hold a hearing or accept additional evidence into the record.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301 (2019).  Therefore, the Board will consider the evidence of record as of March 8, 2024, the date of the notification letter for the rating decision on appeal.  Id.

Entitlement to service connection for chronic sinusitis is granted.

The Veteran seeks service connection for chronic sinusitis due to toxic exposure risk activity during his service in Kuwait.  

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service.? 38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131;?38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  Holton v. Shinseki,?557 F.3d 1362, 1366?(Fed. Cir. 2009);?38?C.F.R. §?3.303(a).  Service connection may also be granted for a disease first diagnosed after discharge when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.?38?C.F.R. §?3.303(d). 

The Veteran is presumed exposed to burn pits and other toxins (BPOT), and there is evidence of a current disability presumed due to such exposure under the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act).

BPOT exposure is presumed for veterans who served in specific locations on or after specific dates.  38 U.S.C. § 1119.  Here, the Veteran served in Kuwait from September 2006 to September 2007, April 4, 2007, to April 24, 2007, and May 2007 to June 2007.  See March 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative.  Accordingly, the Veteran is presumed exposed to BPOT under 38 U.S.C. § 1119. 

As for a current disability, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in December 2023.  The VA examiner noted that the Veteran experienced sinus pressure, constant headaches, and crusted nasal passages with postnasal drip.  The December 2023 VA examiner noted the Veteran had a diagnosis of chronic sinusitis and allergic rhinitis.  

A medical opinion was obtained in February 2024 from a different VA physician from a review of the records.  The February 2024 VA physician found that there was no evidence to support a diagnosis of chronic sinusitis because chronicity was defined by recurrent episodes of symptoms of sinusitis over several years in a row.  

The Board finds the December 2023 VA examiner's conclusion of a diagnosis of chronic sinusitis more probative than the February 2024 VA physician.  The December 2023 VA examiner actually examined the Veteran, and the February 2024 VA physician failed to consider the Veteran's reports of sinusitis symptoms in the December 2023 VA examination.  As the evidence is in at least approximate equipoise regarding a current condition, the Board will afford the Veteran the benefit of the doubt and find that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of chronic sinus.  

Certain enumerated diseases will be presumed related to service for veterans with in-service toxic exposure, to include BPOT.  38 U.S.C. § 1120.  Chronic sinusitis is one of those enumerated diseases, and the December 2023 VA examination shows that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of such.   

Accordingly, service connection is warranted for chronic sinusitis on a presumptive basis given the Veteran's presumed BPOT exposure.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1119, 1120.  This issue is granted pursuant to the PACT Act.  See 38?C.F.R. §§?3.307, 3.309. 

Finally, the Board notes that the effective date for an award of service connection for chronic sinusitis under the PACT Act is August 10, 2022, and other theories of entitlement in certain cases may afford Veterans an earlier effective date.  However, because the Veteran filed his VA Form 21-526EZ in October 2023, remand of the claim pursuant to other basis other than the PACT Act is not necessary because the Veteran cannot receive an effective date prior to the date of his claim.
