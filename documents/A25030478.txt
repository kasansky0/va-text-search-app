ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 30, 2022, for the addition of L.P. to the Veteran's award of additional dependency compensation benefits as a dependent spouse, is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

1. In February 1973, the Veteran submitted a marriage certificate indicating his marriage to L.P, along with a birth certificate with L.P.'s social security number. 

2. September 2013 rating decision granted service connection for two disabilities; the Veteran's combined rating was 50 percent effective October 17, 2011.

3. A September 2013 VA letter notified the Veteran that he was being paid as a single Veteran with no dependents, that he may be eligible for additional benefits based on dependency, and that VA may be able to pay him retroactive benefits for dependents if he submitted a dependency claim within a year from the date of the letter-VA received no response from the Veteran within one year.

4. On September 30, 2022, the Veteran submitted VA Form 21-686c (Declaration of Status of Dependents) adding L.P. as a dependent spouse.

5. December 2022 rating decision granted service connection for two additional disabilities, with a combined evaluation of 30 percent, effective October 17, 2011, and 60 percent, effective November 17, 2022. 

6. December 2022 notification letter informed the Veteran that his claim for additional dependency benefits was granted, effective September 30, 2022. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date earlier than September 30, 2022, for the addition of L.P. to the Veteran's award of additional dependency compensation benefits as a dependent spouse, are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§1115, 5107;38 C.F.R. §§ 3.4, 3.102, 3.155, 3.204, 3.205, 3.206, 3,400, 3.401.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from September 1968 to September 1972. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2023 Higher-Level Review rating decision by a Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the April 2023 VA Form 10182, the Veteran selected the hearing lane. In December 2024, a Board hearing was held before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge. A transcript of the hearing is of record.

The evidentiary record in a Higher-Level Review is limited to the evidence considered in the prior agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision under review; the higher-level adjudicator may not consider additional evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601 (f). Thus, in reviewing a Higher-Level Review decision, the Board may consider the evidence of record at the time of the underlying rating decision for which the appellant requested higher-level review (as that is the evidence that the AOJ was permitted to consider in the Higher-Level Review decision on appeal), as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant/representative during an evidentiary window. In this case, as the January 2023 rating decision on appeal constitutes a Higher-Level Review rating decision, the Board's current review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's December 14, 2022, Notification Letter, and any evidence submitted at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302 (a). 

This matter has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.800 (c).

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 30, 2022, for the addition of L.P. to the Veteran's award of additional dependency compensation benefits as a dependent spouse, is denied. 

The Veteran generally contends he should be assigned an earlier effective date for the award of dependency benefits for his spouse. 

Any veteran who is entitled to compensation for service-connected disabilities is entitled to additional compensation for dependents, including a spouse and children, provided that the disability is rated not less than 30 percent disabling. 38 U.S.C. § 1115; 38 C.F.R. § 3.4 (b)(2).

An award of additional compensation for dependents based on the establishment of a rating in the percentage specified by law for that purpose shall be payable from the effective date of such rating, but only if proof of dependents is received within one year from the date of such rating. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (f).

Awards of additional compensation for dependents shall be the latest of the following dates: (1) date of claim; (2) date dependency arises; (3) effective date of the qualifying disability rating provided evidence of dependency is received within one year of notification of such rating; or (4) date of commencement of veteran's award. 38 C.F.R. § 3.401 (b).

The "date of claim" for additional compensation for a dependent spouse is the date of the veteran's marriage, if evidence of the event is received within a year of the event; otherwise, the date notice is received of the dependent's existence, if evidence is received within a year of a request from VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.401. Proof of marriage is established by types of evidence set forth in 38 C.F.R. §3.205.

To add a spouse as a dependent, the Veteran must provide copy of the public record of marriage containing "sufficient data to identify the parties, the dates, and the place of marriage, and the number of prior marriages if shown on the official record." 38 C.F.R. § 3.205 (a). In addition, a claimant must provide the Social Security number of any dependent on whose behalf he or she is seeking benefits. 38 C.F.R. § 3.216.

Regardless of the regulation governing effective dates of awards, payment of monetary benefits based on compensation begins the first day of the month following the effective date. 38 C.F.R. § 3.31.

Relevant History: 

In February 1973, the Veteran submitted a copy of a marriage license showing his marriage to L.P. in December 1969, and a birth certificate documenting the birth of his child which noted L.P.'s social security number. 

In January 1976, a notification letter informed the Veteran that his educational allowance includes additional allowance for his spouse and children.  

September 2013 Notification Letter, detailing compensation, informed the Veteran that he was being paid as single with no dependents, and that he may be eligible for additional benefits based on dependency if VA Form 21-686c, Declaration of Status of Dependents, is completed and submitted within a year from the date of the letter. 

In September 2022, the Veteran submitted VA Form 21-686c, Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents, which indicated L.P. as his spouse since December 1969, and included her social security number. 

In December 2022, service connection was granted for two additional disabilities, with a combined evaluation of 50 percent effective October 17, 2011, and 60 percent effective November 17, 2022. The accompanying notification letter informed the Veteran that his claim for additional dependency benefits was granted, effective September 30, 2022. 

Analysis 

Initially, the Board observes that the Veteran has been in receipt of at least a 30 percent combined rating for his service-connected disabilities since October 17, 2011. Accordingly, the Veteran has been rated appropriately to receive additional compensation for all time periods relevant to his current appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 1115.

The Veteran does not contest the fact that he had not submitted a VA Form 21-686c, Application Request to Add and/or Remove Dependents, until September 2022, but suggests that no VA correspondence requesting dependent information to award dependency benefits was received. 

A review of the record shows that the Veteran first notified the VA of his marital status in February 1973. A marital license and birth certificate were provided. The marital license indicated that the Veteran and L.P. were married in December of 1969. The birth certificate included the spouse's social security number. 

A September 2013 rating decision granted disability benefits for two disabilities. The Veteran was awarded a 50 percent combined evaluation, effective October 17, 2011. In the accompanying VA notification letter, the Veteran was informed that he was being paid as a single veteran with no dependents, and that he may be entitled to additional benefits based on dependence, if attached VA Form 21-686c, Declaration of Status of Dependents, was submitted. VA received no correspondence from the Veteran intervening the date of this notice letter and his September 2022 VA Form 21-686c, pertaining to continued marriage or to request additional compensation based on dependent spouse-although he continued to submit additional claims.

In November 2022, the Veteran submitted a claim for compensation for disabilities. Service connection was granted in December 2022. See Rating Decision. December 2022 Notification Letter informed the Veteran that his claim for additional dependency benefits was granted as he met the criteria for establishing a relationship and because he has at least a 30 percent disability rating for compensation purposes. It was noted, specifically, that VA had added L.P. as a dependent spouse, effective September 30, 2022. 

Having carefully reviewed the evidence of record, the Board finds that there is no basis upon which to assign an effective date prior to September 30, 2022. As previously detailed, the effective date of an award of additional compensation for dependents will be the latest of the following dates: (1) date of claim; (2) date dependency arises; (3) effective date of the qualifying disability rating provided evidence of dependency is received within one year of notification of such rating action; or (4) date of commencement of the Veteran's award. 38 C.F.R. § 3.401 (b).

The date of claim is defined as the date of the Veteran's marriage, if evidence of the marriage is received within one year of the event; otherwise, the date notice is received of the dependent's existence and marriage to the dependent, if evidence is received within one year of VA's request. 38 C.F.R. § 3.401 (b)(1). Here, the earliest relevant date is December 27, 1969, the date the Veteran married L.P. However, the date of a veteran's marriage can only be the effective date if evidence of the marriage is received by VA within one year of the event. In this case, VA did not receive evidence of the Veteran's marriage to L.P. within one year of the marriage, and as such, the date of marriage cannot be considered a "date of claim" pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.401 (b).

VA received evidence from the Veteran of his marriage to L.P., and her existence as a dependent, on February 7, 1973, when a copy of their marriage license and certificate was submitted. However, at this point, the Veteran did not qualify for additional compensation for a dependent spouse because he did not have a combined disability rating for compensation of 30 percent or more. Further, VA received this evidence of marriage to L.P. several years prior to any request VA made in and long before the Veteran became eligible for an additional dependent. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.401 (b)(1).

Moreover, there is no evidence of a dependency claim for L.P., prior to September 30, 2022, when the Veteran submitted VA Form 21-686c. Indeed, VA did not receive from the Veteran any request for additional dependency benefits prior to this date, or information regarding the existence of L.P., within one year of the September 24, 2013, notification letter. Nothing in any communication prior to September 30, 2022, identifies the benefit sought, an increase in compensation based upon a change in dependency. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

The Veteran's assertion that he did not receive any notification from VA requesting dependent information implicates the "presumption of regularity."

The law provides for a presumption of regularity with regard to processes and procedures throughout the VA administrative process. See generally Marsh v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 381, 386-87 (2005); Crain v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 182, 186 (2003); Redding v. West, 13 Vet. App. 512, 515 (2000). However, the presumption of regularity is not absolute and may be rebutted by the submission of "clear evidence to the contrary." Warfield v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 483, 486 (1997). In this regard, the question of whether clear evidence exists to rebut the presumption of regularity is a question of law. See Crain v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 182, 188 (2003). An "assertion of nonreceipt, standing alone, does not rebut the presumption of regularity in VA's mailing process." Jones v. West, 12 Vet. App. 98, 102 (1998).

In the instant case, clear evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption of regularity has not been found because the record clearly shows that with the qualifying disability award in September 2013, VA notified the Veteran of the award and that he was being paid as a single veteran with no dependents, and how to obtain additional dependency benefits. As such, the presumption of regularity has not been rebutted and, therefore, applies. Thus, the Board finds the Veteran's testimony that he did not receive notice of the need for dependent information to be incredible, and thus not probative. 

Additionally, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.401 (b)(3), the effective date of the qualifying disability is only appropriate if evidence of dependency is received within one year of notification of such rating action. Here, following the September 2013 award notification, VA did not receive evidence of dependency within one year of notification of the award/rating decision. 

Finally, as to the date of commencement of the Veteran's award, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.31, this date is September 30, 2022, the first day of the calendar month following the date that VA received the Veteran's application for additional compensation for the Veteran's dependent spouse. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.401 (b)(4).

The Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's contentions and acknowledges that he did, in fact, notify VA of L.D.'s existence as his dependent spouse in February 1973. However, as explained above, the applicable statutes and regulations make clear a veteran must submit proof of dependency within one year of being notified of a qualifying rating action. In this case, the VA did not have actual knowledge that L.D. remained a dependent spouse at the time the Veteran had at least a 30 percent disability compensation evaluation, whereas the Veteran had knowledge of this and could have informed VA. 

The Board has considered whether the filing period for additional dependency benefits may be equitably tolled. Precedent cases have held that a statutory filing period may be equitably tolled due to conduct of VA. See Bailey v. West, 160 F.3d 1360, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Equitable tolling, as an example, is available when the claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies but has filed a defective pleading during the statutory period, or where a claimant has been induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass. Jaquay v. Principi, 304 F.3d 1276, 1282-83 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit specifically held in Bailey that equitable tolling in the paternalistic Veterans' benefits context does not require misconduct such as trickery; however, Bailey does require the Appellant to have been "misled by the conduct of his adversary into allowing the filing deadline to pass." Bailey, 160 F.3d at 1365; see also (William) Smith v. West, 13 Vet. App. 525 (2000). Here, the Board finds no basis for the deadlines to be equitably tolled because there is no clear VA misconduct since it provided notice to the Veteran, at the time of the qualifying disability awards, and there is no evidence that the Veteran pursued additional dependency benefits until September 30, 2022, just prior to the December 2022 award of benefit.

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc); 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
