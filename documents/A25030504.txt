ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for left knee disability is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a September 2024 rating decision, the regional office (RO) found that the Veteran's left knee disability was directly related to service.

2. Due to the RO's favorable finding that the Veteran's left knee disability is directly related to service, the Board resolves the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran.

3. The evidence of record is in at least approximate balance that the Veteran's tinnitus is related to his active-duty service, and therefore, the Board resolves the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for left knee disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§?1101, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§?1101, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Navy on active duty from February 2000 to November 2008.

The issues come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from January 2024 and February 2024 rating decisions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of service connection for tinnitus and left knee disability most recently addressed in a December 2018 rating decision.  In January 2024 and February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decisions on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received, and denied the claims based on the evidence of record.

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 and February 2024 AOJ decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be warranted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

As a general matter, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Additionally, certain chronic diseases, including tinnitus, may be presumed to have been incurred during service if the disorder becomes manifest to a compensable degree within one year of separation from active duty.  38?U.S.C. §§?1101, 1112, 1113; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.307, 3.309(a).  Alternatively, for chronic diseases shown in service, the third element of service connection may be established through demonstrating chronicity or continuity of symptomatology in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b).  See Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

1. Entitlement to service connection for left knee disability

The Veteran contends that his left knee disability is related to his active-duty service.

As an initial matter, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a left knee disability.  Further, the Veteran reported that he injured his knee in service when he fell down a ladder during physical training and stepped in a hole.  Thus, the issue turns upon whether there is evidence of a nexus between the in-service injury and the present diagnosed disability.  See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  The Board finds there is.

In September 2024, the RO, also referred to as the agency of original jurisdiction, granted service connection for a left knee disability.  The RO specifically found that the condition was directly related to the Veteran's military service.  The Board notes that the Board is bound by any favorable findings made by the RO.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).

Therefore, due to the RO finding that the Veteran's left knee disability is directly related to his military service, and the Veteran has been diagnosed with a left knee disability during the pendency of the appeal, the Board finds that service connection for a left knee disability is warranted.

2. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus

The Veteran generally contends that he was exposed to harmful noise during his active service that resulted in bilateral tinnitus.

Tinnitus is by definition, "a noise in the ears, such as ringing, buzzing, roaring, or clicking.  It is usually subjective in type."  Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 1914 (30th ed. 2003).  As such, tinnitus is "subjective," as its existence is generally determined by whether or not the Veteran claims to experience it.  For VA purposes, tinnitus has been specifically found to be a disorder with symptoms that can be identified through lay observation alone.  See Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002).

The February 2024 rating decision included the favorable findings that the Veteran was diagnosed with tinnitus in his February 2024 VA examination.  Additionally, the RO found the evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during the Veteran's service, as the Veteran's military record shows service as a Machinist Mate, which has a high probability for hazardous noise exposure.

Thus, an award of service connection turns on whether there is evidence of a nexus between the established in-service noise exposure and the Veteran's present tinnitus.  See Shedden, 381 F.3d at 1167.  In the present case, the evidence of record supports such a finding.

During the Veteran's February 2024 VA tinnitus examination, the Veteran reported the date of onset of tinnitus occurred in 2004, when he was exposed to noise from the engine room in service.  The Veteran reported intermittent frequency in his ears occurring weekly and lasting a few minutes.  The Veteran reported his condition impacted his ability to sleep, noting that he needed fan noise to sleep.

The record contains the Veteran's November 2018 VA tinnitus examination, which notes the Veteran reported tinnitus occurring twice per month that caused occasional headaches.

The Board recognizes the Veteran's lay reports of recurrent tinnitus with an onset in 2004 offered in the February 2024 VA examination.  Further, the Board recognizes the Veteran's reports of symptoms on his November 2018 VA examination of persistent or recurring noises in his head or ears causing headaches.  The Board finds the Veteran competent to report continued ringing in his ears since service.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Moreover, the Board finds the Veteran's continued complaints of ringing and discomfort in his ears demonstrates continuity of symptomatology of tinnitus since its onset in service.  The Veteran's lay statements of recurrent tinnitus since 2004 are consistent with the Veteran's lay evidence and diagnosis later confirmed by the February 2024 clinical findings.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

The Board acknowledges the February 2024 VA examination addressing the Veteran's claimed tinnitus.  Here, the Board assigns little probative value to the February 2024 negative nexus medical opinion, as the VA examination determined the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus but also noted the condition is not consistent with induced tinnitus.  The February 2024 VA opinion is internally inconsistent and therefore provides little probative medical evidence.

Given the Veteran's credible lay statements and service treatment evidence, the evidence of record is at least in approximate balance on this matter.  The Board must consider all the evidence of record and make appropriate competence, credibility, and weight determinations.  See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 367-68 (2005).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, by law, the Board must resolve all reasonable doubt in favor of the veteran.  See 38?U.S.C. §§?1154(a); 5107; 38?C.F.R. §?3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  Thus, the benefit of the doubt must be resolved in favor of the Veteran, and entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.  38 C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.303; see Lynch, supra.
