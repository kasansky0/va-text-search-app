REMANDED

Eligibility for benefits under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) is remanded. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active military service from December 1988 to August 1992.

In the January 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the appellant elected the Direct Review Docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2020 and September 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38?C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to benefits under the PCAFC is remanded. 

The Veteran had a 90 percent total disability rating since February 21, 2020, and 100 percent disability rating from October 5, 2023, with individual unemployability from February 21, 2020, and special monthly compensation (SMC) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s) from September 1, 2021. He and the Caregiver-Applicant (non-family member) filed an application for PCAFC?benefits in July 2020. 

The claim was originally denied in August 2020 with the note that the Veteran was called to verify the "10-10 CG" form and contact was not made. See CAPRI Records. Subsequently, in August 2020, the Veteran was sent a no contact letter with a suspense date of August 17, 2020, for response. The Veteran did not respond and therefore, the PCAFC application was closed. In a September 2020 denial, the Veteran was noted to have served before 9/11; therefore, his application was denied as he did not meet the eligibility criteria.  

Initially, caregiver benefits were only available to Veterans who had a serious injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty on or after September 11, 2001. However, the VA MISSION Act?of 2018 expanded PCAFC?eligibility to include Veterans from all service eras, not just beginning on September 11, 2001. Effective October 1, 2020, the eligibility requirements hold a Veteran may be eligible for PCAFC?if they had a serious injury incurred in or aggravated in the line of duty of active service on or before May 7, 1975. Effective October 1, 2022, eligibility expanded to injury incurred or aggravated in active service during any period. In addition to the serious injury and service dates, the Veteran must also be in need of personal care services for a minimum of six continuous months with an inability to perform an activity of daily living (ADL) or have a need for supervision, protection, or instruction. 

In this case, the Veteran submitted the PCAFC application in July 2020. As discussed above, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim for PCAFC benefits in September 2020 noting that the Veteran did not have service within the eligible dates of service. In light of implementation of the MISSION Act, PCAFC?eligibility has been expanded, and the Veteran had active service which makes him eligible for consideration of PCAFC benefits. At the present time, all periods of service are eligible. Hence, the date the instant Veteran incurred the serious injury is no longer a threshold bar to basic eligibility. Because the serious injury was incurred during an eligible period of service, it now qualifies for this threshold eligibility criteria. Remand is needed to allow the AOJ to continue processing the claim and conduct necessary assessments including the Veteran Assessment, the Caregiver Assessment, and the Veteran Functional Assessment Instrument prior to issuing an eligibility determination. 38 U.S.C. § 1720G. This constitutes a pre-decisional error. 

Remand is also necessary because notification of the August 2020 and September 2020 decisions were legally inadequate. 

Under 38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a), the Board may remand for correction of any error by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim. 38?U.S.C. §?1720G(a)(12). PCAFC requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to notify individuals who submit an application for the program of decisions affecting the furnishing of assistance with notice as described within 38?U.S.C. §?5104. 

Generally, notice under 38?U.S.C. §?5104(b) must include the following: (1) identification of the issues adjudicated; (2) a summary of the evidence considered by VA; (3) a summary of the applicable laws and regulations; (4) identification of findings favorable to the claimant; (5) in the case of a denial, identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial; (6) an explanation of how to obtain or access evidence used in making the decision; and (7) if applicable, identification of the criteria that must be satisfied to grant service connection or the next higher level of compensation. 38?U.S.C. §?5104(b). Notice must also set forth the?right to a hearing, the right of?representation, and the?right, as well as the?necessary procedures and time limits to?initiate a higher-level review, supplemental claim, or appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. 38?C.F.R. §?3.102(b)(1).

Claimants and their representatives?are entitled to notice of?any decision made by VA affecting the?payment of?benefits or the granting of?relief. 38 C.F.R. §?3.103(b)(1). Notification will be in writing. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(f). 

In this case, based on the record before the Board, denial letters were not sent to the Veteran or his representative. As such, the notice was insufficient, in that they do not comply with 38?U.S.C. §?5104(b) and include elements such as a summary of the evidence considered by VA; a summary of the applicable laws and regulations; identification of findings favorable to the claimant; and in the case of a denial, identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial. For these reasons, notice is insufficient in this case. Remand is needed to cure this due process deficiency. 

Correction of these errors by the AOJ is necessary to satisfy a statutory duty under?38?U.S.C. §?5104 and a duty-to-assist?error that occurred prior to the decisions on appeal. See 38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a); see also 38?U.S.C. §?1720G(a)(12). 

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a current medical opinion from the CEAT as to whether:

(a.) The Veteran requires personal care services each time he completes one or more of the following: 	

i.	Dressing or undressing oneself; 

ii.	Bathing; 

iii.	Grooming oneself in order to keep oneself clean and presentable; 

iv.	Adjusting any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliance, that by reason of the particular disability, cannot be done without assistance?(this does not include the adjustment of appliances that nondisabled persons would be unable to adjust without aid, such as supports, belts, lacing at the back, etc.); 

v.	Toileting or attending to toileting; 

vi.	Feeding oneself due to loss of coordination of upper extremities, extreme weakness, inability to swallow, or the need for a non-oral means of nutrition; or  

vii.	Mobility (walking, going up stairs, transferring from bed to chair, etc.). 

(b.) Has a need for supervision or protection based on symptoms or residuals of neurological or other impairment or injury; or 

(Continued on the next page)

?

(c.) Has a need for regular or extensive instruction or supervision without which the ability of the Veteran to function in daily life would be seriously impaired. 

2. Issue a notice of the decision on the issue of entitlement to eligibility for PCAFC benefits as described in?38?U.S.C. §?5104. The notice shall include but is not limited to, a summary of the evidence; a summary of the applicable laws and regulations; identification of findings favorable to the claimant; and identification of the elements not satisfied but necessary for establishing eligibility for PCAFC benefits under 38?C.F.R. §?71.15-71.25. Notice must be provided to the Veteran, his representative (if applicable), and the Caregiver-Applicant.
