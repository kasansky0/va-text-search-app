DOCKET NO. 201215-126164
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 29, 2019, for service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record shows the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for PTSD, received by VA as the Veteran's intent to file on May 29, 2019, preceding within one year the May 29, 2020, date of claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an effective date of May 29, 2019, for the award of service connection for PTSD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.155, 3.159, 3.303, 3.304, 3.400, 4.3.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active duty service from July 2010 to December 2013.

In a June 2020 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for PTSD with an effective date of May 29, 2020.

In July 2020, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2020 decision denying an earlier effective date for PTSD.  In December 2020, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2020 decision.  

In the December 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on July 19, 2024. A transcript is of record.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2020 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of May 29, 2019, for service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

In a June 2020 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for PTSD with an effective date of May 29, 2020, the date that VA received the Veteran's claim. The Veteran asserts that he is entitled to an effective date of May 29, 2019, for service connection for PTSD, the date that VA received his intent to file. See July 2020 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review; see also July 2020 Board Hearing Transcript.

In general, the effective date for the grant of service connection based upon an original claim is either the day following separation from active service, or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, it will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400 (b)(2)(i), (ii). A claim is a formal or informal communication, in writing, requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). "Date of receipt" means the date on which a claim, information, or evidence was received by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. See Standard Claims and Appeals Forms, 79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014). These amendments implemented the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date for benefits must be received in one of three specified formats. VA may grant entitlement to benefits from an effective date prior to the date the claim was received as long as a complete claim is received within one year of receipt of the intent to file. When the complete claim is received within one year of the intent to file, the effective date rules may be applied based on the intent to file (ITF). 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

These general rules apply equally under the legacy and AMA systems of review. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1).

In implementing the AMA, the preamble to 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 specifically precluded application of the ITF provisions for supplemental claims. However, this preamble was invalidated in Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Accordingly, the Board finds the ITF rules apply here.

Turning to the record, the Veteran filed a VA 21-0966 ITF dated May 22, 2019. There are no prior claims for a mental health disability in the file. The Veteran's claims file indicates that the ITF was received by the VA Claims Intake Center and uploaded to the record on May 22, 2019. However, correspondence sent to the Veteran and his representative at the time from the Regional Office Director dated September 16, 2019, stated that the intent to file was received on May 29, 2019. The letter stated "[i]f your completed application is received within one year from the date that your intent to file was received and we decide that you are entitled to VA benefits, we may be able to compensate you from the date we received your intent to file." Thereafter, the Veteran filed a VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim for service connection for PTSD on May 29, 2020. 

Initially, the Board observes that the May 2019 intent to file gave rise to VA's duty to inform the Veteran of the formalities required to file a claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a), (b). VA responded as required under 3.155(a) by informing the Veteran of the information necessary to complete an application and providing him with any of the necessary forms to submit his claim. However, in this notification, VA indicated that the date of receipt was May 29, 2019, and that the Veteran had one year from the date of receipt to file his formal claim. See September 16, 2019, correspondence. Therefore, resolving reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the date of receipt of the intent to file is May 29, 2019. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r).

The Board notes that the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has noted that the Board is "obligated to ensure that it provides to appellants fair process in the adjudication of their claims" Smith v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 332, 337 (2020). The Court has held that, "even in situations where no particular procedural process is required by statute or regulation, the principle of fair process may nonetheless require additional process if it is implicitly required when 'viewed against [the] underlying concepts of procedural regularity and basic fair play' of the VA benefits adjudicatory system." Id. (quoting Thurber v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 119, 123 (1993)). 

Here, VA provided notice to the Veteran pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) indicating that they received his intent to file on May 29, 2019. The Veteran submitted a complete claim for service connection for PTSD within one year of that date, on May 29, 2020. This is the earliest date possible and discussion of the COVID 19 extension raised at the hearing is not necessary.

In light of the unique circumstances of this case and taking into account the principles of fair play as noted in Smith, 32 Vet. App. at 337 and Thurber, 5 Vet. App. at 123, the Board finds that the Veteran should not be deprived of a benefit available to him and finds entitlement to an effective date of May 29, 2019, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for PTSD is warranted.
