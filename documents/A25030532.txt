REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 2006 to February 2012.

The case is on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision.

In the April 2024 notice of disagreement (NOD) on appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).

I. Service Connection

1. Service connection for a right hip disorder.

2. Service connection for a left hip disorder.

3. Service connection for a right knee disorder.

4. Service connection for a left knee disorder.

Legal Criteria

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  A veteran seeking compensation under these provisions must establish three elements: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service."  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (quoting Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).  

Service connection may also be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, service-connected disease or injury.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.

Analysis

In the November 2023 claim on appeal, the Veteran claimed that he has bilateral hip and knee disorders due to running and training in heavy equipment for years during service.  He also claimed that his service-connected back disability results in issues with his hips and knees.  In a November 2023 statement, the Veteran claimed that a physician has treated him on several occasions for his hips and knees.  He stated that he experiences hip and knee symptoms when exercising.  He also stated that during cold weather he can barely walk and has difficulty entering or leaving a vehicle.

The Veteran's service personnel records (SPRs) show that he served as a member of the security forces domestically.  His service treatment records (STRs) do not include reports of or treatment for hip or knee symptoms.  During treatment for his back in May 2011, a treatment provider denied the presence of lower extremity sensory or motor deficit.  The provider reported that the Veteran's walking gait was normal.  The Veteran completed a medical assessment at separation from service in February 2012.  He reported experiencing back and hearing problems during service, but did not report anything in regard to his hips or knees.

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted post-service private treatment records.  These records do not include any reports of or treatment for hip or knee symptoms or disorders.  Private treatment providers reported in November 2021 and November 2022 that his walking gait is normal.

The Board finds that the Veteran's right and left hip and knee disorders did not have their onsets during service, are not causally or etiologically related to any disease, injury, or incident during service, and are not caused or aggravated by lumbosacral strain with DDD.  The Veteran's STRs do not include any reports of or treatment for hip or knee symptoms.  The Veteran also did not report experiencing hip or knee issues at separation from service in February 2012, despite reporting other medical conditions at that time.  Furthermore, the Veteran's post-service treatment records do not include findings from a treatment provider that indicate he has a hip or knee disorder related to service or secondary to a back disorder.  Although medical examinations have not been obtained to in regard to these claims, a mere conclusory claim that a current condition is related to service or secondary to another service-connected condition is insufficient to require the Secretary to provide an examination.  See Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (2010) (distinguishing cases where only a conclusory generalized statement is provided and rejecting the theory that medical examinations are to be routinely and virtually automatically provided to all veterans in disability cases involving nexus issues).  In this case, the only evidence indicating a nexus between the claimed disorders and service or the service-connected back disability is the Veteran's November 2023 claim and accompanying lay statement.

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against these claims.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for right and left hip and knee disorders is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

II. Increased Rating

5. An initial rating in excess of 10 for lumbosacral strain with DDD.

Legal Criteria

Ratings are based on a schedule of reductions in earning capacity from specific injuries or combination of injuries.  The ratings shall be based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairments of earning capacity resulting from such injuries in civil occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  Generally, the degrees of disability specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbations or illnesses proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

Disabilities of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or inflammation in parts of the system, to perform normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination and endurance.  The functional loss may be due to absence of part or all of the necessary bones, joints and muscles, or associated structures, or to deformity, adhesions, defective innervation, or other pathology, or may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by visible behavior of the claimant undertaking the motion.  Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part which becomes painful on use must be regarded as disabled.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); 38 C.F.R. § 4.40; see also 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.45, 4.59.  Although pain may be a cause or manifestation of functional loss, limitation of motion due to pain is not necessarily rated at the same level as functional loss where motion is impeded.  See Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011).

The Veteran's low back disability is rated under DC 5242, which is rated according to The General Rating Formula for evaluating the spine.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  The General Rating Formula provides for a 10 percent disability rating for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  A 20 percent disability rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent disability rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 50 percent disability rating is assigned for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  A 100 percent rating is warranted for unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine.

Following the rating criteria, Note 1 states: evaluate any associated objective neurologic abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, separately, under an appropriate DC.

Under the Formula for Rating IVDS Based on Incapacitating Episodes, a 10 percent rating is warranted with incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 1 week but less than 2 weeks during the past 12 months; a 20 percent rating is warranted for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least two weeks but less than four weeks during the past 12 months; a 40 percent rating is warranted for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least four weeks but less than six weeks during the past 12 months; and a 60 percent rating is warranted for incapacitating episodes having a total duration of at least 6 weeks during the past 12 months.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5243.  Effective February 7, 2021, the DCs pertaining to the lumbar spine were amended.  For purposes of this decision, the applicable rating criteria for those DCs did not materially change.  See 85 Fed. Reg. 76453 (Nov. 30, 2020) (as corrected at 85 Fed. Reg. 85523 (Dec. 29, 2020), as corrected at 86 Fed. Reg. 8142 (Feb. 4, 2021)). 

The Veteran's right lower extremity radiculopathy is rated under DC 8620.  Under DC 8620, a 10 percent rating is warranted where there is mild incomplete paralysis of the nerve; a 20 percent rating is warranted where there is moderate incomplete paralysis of the nerve; a 40 percent rating is warranted where there is moderately severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve; a rating of 60 percent is warranted for severe incomplete paralysis of the nerve, with marked muscular atrophy; and the highest rating of 80 percent is warranted with complete paralysis of the nerve, the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8620.  When involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  

Merriam-Webster dictionary defines "moderate" is defined as tending toward the mean or average amount or dimension and "severe" is defined as "of a great degree."  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moderate; www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/severe.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  When, after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

Analysis

The Veteran filed a claim of service connection for a back disability on November 27, 2023.  In a statement submitted at this time, he reported that he experiences back symptoms when exercising.  He also reported that during cold weather he can barely walk and has difficulty entering or leaving a vehicle.

The Veteran was afforded a VA back examination in February 2024.  The Veteran reported being treated by physical therapy and epidural steroid injections during service.  He also reported experiencing daily flareups of moderate symptoms that are precipitated by overuse and alleviated by rest and steroid injections.  He further reported functional impairment of difficulty with bending and standing too long.  The examiner reviewed the claims file and examined the Veteran.  The examiner reported active and passive ranges of motion of forward flexion to 85 degrees, extension to 25 degrees, right and left lateral flexion to 30 degrees each, and right and left lateral rotation to 30 degrees each, with pain at the endpoints of the flexion and extension ranges of motion.  The examiner also reported pain on weight-bearing, but not on nonweight-bearing.  The examiner noted difficulty with standing for too long and sitting for too long.  The examiner denied additional loss of range of motion on three repetitions of testing.  The examiner estimated additional reduction in ranges of motion due to pain on repeated use over time of forward flexion to 75 degrees, extension to 25 degrees, right and left lateral flexion to 30 degrees each, and right and left lateral rotation to 30 degrees each.  The examiner estimated additional reduction in ranges of motion due to pain, fatigability, and weakness during flareups of forward flexion to 70 degrees, extension to 20 degrees, right and left lateral flexion to 25 degrees each, and right and left lateral rotation to 25 degrees each.  The examiner denied the presence of crepitus, guarding, muscle spasms, ankylosis, episodes of IVDS resulting in prescribed bed rest, and use of assistive devices.  The examiner denied right and left lower extremity loss of reflexes, sensation to light touch, and muscle strength.  The examiner reported right lower extremity moderate paresthesia, mild intermittent pain and numbness, and pain on straight leg raise.  The examiner reported a diagnosis of right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy.  The examiner denied the presence of left lower extremity radiculopathy and any other neurologic abnormalities.  

In a December 2024 rating decision, the RO granted separate 10 percent ratings for right and left lower extremity radiculopathy effective June 18, 2024 under DC 8620.

The Board finds that an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's back disability is not warranted.  In this regard, the February 2024 examiner reviewed the claims file and examined the Veteran.  The examiner found that the Veteran's back disability resulted in painful motion, fatigability, and weakness.  However, the examiner found that, even on repeated use over time and during flareups, that the disability does not result in forward flexion limited to 60 degrees or less or combined thoracolumbar range of motion limited to 120 degrees or less, ankylosis, or IVDS requiring prescribed bed rest.  While the Veteran has indicated back stiffness with cold weather, he has not claimed and his treatment records do not indicate that he has lost all range of motion even during cold weather.  Thus, the evidence does not indicate that he has experienced functional ankylosis.  Therefore, the Veteran's impairment from this disability, even during flareups and with repetitive use over time, is contemplated by the initial 10 percent rating assigned for this disability during the period on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.71a, DC 5242; DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. at 202.  

In addition, the Board finds that an effective date of November 27, 2023, for the separate 10 percent rating for right lower extremity radiculopathy is warranted.  In this regard, the General Rating Formula for evaluating the spine states to evaluate any associated, including objective neurologic abnormalities, separately under an appropriate DC.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  In this case, the February 2024 examiner reported a diagnosis of right lower extremity radiculopathy of the sciatic nerve.  Therefore, the effective date for his lower extremity radiculopathy is properly assigned as of the date of the back claim.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(o)(2), 4.71a.  However, a rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted.  In this regard, the examiner denied the presence of loss of reflexes, sensation to light touch, and muscle strength.  In addition, the examiner reported mild intermittent pain and numbness and denied the presence of constant pain.  While the examiner reported that the right lower extremity paresthesia is moderate in severity, the lack of any other symptoms of moderate severity, total lack of severe symptoms, and normal reflexes, sensation to light touch, and muscle strength indicates that the functional impairment caused by this condition does not tend toward the mean or average amount of right lower extremity impairment that is required for a moderate rating.

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the evidence shows that an effective date of November 27, 2023, for the separate 10 percent rating for right lower extremity radiculopathy is warranted.  However, the evidence is persuasively against initial ratings in excess of 10 percent for lumbosacral strain with DDD and right lower extremity radiculopathy.  As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for lumbosacral strain with DDD or right lower extremity radiculopathy is not warranted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.
