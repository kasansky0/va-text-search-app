ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date (EED) of February 10, 2021, but no earlier, for a 100 percent rating for major depressive disorder (MDD) with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is granted.

Entitlement to an EED of February 10, 2021, but no earlier, for special monthly compensation (SMC) based on housebound status is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's MDD with GAD is manifested by symptoms that result in total occupational and social impairment on and after February 10, 2021.

2. The Veteran did have a 100 percent service-connected disability with additional service-connected disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent on and after February 10, 2021.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a 100 percent rating for MDD with GAD are met on and after February 10, 2021. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.125, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9434.

2. The criteria for an award of entitlement to SMC based on housebound criteria are met on and after February 10, 2021. 38 U.S.C. § 1114; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.350, 3.400. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the U.S. Army from February 4, 2011, to May 26, 2014.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a January 2024 Higher-Level Review (HLR) rating decision. The January 2024 HLR rating decision reviewed a June 2023 rating decision that: (1) granted a 100 percent rating, effective March 10, 2023, for MDD with GAD; and (2) granted entitlement to SMC based on housebound status, effective March 10, 2023. The January 2024 HLR rating decision denied EEDs for the 100 percent rating for MDD with GAD and SMC based on household status.

In May 2024, the Veteran filed a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and he elected a Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, the AOJ will readjudicate the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Applicable Law

The law regarding effective dates states that, unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, DIC, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). This statutory provision is implemented by a VA regulation, which provides that the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, or a claim reopened after final disallowance will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Here, the period on appeal dates back to the Veteran's February 10, 2021, Intent to File, and the claim of entitlement to service connection for an acquire psychiatric disorder was filed February 18, 2021. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii). The record reflects that this issue has been continuously pursued since, so the period on appeal stems from the Intent to File date of February 10, 2021, to the June 2023 rating decision. 

The Veteran is currently service connected for MDD with GAD at 50 percent from February 10, 2021, and a 100 percent from March 10, 2023. See January 2024 Rating decision and Codesheet. As noted above, the period on appeal for the claim begins on February 10, 2021. 

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that a 100 percent rating effective February 10, 2021, for service-connected MDD with GAD is warranted.

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects the ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing the Veteran's symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule). 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10. 

Under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula), the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages. Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

If there is a question as to which of two evaluations should apply, the higher rating is assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating is assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Veteran's service-connected MDD with GAD is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9434, which is the general rating formula for mental disorders.

Under the general rating formula, a 70 percent rating is warranted where there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

A 100 percent rating is warranted when there is total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication, persistent delusions or hallucinations, grossly inappropriate behavior, persistent danger of hurting self or others, intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene), disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

A review of the record demonstrates that in a May 2021 VA Mental Disorder Examination the Veteran was diagnosed with depressive disorder and the Veteran reported feeling down and depressed, a sense of hopelessness and helplessness related to chronic pain and limitations, recurrent passive suicidal thoughts with no intent, and disconnected from others. The examiner noted that the symptoms were depressed mood, chronic sleep impairment and disturbances of mood. The examiner found that the Veteran's had occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decreased work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or; symptoms controlled by medication.

In March 2023, VA received a private consultant's Vocational Assessment of the Veteran dated February 7, 2023. The consultant stated that she had reviewed the Veteran's VA claim file in its entirety and interviewed the Veteran. The consultant then opined that the Veteran has been precluded from being able to work "due to his depressive disorder since at least 02/10/2021" and that this "opinion is supported by the medical evidence of record alone." 

Pursuant to the "benefit-of-the-doubt" rule, where there is "an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter," the Veteran shall prevail upon the issue. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). Although there is evidence against the claim in the May 2021, VA Mental Disorder Examination, the Board finds that the opinion in the private consultant's Vocational Assessment places the evidence in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran had total occupational and social impairment as of February 10, 2021. As such, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for a rating of 100 percent are met throughout the entire period on appeal, beginning on February 10, 2021.

1. Entitlement to an EED of February 10, 2021, but no earlier, for SMC based on housebound status is granted.

The Veteran is seeking an EED than March 10, 2023, for SMC based on housebound criteria. See May 2024 VA Form 10182 attachment.

SMC is a statutory benefit payable in addition to the compensation a veteran receives based on the Schedule for Rating Disabilities. 38?U.S.C. §?1114. SMC rates vary depending on the specific nature of a veteran's disability picture and eligibility requires a veteran to show specific disabling conditions.   

In order to establish entitlement to SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s), a veteran must have: (1) a single service-connected disability rated as "total," and (2) additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent or more.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s)(1); 38 C.F.R. §?3.350(i)(1). The first requirement can be satisfied by a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU), but only if the TDIU award is predicated on a single disability. See Buie v. Shinseki, 24?Vet. App.?242, 249-50 (2011); see also Bradley v. Peake, 22?Vet. App.?280, 289-93 (2008). Unless a veteran has a single disability that is sufficient to warrant a TDIU rating (or a 100 percent schedular rating for a single disability), he or she does not meet the criteria for SMC under section 1114(s).

In the June 2023 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded entitlement to SMC(s)(1) with an effective date of March 10, 2023, the date he met the criteria; on that date he was granted a 100 percent rating for MDD with GAD. See June 2023 rating decision and Codesheet. 

In the instant decision on appeal, the Board has granted the Veteran an EED of February 10, 2021, for a 100 percent rating for MDD with GAD. As a result, the Veteran now meets the statutory requirements for the award of SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s)(1) as of that date, namely February 10, 2021. As such, an EED of February 10, 2021, but no earlier, is warranted for entitlement to an award of SMC based on housebound status.
