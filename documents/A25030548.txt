ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for insomnia, to include as secondary to service-connected bilateral tinnitus, is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for headaches as secondary to service-connected  bilateral tinnitus is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

1. The Veteran's insomnia is a symptom of his non service-connected psychiatric disorder.

2. The evidence does not show that the Veteran's insomnia began during or was otherwise caused or aggravated by his active service or a service-connected disability.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for insomnia, to include as secondary to service-connected bilateral tinnitus, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from July 1994 to July 1997 and in the United States Marine Corps from March 1998 to August 2002. This matter came before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2023 rating decision denying service connection for headaches and a September 2023 rating higher level review (HLR) decision of an earlier separate June 2023 rating decision denying service connection for insomnia.  These rating decisions were issued by of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO),

The rating decisions on appeal, issued in June and September 2023 were after implementation of the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), such that the AMA applies to this matter.  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, with respect to the June 2023 decision regarding headaches, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

As to the September 2023 HLR decision regarding insomnia, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for headaches, to include as secondary to bilateral tinnitus, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board also notes in his June 2024 VA Form 10182, Board Appeal, the Veteran indicated disagreement with rating decisions from February 2023, May and December 2022 and May 2009.  Those rating decisions were issued more than one year prior to June 2024 VA Form 10182.  As such, the Board finds that these issues are not before the Board in this appeal.  However, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501 if he wishes to have the agency review those matters.  This decision addresses the remaining issues.  

1. Entitlement to service connection for insomnia, to include as secondary to bilateral tinnitus 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval or air service. 38 U.S.C.§§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The evidence must show: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010). 

In addition, service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability which is shown to be proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show that a current disability exists and that the current disability was either caused by or aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310; Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

VA treatment records show that the Veteran had received mental health treatment over the years for psychiatric diagnoses, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), schizophrenia or psychosis, and substance abuse disorders with associated symptoms of insomnia or difficulty sleeping.   

In December 2022, the Veteran underwent a VA mental disorders examination and was diagnosed with unspecified depressive disorder.  The examiner noted a review of the records and the Veteran's prior treatment for various psychiatric diagnoses, none of which include insomnia.  The Veteran stated that "I don't sleep well sometimes."  The examiner opined that the Veterans insomnia is due to various psychological factors that were delineated in his report and not due to tinnitus.  

In April 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA mental health examination, at which time the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with unspecified depressive disorder.  The VA examiner opined that the insomnia symptoms were subsumed within the currently diagnosed unspecified depressive disorder.

In light of the persuasive medical opinion evidence, no underlying insomnia disability has been clinically diagnosed during the appeal period or proximate thereto. McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013). Notably, the clinical evidence shows that the Veteran's insomnia problems have been subsumed by his non-service connected psychiatric diagnoses. Thus, the most persuasive evidence does not support a finding of a current diagnosis for insomnia.  Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection for insomnia is not warranted.

The Veteran is certainly competent to report his history of insomnia symptoms and any treatment that he may have undergone. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994). However, the Veteran has not demonstrated that he has the requisite specialized knowledge to attribute his insomnia symptoms to a disability separate and distinct from his non service-connected psychiatric disabilities. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The Veteran has not presented any competent and credible evidence of a current diagnosis for insomnia, and the available evidence does not support that he has any persistent symptomatology that would suggest that he has an underlying chronic disability. Accordingly, the Veteran's assertions that he has a current diagnosis for insomnia have little probative value.  

In sum, the Board finds that the evidence in this case is neither evenly nor approximately balanced, persuasively weighing against granting service connection, as there is no evidence of a current diagnosis of insomnia.  Should the Veteran wish to file a claim regarding his psychiatric diagnoses, he is free to do so.  However, the evidence here does not support his claim for insomnia on a direct or secondary basis.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (holding that, when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application).  Therefore, his claim is denied.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for headaches claimed as secondary to  service-connected bilateral tinnitus is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he has a headache condition secondary to his service-connected tinnitus. Specifically, his tinnitus causes him stress and this often precedes his headaches.  During a headache episode, his tinnitus is louder and difficult to drown out, suggesting possible aggravation. The Veteran has submitted a medical article in support of his contentions.  

Prior to the June 2023 rating decision on appeal, the VA did not obtain an examination or opinion concerning the nature and etiology of the claimed headache disability.  In light of the above, the Board finds that the failure to obtain an examination or opinion constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and therefore a remand is required. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a); see McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain an opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding the etiology of the Veteran's headaches. If the examiner deems necessary, schedule the Veteran for an examination.

Thereafter, the examiner is asked to answer the following:

(a)	Whether the Veteran has a headache condition.

(b)	Whether any diagnosed headache condition had its onset in or is otherwise related to active service.

(b) IF NOT, whether the Veteran's headache condition was caused by the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus?

(c) IF NOT, whether the Veteran's headache condition was aggravated (increased in severity to any degree) by the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus?

The examiner should note separate opinions for causation and aggravation are required.

In addressing the matter of aggravation, the examiner should note that any increase in disability is sufficient. Ward v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 233, 239 (2019).

The examiner must be advised that the Veteran is competent to report symptoms and treatment and that his reports, including his reports as to the onset and chronic nature of his symptoms, must be considered, along with the other evidence of record, in formulating the requested opinions.

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for any opinion expressed. If an examiner is unable to reach an opinion without resort to speculation, he or she must explain the reasons for this inability and comment on whether any further tests, evidence or information would be useful in rendering an opinion.
