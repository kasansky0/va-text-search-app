ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The probative evidence of record weighs against finding that the Veteran's tinnitus is caused by, had its onset in, or is otherwise due to, his military service.

2. The probative evidence of record weighs against finding that the Veteran's hypertension is caused by, had its onset in, or is otherwise due to, his military service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus have not been met. 38 U.S.C.     §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309

2. The criteria for service connection for hypertension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active-duty service with the United States Army National Guard from September 1987 to January 1988.

This appeal comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) November 2023 rating decision of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In February 2024 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, and selected the Direct Review docket option. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence that was before the AOJ at the time of the November 2023 rating decision on appeal.

Any evidence submitted outside the permitted windows cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider the additional evidence that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and identify the evidence for the AOJ's consideration. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. To establish service connection for a disability, the Veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give benefit of the doubt to the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

The Board notes that VA has made a favorable finding that the Veteran was exposed to in-service acoustic trauma, as well as in-service exposure to hazardous occupational hazards. See November 2023 Rating Decision - Narrative. Furthermore, the Board notes that the AOJ has determined that the Veteran has been diagnosed with both tinnitus and hypertension. As these determinations fulfil the first two elements necessary to establish service connection per Shedden, the Board will not disturb these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied.

The Veteran contends that his tinnitus is caused by, or otherwise due to, his military service. See February 2024 VA Form 10182. For the reasons addressed below, the Board finds against the Veteran, and service connection is not warranted.

As noted above, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of tinnitus and has been determined to be exposed to in-service acoustic trauma in the form of weapons fire, as well as exposure to potentially hazardous toxic exposure. See November 2022 C&P Exam. Thus, the first two Shedden elements necessary to establish service connection have not been met.

However, the medical evidence shows that the Veteran's tinnitus is less likely than not due to his military service. In November 2022, the Veteran reported that his tinnitus had an onset of around 2010, which is notably more than 10 years since his active-duty service. The VA examiner at the time noted that the Veteran's tinnitus was more likely due to his bilateral hearing loss, which has not been found to be service-connected, as well as being age-related. 

In July 2023 an addendum medical opinion was obtained regarding the etiology of the Veteran's tinnitus. Once again it was found that his tinnitus is not caused by, or due to, his active-duty service. The examiner explained that while the Veteran was exposed to acoustic trauma in-service, his service treatment records (STRs) are silent for complaints of tinnitus, and his periodic hearing examinations showed "no significant change in his hearing over his time [in] service" and his "hearing tests during service were normal." See July 2023 C&P Exam. The July 2023 VA examiner also addressed the Veteran's in-service exposure to toxic hazards, nothing that the hazards the Veteran was exposed to (fire, smoke, lead, and fuel) were less likely than not the cause of his tinnitus. Instead, the examiner concluded that the Veteran's hearing difficulties are instead age-related.

The Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's statements that he is experiencing hearing difficulties. However, by his own admission, his symptoms did not begin until around 2010, well after he had stopped serving. The Veteran's lay statements, combined with the November 2022 and July 2023 VA opinions finding that his tinnitus is more likely due to aging, are such that the evidence persuasively weighs against finding that his tinnitus is caused by, due to, or otherwise related to his military service (to include exposure to potentially hazardous toxins). 

As the evidence is persuasively against the Veteran's claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, supra.

Therefore, the third Shedden element necessary to establish service connection has not been met, and the Veteran's claim must be denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied.

The Veteran claims that his hypertension is caused by, or otherwise due to, his active-duty service. See February 2024 VA Form 10182. For the reasons addressed below, the Board finds against the Veteran, and service connection is not warranted.

The Board finds that the first two Shedden elements needed to establish service connection have been met. As the AOJ noted in the rating decision on appeal, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of hypertension, and during his active-duty service he was exposed to lead, smoke, fire, and fuel. See November 2023 Rating Decision - Narrative. What is left for the Board to determine is whether there is a nexus between his current disability and his active-duty service.

The Veteran's hypertension was first diagnosed in or around November 2016, which was also when the Veteran began taking medication to treat the condition. See October 2022 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. While the Veteran's non-VA treatment records show that he has continued with his treatment since his diagnosis, his physician has not provided any opinion regarding the etiology of the disease.

In July 2023, the Veteran was seen for a VA examination to determine the etiology of his hypertension. The Veteran confirmed the onset of his condition, reporting to the examiner that he was first diagnosed in 2016. See July 2023 C&P Exam. The examiner found that the combined synergistic effect of his in-service toxin exposure were less likely than not the cause of his hypertension. The examiner noted that several studies found that while exposure to fuel can lead to some conditions of the heart and skin, there was no evidence to link fuel exposure to hypertension. Similarly, the only way for the Veteran's lead exposure to have caused "a slight increase in blood pressure" would be if he had a history of long-term ingestion of lead, which the Veteran denies and is not shown in his medical record. Rather, the examiner determined that the more likely cause of the Veteran's hypertension was age, as the condition was first diagnosed over 20 years after his active-duty service. 

The Board has not overlooked the Veteran's statements about his belief that his hypertension is the result of military service.  While the Veteran is competent (that is, qualified) to report observable symptoms, he does not have the training or credentials to provide a qualified opinion as to the cause of his condition, or whether it was related to active service.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  A causal link between any specific blood pressure readings and his current hypertension, including how to interpret a history of blood pressure readings throughout the years, is a complex medical issue because it involves medical processes that are not observable

The Board finds that the July 2023 VA negative nexus opinion opinion (concluding that the Veteran's current hypertension was not related to service) is the most probative evidence, because the examiner is qualified to provide a medical opinion about a causal link, reviewed the claims file, and (most importantly) because the examiner provided detailed explanations (rationales) for the conclusions.  See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007).  Because of this, the objective medical findings and opinions provided by the July 2023 VA examiner have been assigned significant probative weight in analyzing the claim.

In sum, the Board finds that the evidence weighs against finding that the Veteran's current hypertension is caused by, or otherwise due to, his active-duty service, and as such the third Shedden element necessary to establish service connection has not been met. As the evidence is persuasively against the Veteran's claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch, supra. 

The Veteran's claim is denied.
