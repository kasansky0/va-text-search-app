DOCKET NO. 210208-185376
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning entitlement to payment of the cost of non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical services provided on April 20, 2020, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While this appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively approved the Appellant's claim for payment of the cost of medical care provided to the Veteran on April 20, 2020.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA medical services provided on April 20, 2020, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.801. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Appellant is a non-VA healthcare provider that furnished medical care services to the Veteran. 

In February 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal electing the Evidence Submission review docket to review a decision issued by VA. 

The Appellant's claim for payment of the cost of non-VA medical care provided to the Veteran on April 20, 2020, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending. In an August 2021 letter, the AOJ advised the Appellant that the April 20, 2020, episode of care was approved after secondary clinical review. The letter explained that the claim related to this episode of care would be processed accordingly and the Appellant would receive an explanation of benefits (EOB) for each claim paid. 

The administrative action for the entire April 20, 2020, episode of care at issue in this appeal constitutes a reversal of the prior denial and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal. No determination remains with which the Appellant disagrees, and the appeal is therefore dismissed. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105(d).

If a later decision / EOB concerning this episode of care results in payment in an amount disagreeable to the Appellant, the vendor may file a separate / additional appeal of that subsequent decision.
