ORDER

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for shortness of breath with chronic cough is denied.

Entitlement to an initial rating greater than 10 percent for residual soft tissue injury, right ankle limitation of motion is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for hemorrhoids is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for laceration scar, right index finger, volar surface, distal is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for neuralgia of the median nerve (rated as right index finger laceration repair with numbness at laceration site) is remanded.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's shortness of breath with chronic cough manifested in an FEV-1 between 71 and 80 percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 71 to 80 percent, or DCLO SB of 66 to 80 percent predicted. 

2. The Veteran experienced moderate limitation of motion of his right ankle disability with dorsiflexion at 0 to 15 degrees and plantar flexion at 0 to 15 degrees at worse, even when considering additional functional loss due to repeated use over time.

3. The Veteran's hemorrhoids are no worse than moderate in severity, with evidence that such were reducible and without evidence of excessive redundant tissue, fissures, or secondary anemia. 

4. The Veteran's laceration scar, right index finger, volar surface, distal, was not painful or unstable, had no underlying soft tissue damage, covered an area less than 6 square inches, and caused no additional functional limitations. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an initial compensable disability rating for shortness of breath with chronic cough have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.96, 4.97, DCs 8866-6604.

2. The criteria for an initial rating greater than 10 percent residual soft tissue injury, right ankle, limitation of motion have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.14, 4.25, 4.45, 4.71a, DC 5271. 

3. The criteria for a compensable rating for hemorrhoids have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.321, 4.1-4.14, 4.114, DC 7336.

4. The criteria for a compensable rating for laceration scar, right index finger, volar surface, distal, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, DC 7805. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 2008 to April 2012.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in May 2023 and November 2023 and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

The Board notes that the AOJ requested the Veteran submit any relevant private treatment records or submit information with which VA can assist the Veteran in obtaining private treatment records. Required notice and information were provided in the claim form which the Veteran signed, certifying to the fact that such notice was received and further than they have included or identified relevant evidence. VA requested records for which the Veteran submitted a proper release and/or adequately identified. The duty to assist is not a one-way street. If the Veteran desires help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential in obtaining evidence. Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1991). Thus, the Board finds that VA has satisfied the duty to assist. No further notice or assistance to the Veteran is required to fulfill VA's duty to assist in development. Smith v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 227 (2000); Dela Cruz v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 143 (2001); Quartuccio v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 183 (2002).

38 C.F.R. § 3.103 provides that a Veteran, upon request, is entitled to a hearing prior to VA's adjudication of an initial or supplemental claim.  The Board observes that notice regarding the opportunity for a hearing at the AOJ was not provided in this case. In Bowen, the Court found that there was no due process violation in the denial of the Veteran's requested hearing before the AOJ because the Veteran had subsequently been offered the opportunity to have a hearing before the Board. Bowen v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 250, 253 (2012). Here, the Veteran was offered a choice of three dockets in the AMA framework to include the Board hearing docket. Although the issue in Bowen was not one of notice, the Board cannot discern a basis to find that the underlying holding and logic of Bowen would not lead to the same finding of a lack of prejudicial error under the procedure and facts of this case.

The standard set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) only permits constructive receipt of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) records that not only existed prior to the issuance of the AOJ decision on appeal, but also for which the claimant furnished sufficient information to make the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) aware of the existence of those records. Thus, the Board's consideration of VHA records is limited to the same.  Here, the Board finds that VA treatment records were obtained and reviewed consistent with 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(iii) and the AMA framework.

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period when new evidence was not allowed. As the Board is deciding the above captioned claims pertaining to the Veteran's shortness of breath, right ankle, hemorrhoids, and scar, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300. The Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

As the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for neuralgia of the median nerve (rated as right index finger laceration repair with numbness at laceration site) for further development, this additional evidence will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of that claim.

The issue of entitlement to a TDIU is part and parcel of the claims seeking increased ratings. See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).

INCREASED RATING CLAIMS

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity caused by the given disability. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.

When the appeal is from the initial rating assigned with a grant of service connection, the severity of the disability during the entire period from the grant of service connection to the present is to be considered. "Staged" ratings may be assigned for distinct periods when different levels of impairment are shown. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

For disabilities evaluated based on limitation of motion, VA is required to apply the provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, pertaining to functional impairment. The Court has instructed that in applying these regulations VA should obtain examinations in which the examiner determined whether the disability was manifested by weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, or pain. Such inquiry is not to be limited to muscles or nerves. These determinations are, if feasible, to be expressed in terms of the degree of additional range-of-motion loss due to any weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, flare-ups, or pain. DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Johnston v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 80, 84-85 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.

In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of range of motion testing "for pain on both active and passive motion [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with range of motion measurements of the opposite undamaged joint."

In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the Court held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular code, the higher rating is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining, including regarding degree of disability, is to be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for shortness of breath with chronic cough is denied.

In his December 2023 VA Form 10182 NOD, the Veteran contends that a higher rating is warranted because he lost a job because he was unable to pass pulmonary function tests (PFTs). He seeks a higher initial rating. The Board notes that the Veteran filed an intent to file a claim form on April 3, 2023, and his claim of entitlement to service connection for a respiratory condition in August 2023. The claim was granted in a November 2023 rating decision. Therefore, the period under review before the Board spans from April 3, 2023.

Legal Criteria

The Veteran's shortness of breath with chronic cough is rated under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Codes (DCs) 8866-6604.

Hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen. The hyphenated codes for the Veteran's shortness of breath reflect that an undiagnosed condition of the trachea and bronchi is the service-connected disability under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 8866 and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the basis of the rating assigned under DC 6604.

Under DC 6604, Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV-1) of 71- to 80-percent predicted value, or; the ratio of Forced Expiratory Volume in one second to Forced Vital Capacity (FEV-1/FVC) of 71 to 80 percent, or; Diffusion Capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide by the Single Breath Method (DLCO (SB)) is 66- to 80-percent predicted, is rated as 10 percent disabling. FEV-1 of 56- to 70-percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent, or DLCO (SB) 56- to 65-percent predicted, is rated 30 percent disabling. FEV-1 of 40- to 55-percent predicted, or FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, or DLCO (SB) of 40- to 55-percent predicted, or maximum oxygen consumption of 15 to 20 ml/kg/min (with cardiorespiratory limit), is rated 60 percent disabling. FEV-1 less than 40 percent of predicted value, or; FEV-1/FVC less than 40 percent, or; DLCO (SB) less than 40-percent predicted, or; maximum exercise capacity less than 15 ml/kg/min oxygen consumption (with cardiac or respiratory limitation), or; cor pulmonale (right heart failure), or; right ventricular hypertrophy, or; pulmonary hypertension (shown by Echo or cardiac catheterization), or; episode(s) of acute respiratory failure, or; requires outpatient oxygen therapy, is rated 100 percent disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97.

Ratings under DCs 6600 through 6817 and 6822 through 6847 will not be combined with each other. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (a).

Additionally, there are special provisions for the application of evaluation criteria for DCs 6600, 6603, 6604, 6825-6833, and 6840-6845. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (d). When there is a disparity between the results of different Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) (FEV-1, FVC, etc.), so that the level of evaluation would differ depending on which test result is used, use the test results that the examiner states most accurately reflect the level of disability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (d)(6). When evaluating based on PFTs, post-bronchodilator results are to be used, unless the post-bronchodilator results are poorer than the pre-bronchodilator results. In those cases, use the pre-bronchodilator results. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (d)(5). Finally, if the FEV-1 and the FVC are both greater than 100 percent, a compensable evaluation based on a decreased FEV-1/FVC ratio should not be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (d)(7).

Merits

The Board has carefully reviewed the medical evidence of record. The Veteran was afforded an August 2023 VA examination for respiratory conditions. The PFT results were as follows: pre-bronchodilator: FVC of 93 percent predicted, FEV-1 of 96 percent predicted, and FEV-1/FVC of 85 percent. DLCO (SB) was not measured. Post-bronchodilator PFTs were not indicated because the Veteran's pre-bronchodilator scores were normal. The examiner indicated the Veteran's FEV-1 score most accurately reflected his level of disability. The examiner found no evidence of cor pulmonale, right ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension, or episodes of acute respiratory failure, or the requirement for outpatient oxygen therapy.

VA treatment records are silent for any complaints of or treatment for a respiratory condition. To the extent the Veteran had any other PFT results from a private provider, they have not been identified to VA or submitted by the Veteran for review. 

Accordingly, the evidence of record is persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's respiratory disability resulted in Forced Vital Capacity in one second (FEV-1) of 71 to 80 percent predicted, or; FEV-1 to Forced Vital Capacity (FEV-1/FVC) or 71 to 80 percent, or; Diffusion Capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide by Single Breath Method (DLCO (SB)) 66 to 80 percent predicted. Accordingly, the Veteran's claim for an initial increased rating for his respiratory disability is denied.

In reaching the above conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, as the evidence is persuasively against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in this appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b).

2. Entitlement to an initial rating greater than 10 percent for residual soft tissue injury, right ankle limitation of motion is denied.

The Veteran contends that his right ankle disability is more severe than the rating assigned. In his December 2023 VA Form 10182 NOD, he notes that he twisted his ankle over 20 times in the Marine Corps. The Board notes that the Veteran filed his claim of entitlement to service connection for a right ankle disability in April 2023, which was granted in the May 2023 rating decision on appeal. Therefore, the period under review before the Board spans from April 2, 2023. He seeks a higher rating.

Legal Criteria

The Veteran's right ankle disability is currently rated 10 percent under DC 5271. Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5271, a 10 percent rating is warranted with moderate limitation of motion (less than 15 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees plantar flexion). A 20 percent rating is warranted with marked limitation of motion (less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion). 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5271.

Factual Background

The Veteran was afforded a VA ankle conditions examination in April 2023. The right ankle diagnosis assigned was right ankle residual soft tissue injury. The Veteran reported current right ankle symptoms of extreme stiffness and decreased movement. He treated his right ankle with stretching. No pain relief medication was noted. The Veteran indicated that the functional impact of his right ankle disability was inability to stand or work for prolonged periods and the inability to run which impacts his ability to work in certain occupations. The Veteran denied flareups or instability of his right ankle. 

On initial range of motion testing, the examiner reported right ankle dorsiflexion at 0 to 20 degrees and plantar flexion at 0 to 15 degrees. Passive range of motion demonstrated right ankle dorsiflexion at 0 to 20 degrees and plantar flexion at 0 to 30 degrees. There was evidence of pain on weight-bearing, active motion, and passive motion. Pain resulted in functional loss because the Veteran was unable to stand or work for prolonged periods of time. The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing with at least 3 repetitions without any additional functional loss. The examiner opined that pain and weakness would limit the Veteran's functional ability with repeated use over time of his right ankle described in degrees as right ankle dorsiflexion at 0 to 1 degrees and plantar flexion at 0 to 15 degrees. The examiner found no evidence of crepitus, muscle atrophy, or ankylosis, or any other pertinent physical findings or complications of the Veteran's right ankle disability. 

VA treatment records documented ankle joint pain.

Merits

After a careful review of the record, the Board finds that a rating greater than 10 percent is not warranted. Specifically, the competent and credible evidence of record does not indicate marked limitation of motion, even when considering the effects of repeated use over time. Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's disability more closely approximates to a 10 percent rating.

The Board has considered whether the application of another diagnostic code might result in a higher rating for the Veteran's right ankle disability. However, in that regard as there is no evidence of ankylosis, a rating under Diagnostic Code 5270 or 5272 is not warranted. Moreover, as there is no evidence of malunion or astragalectomy, a rating under Diagnostic Code 5273 or 5274 is not warranted.

In reaching this decision, the Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements in support of his claim. The Board notes that the Veteran is competent to report observations about the severity of his symptomatology. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, and 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The Board finds these lay statements to be credible and consistent with the rating assigned. To the extent he argues his symptomatology is more severe, the Veteran's statements must be weighed against the other evidence of the record. Here, the specific examination findings of a trained health care professionals and documented medical treatment records are of greater probative weight than the Veteran's more general lay assertions that a higher rating is warranted.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the assignment of a rating greater than 10 percent for a right ankle disability, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application and the Veteran's increased rating claim on appeal is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

3. Entitlement to a compensable rating for hemorrhoids is denied.

The Veteran contends that his hemorrhoids are more severe than the noncompensable rating assigned. In his December 2023 VA Form 10182 NOD, he notes that while they cannot see the hemorrhoids, they come every 15 days or so. The Board notes that the Veteran filed his claim for an increased rating for his hemorrhoids in April 2023, which was denied in the May 2023 rating decision on appeal. Therefore, the period under review before the Board spans from April 2, 2023, plus the one year look back period. See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Legal Criteria

The Veteran's service - connected hemorrhoids are rated noncompensable pursuant to Diagnostic Code (DC) 7336. Under DC 7336, hemorrhoids are assigned a zero percent rating where there is evidence of mild to moderate symptomatology. A 10 percent rating is warranted where there is evidence of large or thrombotic hemorrhoids, which are irreducible, with excessive redundant tissue, evidencing frequent recurrences. Finally, a 20 percent rating, the maximum schedular rating, is warranted where hemorrhoids are present, with persistent bleeding and secondary anemia, or with fissures. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7336.

Words such as "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe" are not defined in the Rating Schedule or in the regulations. Descriptive words such as "mild," "moderate," and "frequent" are not defined in the Rating Schedule. According to Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 999 (11th Ed. 2007), "mild" means gentle in nature or temperate. "Moderate" means limited in scope or effect. The term "frequent" means "happening at short intervals: often repeated or occurring" or "acting or returning regularly or often." Although a medical examiner's use of descriptive terminology such as "mild" is an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, it is not dispositive of an issue. The Board must evaluate all evidence in arriving at a decision regarding an increased rating. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all the evidence to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6.

Factual Background

The Veteran was afforded a VA rectum and anus conditions examination in April 2023. The diagnosis assigned was internal or external hemorrhoids The Veteran reported bleeding when using the bathroom, pain with sitting, and discomfort with walking. He indicated that he is uncomfortable daily and occasionally misses work or family activities because of it. The Veteran denied any current treatment. On physical examination, a mild hemorrhoid with pain that came and went was noted. Laboratory testing performed was within normal limits.

VA treatment records are silent for any complaints regarding hemorrhoids during the appeals period, to specifically include complaints of leakage, hemorrhoid pain, or hemorrhoid swelling.

Merits

The Board has carefully considered that evidence of record and finds that a compensable disability rating is not warranted at any time during the appeals period to include during the one year look back period. While the Veteran has a diagnosis of hemorrhoids, one mild hemorrhoid was noted on physical examination in April 2023. The Veteran has reported bleeding when using the bathroom, pain with sitting, and discomfort with walking which the VA examiner has described as mild. There is no objective medical evidence to support a finding that the Veteran also suffers from persistent bleeding and anemia or large or thrombotic hemorrhoids, which are irreducible with recessive redundant tissue to support a compensable disability rating for his disability. 

The Board has considered whether there are any other applicable diagnostic codes to maximize the Veteran's benefits. Leakage otherwise known as loss of sphincter control, is considered a separate disability, and is rated under DC 7332. The Board has considered whether a rating under DC 7332 is applicable in this instance. However, the medical evidence is silent for any finding that the Veteran has complained of or experienced leakage of any kind or any loss of sphincter control including due to his hemorrhoids. The Veteran has not contended otherwise.

In evaluating the claim for higher rating for the Veteran's hemorrhoids, the Veteran's assertions regarding his symptoms, which he is certainly competent to provide, have been considered. See, e.g., Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994); Grottveit v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 91, 93 (1993). As noted earlier, however, the criteria needed to support higher ratings require clinical findings that are within the province of trained medical professionals. See Jones v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 134, 137-138 (1994). Here, such findings do not support a compensable rating for the Veteran's hemorrhoids at any pertinent point during the period on appeal.

The Board has considered whether the Veteran's case should be referred to the Director of VA's Compensation Service for consideration of an extraschedular rating. 38 C.F.R. § 3.321 (b)(1). The threshold factor for extraschedular consideration is a finding that the evidence presents such an exceptional disability picture that the schedular ratings for that disability are inadequate when comparing the level of severity of the disability with the established criteria. If the criteria reasonably describe the disability level and symptomatology, then the disability picture is contemplated by the Rating Schedule, and the assigned rating is adequate and referral for an extraschedular rating is not required. Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111, 115 (2008).

However, the Board finds that the Veteran's symptomatology is fully addressed by the rating criteria under which the disability is rated. Here, the Veteran's hemorrhoids are manifested by mild symptoms described primarily as pain and discomfort. Such symptoms are contemplated by DC 7336. The Veteran has not demonstrated any other symptoms related to his service-connected hemorrhoids that are so far outside the norm that they would not be contemplated by the rating criteria.

Therefore, the Board finds that the rating criteria under DC 7336 reasonably describes, and is adequate to evaluate, the Veteran's disability level and symptomatology of his service-connected hemorrhoid disability. Consequently, as the threshold factor has not been satisfied, referral of this case for extraschedular consideration pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.321 (b)(1) is not warranted.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record.

For all the foregoing reasons, the Board finds there is no basis for a compensable disability rating for service-connected hemorrhoids. In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the doubt doctrine; however, as the evidence is persuasively against the assignment of a higher rating during the appeals period, that doctrine is not applicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.3.

4. Entitlement to a compensable rating for laceration scar, right index finger, volar surface, distal is denied.

The Veteran generally contends that he is entitled to a compensable disability rating for his right index finger scar.

Legal Criteria

The Veteran's right index finger scar is rated under DC 7805 for other scars (including linear scars) and other effects of scars evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7801, 7802, and 7804.

Diagnostic Code 7805 instructs that any disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-04 under an appropriate Diagnostic Code.

Merits

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively against the assignment of a compensable rating for the Veteran's scar under DC 7805 as there are no other disabling effects not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-7804.

An April 2023 VA Peripheral Nerves examination which evaluated the injury to the Veteran's right index finger showed a crescent shaped scar on the radial side of right index finger which measured 1.5 cm. in length by 0.2 cm. in width. The scar was not painful or unstable, did not have a total area equal to or greater than 39 square centimeters, and was not located on the head, face, or neck.

VA treatment records are silent for any treatment for or complaints pertaining to the Veteran's right index finger scar.

The Board has also considered the other Diagnostic Codes pertaining to scars. However, the Veteran's scar is not of the head, face, or neck, is not deep and nonlinear, and is not associated with underlying soft tissue damage. Although it is superficial and not associated with underlying soft tissue damage, it does not cover an area or areas of 144 square inches or greater. Moreover, the Veteran's scar is not unstable or painful. Therefore, DCs 7800, 7801, 7802, and 7804, are inapplicable.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes that the disability on appeal has been more severe than the assigned disability rating reflects. Moreover, the Veteran is competent to report observable symptoms, however the Veteran's treatment records do not contain complaints or treatment of symptoms of the scar that would entitle the Veteran to a compensable disability rating. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007). He does not assert, and the medical records do not show, that the Veteran's scar manifested any disabling effects not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-04.

In conclusion, the Board finds that the evidence weighs persuasively against the Veteran's claim for a compensable rating for his service-connected scar. In denying such a rating, the Board finds the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to a rating greater than 10 percent for neuralgia of the median nerve (rated as right index finger laceration repair with numbness at laceration site) is remanded.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR THE REGIONAL OFFICE (RO) ADJUDICATOR: 

Remand is required to cure a pre -decisional duty to assist error and afford the Veteran an adequate VA examination to properly assess the nature and severity of the Veteran's neuralgia of the median nerve rated as right index finger laceration repair with numbness at laceration site. In his December 2023 VA Form 10182 NOD, the Veteran stated that he cannot do activities because he cannot hold or feel [with his right dominant hand]. The Veteran was afforded a VA Peripheral Nerves Conditions examination in April 2023. He reported that he was injured in service when a box full of wire he was carrying flipped and cut his finger in half. Symptoms attributed to the Veteran's median nerve neuralgia condition included severe intermittent pain and severe numbness of the right upper extremity. On examination, the Veteran had decreased sensation to his right hand/ fingers as well as muscle involvement with reduced strength in his grip of 4 out 5 on a scale of 1 to 5. Thus, although there was some issue of muscle involvement, it is unclear whether the Veteran should be rated for such impairment in addition to the nerve rating.  The Board remands for this pre-decisional duty to assist error.

The issue of entitlement to a TDIU is raised by the record. The issue is inextricably intertwined with the remanded issues discussed above. See Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180, 183 (1991) (holding that where a decision on one issue would have a "significant impact" upon another, and that impact in turn could render any appellate review on the other claim meaningless and a waste of judicial resources, the two claims are inextricably intertwined).

THE REMAND DIRECTIVES FOLLOW

2. Obtain an opinion regarding the level of severity of the right index finger and median nerve neuralgia disabilities as of the April 2023 VA examination to specifically include an indication as to whether there is a separate compensable muscle involvement for which a disability rating is warranted.

The Board notes that the claims folder must be provided to and reviewed by the examiner for all post-remand cases per AOJ policy. See VBA Manual M21-1, Part IV.i.2.A.8.b. Thus, the examiner must specifically note that the claims folder was received and reviewed in the body of the examination report. 

3. Readjudicate.
