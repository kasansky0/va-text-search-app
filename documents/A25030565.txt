CONCLUSION OF LAW

A complete VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) requesting Board review of the issue of entitlement to payment or reimbursement for non-VA medical services provided from December 23, 2019, through December 24, 2019 (claim ID 302036400031072000) have not been received; the appeal is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.204.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

In August 2021, the Board received a VA Form 10182 completed by an employee of "Benefit Recovery" electing the Direct Review docket to review a December 2020 decision. 

The claim for payment or reimbursement of medical services provided from December 23, 2019, through December 24, 2019, was denied on the basis that the claim was filed outside of the 90-day timely filing limitation of 38 C.F.R. § 17.1004(D).  A December 2020 Explanation of Payment was directed to Baptist Memorial Hospital Tipton, the medical services provider for the treatment from December 23, 2019, through December 24, 2019, and noted the claim was denied because it was filed outside of the 90-day timely filing limitation.  See January 2023 Medical Expense Reimbursement VHA file, 11. 

A January 2023 letter directed to Baptist Memorial Hospital Tipton explained that following secondary review of medical services provided from December 23, 2019, through December 24, 2019, the denial for 38 U.S.C. § 1725 claim past 90-day timely filing was overturned, however, payment is unable to be made due to new denial under 38 U.S.C. § 1725 for 50564.  The letter further explained that there are one or more 3M edits present that cause the claim to be returned to the provider and an Explanation of Payments (EOP) will be sent detailing this decision and providing additional appeal rights.

The Board finds that Benefit Recovery is not a proper claimant that may file a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement.  38 C.F.R. § 20.204 (a Notice of Disagreement may be filed by a claimant or by his or her representative if a proper Power of Attorney is on record or accompanies such Notice of Disagreement). 

"Claimant" is generally defined under VA regulations as a person who filed a written communication requesting a determination of entitlement to a specific benefit under the laws administered by VA.  38 C.F.R. § 20.3(f), (g).  Under Part 17 of the regulations, claimants for payment or reimbursement of non-VA medical services for unauthorized treatment may include the veteran who received the services; the hospital, clinic, or community resource which provided the services; or a person other than the veteran who paid for the services.  38 C.F.R. § 17.123. 

When viewed in context of authorized non-VA medical services, health care providers include entities authorized to furnish medical services to covered veterans that enter into bid contracts to establish networks of health care providers.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 1703(c), (h); 38 C.F.R. §§ 17.4005, 17.4030.  There is no indication under the applicable law and regulations that a non-veteran entity that did not furnish the underlying medical services may be considered a claimant.  Benefit Recovery describes itself as an "industry leader in healthcare technology and revenue cycle management."  https://brsi.ai/about/ (accessed March 2025). 

The record does not reflect that Benefit Recovery is a health care provider as described in the regulations or that Benefit Recovery provided the underlying treatment on December 23, 2019, through December 24, 2019 (the care was provided by Baptist Memorial Hospital Tipton).  Moreover, Benefit Recovery is not a "representative" of the Veteran or of the hospital.  See 38?C.F.R. §§?14.627, 14.629 (related to definitions as used in regulations on representation of VA claimants and the requirements for accreditation of service organization representatives, agents, and attorneys). 

The Board finds the August 2021 VA Form 10182 filed by Benefit Recovery did not initiate appellate review.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(a), (b)(2)(A) (notices of disagreement shall be in writing, shall identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees, and may be filed by the claimant, the claimant's legal guardian, or such accredited representative, attorney, or authorized agent as may be selected by the claimant or legal guardian).  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202(a), 20.204.
