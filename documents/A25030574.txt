ORDER

The appeal regarding the issue of entitlement to Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) benefits under the provisions of Chapter 31, Title 38 of the United States Code, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On February 27, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received a VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim indicating that the Veteran wished to withdraw this appeal.  The identifying information in the document was clear that the Veteran intended to withdraw this docket and this issue.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal regarding entitlement to VR&E benefits under the provisions of Chapter 31, Title 38 of the United States Code, are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1986 to July 1989, from June 1994 to September 1994, from June 1996 to September 1996, and from January 2003 to June 2004.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 30, 2024, decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC).

In his October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), which was received by the Board in November 2024, the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission Review docket under the modernized appeal review system ("AMA").  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  That appeal was docketed by the Board as "E 241115-494426" on December 18, 2024.

Beyond the above, the Board notes that the Veteran has a 100 percent combined disability rating from August 10, 2022.

Entitlement to VR&E benefits under the provisions of Chapter 31, Title 38 of the United States Code.

On February 27, 2025, the Board received a VA Form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim indicating that the Veteran wished to withdraw this appeal.  Specifically, the Veteran indicated, "I wish to withdraw my Notice of Disagreement that was received on November 14, 2024.  I was appealing my VR&E benefits denial.  I understand what the VR&E Counselor was trying to do[,] and I agree that the physical demands to be a chef would be too demanding for my body.  While I am not treated for my neuropathy[,] I deal with it daily.  The docket number of the appeal that I wish to cancel is E 241115-494426."

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.  Appeal withdrawals must include the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran (e.g., a veteran's survivor, a guardian, or a fiduciary appointed to receive VA benefits on an individual's behalf), the applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1).

As noted above, prior to promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-4138 asking the Board to withdraw his Notice of Disagreement appealing the AOJ's August 2024 decision that denied entitlement to VR&E benefits under Chapter 31.  The VA Form 21-4138 included the Veteran's name, his appeal ID/social security number, date of birth, and contact information.  It also included the Board appeal docket number.  The Board finds that the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1) have been met.  In that regard, the February 2025 VA Form 21-4138 constitutes a valid withdrawal of the Veteran's October 2024 NOD which was received by the Board in November 2024.  The identifying information in the document was clear that the Veteran intended to withdraw this docket and this issue.

As the Veteran has withdrawn the issue on appeal, there remains no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, it is dismissed.
