REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1981 to February 1984, and from January 1991 to May 1991. He has additional service in the Army Reserves. 

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 2023 decision.  In November 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 2023 decision.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 decision and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.  

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches is remanded.

The Veteran is seeking service connection for migraine headaches. The AOJ found that the evidence establishes a current disability. The Board is bound by this favorable finding. 

Review of the Veteran's service treatment records reflect that, during an evaluation in February 1987, he reported being admitted to a hospital for headaches in April 1984. In addition, he reported severe headaches in July 1985 and complained about headaches in April 1989. The Veteran was in the Army Reserves during this period. The precise dates of the Veteran's active duty for training (ADT) and inactive duty for training (IDT) are not available. For Reserve service, service connection may only be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred or aggravated while on ACDUTRA, or for an injury incurred or aggravated during INACDUTRA. 38 U.S.C. §§ 101 (24), 106; 38 C.F.R. § 3.6. The failure to verify the specific dates of the Veteran's ADT and IDT constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error that warrants a remand. 

Remand is also required to obtain a medical examination and/or opinion pursuant to the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act). See 38 U.S.C. § 1168. The PACT Act requires that, when a veteran whose active service subjected the veteran to participation in a TERA files a claim to service connect a disability and there is evidence of such disability, VA must provide the veteran with a VA examination and obtain a medical opinion addressing the possibility of a nexus between the claimed disability and the TERA. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168 (a)(1). In this case, a December 2024 TERA memorandum indicates that the Veteran participated in a TERA during service due to his military occupation specialty. The Veteran is presumed to have been exposed to diesel fuel, gas fuel, fumes, oils, solvents, petroleum jelly, gun powder, lead, and Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile.  Thus, a remand is required to obtain a medical examination and/or opinion pursuant to the PACT Act. See 38 U.S.C. § 1168.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Take all necessary steps to obtain any orders, retirement point information, and documentation of specific dates of ADT and IDT in April 1984, July 1985, and April 1989. If attempts to obtain outstanding personnel records from the Army Reserve are exhausted, please document in the claims file that all available personnel records have been obtained.

2. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination regarding his migraine headaches. The examiner should review the claims file and answer the following question:

Are the Veteran's migraine headaches at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to the Veteran's TERAs, including exposure to toxins such as diesel fuel, gas fuel, fumes, oils, solvents, petroleum jelly, gun powder, lead, and Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile?

?

When providing this opinion, the examiner must consider: the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments; and the synergistic, combined effects of all TERA of the Veteran.
