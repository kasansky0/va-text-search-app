ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for chronic bronchitis is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had chronic bronchitis at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for establishing entitlement to service connection for chronic bronchitis has not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from August 1978 to September 1992.  

In July 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a rating decision denying service connection for the Veteran's chronic bronchitis.  The Veteran requested a Higher-Level Review (HLR) in August 2023.  The December 2023 HLR rating decision confirmed the previous denial of service connection.  In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 rating decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection for Bronchitis

The Veteran contends service connection is warranted for chronic bronchitis based on toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) during his active military service.  

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.  The Board concludes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and has not had one at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The June 2023 VA examiner determined that, while the Veteran reported experiencing symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing since 1991, the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis. The examiner considered the Veteran's TERA, as well as the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all TERA's of the Veteran, but determined there was no pathology to warrant a diagnosis or condition that could be related to the claimed exposure.  Additionally, no functional impairment of earning capacity was identified.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

The Veteran has been diagnosed with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, as well as obstructive sleep apnea, for which service connection is in effect.  VA and private medical treatment records do not contain a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis.

While the Veteran believes there is a current diagnosis of chronic bronchitis, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the competent medical evidence.

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had chronic bronchitis at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.  There is no reasonable doubt to be resolved, and the claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
