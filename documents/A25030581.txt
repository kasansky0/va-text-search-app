ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is denied.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

REFERRED

The Veteran has reasonably raised entitlement to service connection for Meniere's disease, to include as secondary to tinnitus, during the pendency on the claim for an increased rating for tinnitus.  This issue has not been adjudicated by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) and is therefore referred for initial adjudication.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the entire appeal period, the Veteran is in receipt of the maximum schedular rating for his tinnitus, and such disability did not result in symptomatology that is not contemplated by the currently assigned rating.

2. The Veteran had no worse than Level II hearing acuity in his better ear.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260.

2. The criteria for entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral hearing loss have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code 6100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from October 1972 to September 1976. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in August 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the direct docket.  On July 5, 2024, the Veteran validly changed dockets by filing a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) for the same issues and electing the evidence docket.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran and his representative with, and within 90 days of the Board's receipt of, the July 5, 2024, VA Form 10182.  38 C.F.R. § 20.303(b).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings that is based on average impairment of earning capacity. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history, and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Examination reports are to be interpreted in light of the whole recorded history, and each disability must be considered from the point of view of the veteran working or seeking work.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2.  All reasonable doubt will be resolved in the claimant's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found - a practice known as "staged" ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  Staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Id.

1. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus

The Veteran contends that the severity of his tinnitus warrants a higher rating than that currently assigned.  

The appeal period before the Board begins on February 9, 2024, the date service connection was awarded for tinnitus. 

The Veteran's tinnitus is currently rated under Diagnostic Code 6260, which provides a maximum 10 percent rating for recurrent tinnitus.  38 C.F.R. § 4.87.  For the entire appeal period, the Veteran is in receipt of the maximum rating under Diagnostic Code 6260.

To warrant a rating in excess of that already assigned for tinnitus, therefore, the evidence must show symptomatology that is not contemplated by the rating criteria.  An exceptional or unusual disability picture occurs where the diagnostic criteria do not reasonably describe or contemplate the severity and symptomatology of a veteran's service-connected disability.  Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111, 115 (2008).  If there is an exceptional or unusual disability picture, the Board must consider whether the disability picture exhibits other factors such as marked interference with employment and frequent periods of hospitalization.  Id. at 115-116.  When those two elements are met, the appeal must be referred for consideration of the assignment of an extraschedular rating to the Chief Benefits Director or the Director, Compensation and Pension Service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b)(1).  Otherwise, the schedular evaluation is adequate, and referral is not required.  Thun, 22 Vet. App. at 116.

Here, the Board finds the Veteran does not report symptomatology associated with tinnitus not contemplated by the rating criteria.  

During the March 1, 2024, VA examination, the Veteran reported his tinnitus manifested as a high pitched hum that fluctuated in severity with vertigo and Meniere's disease.  He described the functional impact as difficulty with concentrating, falling asleep, and focusing on tasks at work.  

During the March 19, 2024, VA examination, the Veteran reported constant tinnitus that is sometimes very severe.  

The Veteran stated in April 2024 that his tinnitus is worsening and has caused "menieres which is sometimes debilitating."  In July 2024, the Veteran submitted a statement that his tinnitus is closely linked to his Meniere's disease, and that his "tinnitus morphs into vertigo" which then turn into Meniere's disease attacks causing vomiting, dizziness, and disorientation.  

In this case, the Board finds pertinent that the rating criteria under Diagnostic Code 6260 provide for recurrent tinnitus, which includes such aforementioned symptomatology as high pitched ringing and considers the resulting impairment.  Further, the record, to include the Veteran's lay statements found in his formal filings, does not reflect any additional symptomatology related to his tinnitus, and he has not asserted a higher rating is warranted based on his tinnitus alone.  As such, referral for consideration of an extraschedular rating is not warranted, and the 10 percent rating assigned for the Veteran's tinnitus is proper.      

Nevertheless, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran has asserted that he has more severe symptoms including vertigo, vomiting, and disorientation, related to Meniere's disease, that he asserts is caused by his service-connected tinnitus.  Upon review of the evidence, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for Meniere's disease, to include as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus, has been reasonably raised by the evidence of record.  

Accordingly, the Board finds that the issue of entitlement to service connection for Meniere's disease, to include as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus has been reasonably raised by the record, is properly before the Board, and is discussed in further detail below. 

The Board has considered whether staged ratings under Fenderson, supra, are appropriate for the Veteran's service-connected disabilities on appeal; however, the Board finds that his symptomatology has been stable throughout the appeal period.  Therefore, assigning staged ratings is not warranted.  Furthermore, neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, with regard to the increased rating claim adjudicated herein.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

In sum, the Board finds a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is not warranted.  In reaching such determination, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, the competent, probative evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim.  Therefore, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal, and his increased rating claim must be denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral hearing loss.

The Veteran contends that the severity of his bilateral hearing loss warrants a higher rating than that currently assigned.  

The appeal period before the Board begins on February 9, 2024, the date service connection was awarded for bilateral hearing loss. 

For the entire appeal period, the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss disability has been assigned a 10 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

Ratings of hearing loss range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of speech discrimination tests combined with the average hearing threshold levels as measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second.  To rate the degree of disability for service-connected hearing loss, the Rating Schedule has established eleven auditory acuity levels, designated from Level I, for essentially normal acuity, through Level XI, for profound deafness.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85(h), Table VI.  In order to establish entitlement to a compensable rating for hearing loss, it must be shown that certain minimum levels of the combination of the percentage of speech discrimination loss and average pure tone decibel loss are met.  The assignment of disability ratings for hearing impairment is derived by a mechanical application of the Rating Schedule to the numeric designations assigned after audiometric evaluations are rendered.  Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345, 349 (1992).

The criteria for rating hearing impairment use controlled speech discrimination tests (Maryland CNC) together with the results of pure tone audiometry tests.  These results are then charted on Table VI, or Table VIA in exceptional cases as described in 38 C.F.R. § 4.86, and Table VII, as set out in the Rating Schedule.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85.  An exceptional pattern of hearing loss occurs when the pure tone threshold at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz is 55 decibels or more, or when the pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86.  

At the March 1, 2024, VA examination, audiometric testing revealed the following pure tone thresholds in decibels at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz, respectively: 55, 70, 80, and 75 in the right ear, and 25, 50, 75, and 70 in the left ear.  An exceptional pattern of hearing loss was shown in the right ear.  The examiner noted that the pure tone threshold average was 70 decibels in the right ear and 55 decibels in the left ear.  Speech discrimination scores were 52 percent in the right ear and 90 percent in the left ear.  These audiometry test results equate to Level VIII hearing acuity in the right ear and Level II hearing acuity in the left ear pursuant to Table VI.  Although the Veteran shows a pattern of exceptional hearing loss, under Table VIA for the right ear, Level VI hearing acuity is demonstrated, which is lower than the value found under Table VI.  Therefore. when applying the percentage ratings for hearing impairment found in Table VII, the Veteran's right ear will be considered as having Level VIII hearing acuity.

At the March 19, 2024, VA examination, audiometric testing revealed the following pure tone thresholds in decibels at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz, respectively: 60, 65, 80, and 70 in the right ear, and 20, 55, 65, and 75 in the left ear.  An exceptional pattern of hearing loss was shown in the right ear.  The examiner noted that the pure tone threshold average was 68 decibels in the right ear and 53.75 decibels in the left ear.  Speech discrimination scores were 70 percent in the right ear and 90 percent in the left ear.  These audiometry test results equate to Level VI hearing acuity in the right ear and Level II hearing acuity in the left ear pursuant to Table VI.  Although the Veteran shows a pattern of exceptional hearing loss, under Table VIA for the right ear, Level V hearing acuity is demonstrated, which is lower than the value found under Table VI.  Therefore. when applying the percentage ratings for hearing impairment found in Table VII, the Veteran's right ear will be considered as having Level VI hearing acuity.

On application of the percentage ratings for hearing impairment found in Table VII, the Veteran's hearing impairment at each examination results in the assignment of a 10 percent rating, as the maximum rating for hearing loss where the ear with less severe hearing loss has Level II hearing acuity is 10 percent. 

To the extent the Veteran contends his bilateral hearing loss is more severe, the Board observes that the Veteran, while competent to report symptoms capable of lay observation, such as difficulty hearing, is not competent to report that his hearing acuity is of sufficient severity to warrant an increased rating under VA's tables for rating hearing loss disabilities because such an opinion requires medical expertise (training in evaluating hearing impairment), which he has not been shown to possess.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002); Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007).

Despite the foregoing, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's reports of difficulties associated with his bilateral hearing loss.  However, even after considering such contentions as to the effects of the disability on his daily life, the Board finds that the criteria for a compensable evaluation are not met.  See Lendenmann, supra.  In this regard, in Doucette, 28 Vet. App. 366, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the rating criteria for hearing loss contemplate the functional effects of decreased hearing and difficulty understanding speech in an everyday work environment as these are the effects that VA's audiometric tests are designed to measure.  The Veteran has not otherwise described functional effects that are considered exceptional or that are not otherwise contemplated by the assigned evaluation.  Id.  Thus, his complete disability picture is compensated under the rating schedule.

The Board has also considered whether staged ratings under Hart, supra, are appropriate for the Veteran's service-connected bilateral hearing loss prior to July 10, 2020; however, the Board finds that his symptomatology has been stable throughout the appeal period.  Therefore, assigning staged ratings for such disability is not warranted.  Further, neither the Veteran nor his representative have raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record, in regard to the increased rating claim decided herein.  Doucette, supra.

In sum, the Board finds a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss is not warranted.  In reaching such determination, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, the competent, probative evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim.  Therefore, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal, and his increased rating claim must be denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.
