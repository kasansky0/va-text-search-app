ORDER

An effective date prior to January 2, 2019, for the award of service connection for major neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

There were no reasonably raised claims for service connection for major neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder prior to January 2, 2019.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date prior to January 2, 2019, for the award of service connection for major neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1976 to November 1979.

The case is on appeal from a June 2023 rating decision.

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a March 2023 rating decision.  In June 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior March 2023 decision.  

In the July 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).

An effective date prior to January 2, 2019 for the award of service connection for major neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder.

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after a final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  If a claim is filed within one year after separation from service, service connection will be effective as of the day after separation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  Otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.

The essential elements for any claim, whether formal or informal, are "(1) an intent to apply for benefits, (2) an identification of the benefits sought, and (3) a communication in writing."  Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009); see 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.  Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended the claims filing process to require the filing of proper standard forms.

Effective March 24, 2015, the law no longer allows for informal claims and the pertinent regulations allow a claimant to submit an Intent to File a Claim form, and VA may recognize the receipt date of the Intent to File form as the date of claim so long as VA receives the successfully completed claim form within a year.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  However, if submitted in writing, the Intent to File must be on a standardized form.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(1)(ii).  If not on a standardized Intent to File form, then any communication "is considered a request for an application form for benefits" and has no impact on effective dates, which is governed based upon when the formal claim is received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).

VA must adjudicate all claims "reasonably raised by a liberal reading" of all evidence and pleadings in a claims file, although a claim must be reasonably raised by the evidence.  See Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 85, 88 (2009).  A claimant must identify the benefit sought by describing the nature of the claimed disability.  See Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 256 (2007).  This is accomplished by reference "to a body part or system that is disabled or by describing symptoms of the disability."  See DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 53 (2011); Brokowski, 23 Vet. App. at 86-87.  Also, if a claim is submitted that does not identify the nature of the claimed disability, but is submitted with medical records "clearly discuss[ing] disabilities or specific symptoms other than those listed on the application, it may be inferred" that the claimant intended to claim disorders suggested by medical records.  See Brokowski, 23 Vet. App. at 88 [emphasis in original].

A claimant's intent in filing a claim is paramount to construing the breadth of the claim.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009).  VA "has no duty to read the mind of a claimant." See id.  The claimant's later actions are not evidence of their earlier intent, which "has no support in law or logic."  Myers v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 228, 233 (2002).

While a pro se claimant's claim must identify the benefit sought, the identification need not be explicit in the claim-stating documents, but can also be found indirectly through examination of evidence to which those documents themselves point when sympathetically read.  Shea v. Wilkie, 926 F.3d 1362, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2019).  An informal claim may be raised by language that points to records mentioning a condition in a way that, sympathetically read, is properly understood as seeking benefits for such a condition.  Id. at 1370.  Where a claimant's filings refer to specific medical records, and those records contain a reasonably ascertainable diagnosis of a disability, the claimant has raised an informal claim for that disability under § 3.155(a).  Id.

However, a veteran's legally sufficient claim must provide information, even at a high level of generality, to identify the sickness, disease, or injury for which benefits are sought.  Sellers v. Wilkie, 965 F.3d 1328, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2020).

In secondary service connection claims, the effective date can be no earlier than the date of the claim for service connection on a secondary basis.  See Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (noting that effective dates for primary and secondary conditions are afforded the same treatment under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 and that secondary conditions arise at the same time or after primary conditions).

Analysis

The Veteran is seeking an effective date prior to January 2, 2019 for the award of service connection for major neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder, as secondary to service-connected cerebral infarction.  In this regard, the Veteran's representative contends that the effective date should be January 23, 2010, the original date of a claim for service connection for hypertension.  The representative argues the claim for major neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder was raised by the record at the time of the claim for service connection for hypertension, as a secondary service connection claim.  

The Board finds an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for major neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder is not warranted.  

A review of the record reflects that the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for hypertension on January 27, 2010, which was granted in a March 2016 Board decision.  The implementing rating decision was issued in April 2017 and assigned a 10 percent rating effective January 27, 2010.  The Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) to express disagreement with the assigned rating on August 3, 2017.  A Statement of the Case concerning this was issued in December 2017 and the Veteran filed a substantive appeal on January 16, 2018.  The Board remanded the claim for additional development in November 2018 and issued a decision in July 2020 which assigning staged ratings.  

While that claim was pending, and prior to the issuance of the July 2020 Board decision which assigned staged ratings concerning the Veteran's hypertension, the Veteran submitted an Intent to File on January 2, 2019.  On May 21, 2019, the Veteran submitted a formal claim for stroke secondary to his service-connected hypertension.  The claim was granted in an August 2021 Board decision and was characterized as a grant of service connection for cerebral infarction with residuals.  The Veteran submitted a Supplemental claim on February 16, 2022, disagreeing with the initial rating for cerebral infarction with residuals.  On the same day, the Veteran submitted an Intent to File.  A March 2023 rating decision granted service connection for major cognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder as secondary to the service-connected cerebral infarction effective February 16, 2022.  The Veteran filed a request for Higher-Level Review concerning the effective date on March 21, 2023.  A June 2023 rating decision was issued, in which an earlier effective date of January 2, 2019 was assigned based on the date VA received the intent to file, which was deemed to be associated with the claim received for a stroke secondary to service connected hypertension.  

The Board finds an effective date for the award of service connection for major neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder as secondary to service-connected cerebral infarction prior to the assigned date of January 2, 2019, is not warranted.  Initially, the Board notes that service connection cannot be established as secondary to a non-service-connected disability.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.310.  Though a secondary condition may have its onset before the effective date of the award for service connection for or diagnosis of the primary condition, Frost v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 131 (2017), it would be illogical for a secondary disability to have an effective date prior to the effective date of service connection for the primary disability.  See Ellington, 541 F.3d at 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (noting (1) that effective dates for primary and secondary conditions be afforded the same treatment under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 and (2) that secondary conditions arise at the same time or after primary conditions).  

In this case, as the grant of service connection for the Veteran's cerebral infarction with residuals became effective on January 2, 2019, the effective date for the Veteran's neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder which was granted as secondary to service-connected cerebral infarction with residuals cannot be earlier than the effective date for the grant of service connection for cerebral infarction with residuals currently assigned date of January 2, 2019.  Consequently, the date entitlement arose for the Veteran's neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder was January 2, 2019, the currently assigned effective date.  It is unnecessary to determine whether the date of claim was prior to January 2, 2019, as the date entitlement arose would be the later of the two and, hence, the correct effective date.  The earliest possible effective date the Veteran may receive for the award of service connection for neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder is therefore January 2, 2019.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  The appeal is denied.

Although it is unnecessary to determine whether the date of claim is prior to January 2, 2019, the Board acknowledges the Veteran's representative's contention that the claim for major neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder was raised by the record at the time of the claim for service connection for hypertension, which was filed on January 23, 2010, as a secondary service connection claim.  In support of this contention, the Veteran's representative cited Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188 (2021), which held that when entitlement to secondary service connection for non-voiding and non-renal residuals was raised while VA was evaluating service-connected prostate cancer, the claimant need not file a separate, formal claim for secondary service connection for those residuals.  However, this case is distinguishable from Bailey.  In Bailey, the Veteran was seeking an increased rating for prostate cancer and the claims for non-voiding and non-renal residuals of prostate cancer were raised based on evidence of a secondary relationship between the conditions.  However, in this case, a secondary relationship between hypertension and major neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder is not established, as the Veteran's major neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder was granted as secondary to his cerebral infarction with residuals, rather than hypertension, and there is no evidence the Veteran's major neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder is secondary to his hypertension.  Specifically, a March 2017 VA examination report concerning the Veteran's hypertension does not mention the presence of this condition.  

Moreover, the Board finds there was no basis to find a formal or informal claim for service connection for major neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder was filed prior to January 1, 2019.  In this regard, the January 23, 2010, claim for service connection for hypertension did not raise a claim for major neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder.  The Board notes that a veteran's legally sufficient claim must provide information, even at a high level of generality, to identify the sickness, disease, or injury for which benefits are sought.  See Sellers, 965 F.3d at 1337.  The Veteran filed an original claim for service connection for hypertension and migraines in February 2010.  The claim form filed in February 2010 claim form explicitly referenced hypertension and migraines, which the Veteran reported began during active duty and for which he currently took medication.  The claim does not refer to a neurocognitive or psychiatric disorder.  Thus, the claim did not expressly raise a claim for service connection for a neurocognitive or psychiatric disorder even with a "high level of generality."  See Sellers, 965 F.3d at 1337.  

The Board also recognizes that the identification of a claim can be made indirectly through examination of evidence to which the claim documents themselves point when sympathetically read.  Shea, 926 F.3d at 1369.  VA must look beyond the four corners of those documents when the documents themselves point elsewhere, including to medical records. Id. at 1368-69.  An informal claim may be raised by language that points to records mentioning a condition in a way that, sympathetically read, is properly understood as seeking benefits for such a condition.  Id. at 1370.  Hence, where a claimant's filings refer to specific medical records, and those records contain a reasonably ascertainable diagnosis of a disability, the claimant has raised an informal claim for that disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  Id.   

In this regard, at the time the Veteran filed a claim for hypertension and migraines, he reported that he received treatment for those conditions at East Coast Medical.  The Board acknowledges those records include a diagnosis of depression noted on a treatment record dated in February 2010.  Here, however, this record only documents a diagnosis of depression.  There is no indication in the records that there was an etiological relationship between depression and hypertension.  The Board does not find that, even sympathetically reading the records it can extrapolate an informal claim for service connection from a notation that provides no indication whatsoever that the disability being treated is etiologically linked to the one for which service connection is being claimed so as to constitute an informal claim.  

In addition, other filings by the Veteran after the January 23, 2010 Intent to File and prior to the January 1, 2019 Intent to File do not constitute a claim for major neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder.  In this regard, those filings are limited requests for documents and procedural documents related to the Veteran's claim for service connection for hypertension.  Thus, there was not an earlier claim for major neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder.

In light of the foregoing, the evidence is persuasively against the claim and the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  Accordingly, an effective date prior to January 2, 2019, for the award of service connection for major neurocognitive disorder and unspecified depressive disorder is not warranted.
