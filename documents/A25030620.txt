ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than to October 12, 2021, for the award of a 10 percent disability rating for tinnitus is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than October 12, 2022, for the assignment of a 30 percent disability rating for bilateral temporomandibular joint disorder is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's original claims for service connection for tinnitus and bilateral temporomandibular joint disorder were granted with an initial noncompensable disability rating for tinnitus and an initial 10 percent disability rating for temporomandibular joint disorder in a December 1993 rating decision.

2. The Veteran and his then-representative were notified of the decision and provided notice of his procedural and appellate rights by a December 29, 1993, letter.

3. The Veteran did not disagree or appeal the December 1993 Rating Decision, submit additional evidence within one year of the decision, nor did VA constructively possess any additional evidence within one year of the decision.

4. The Veteran's next-in-time claims for disability compensation for tinnitus and temporomandibular joint disorder were received by VA on October 21, 2022.

5. The increase in frequency, severity, and duration of the Veteran's bilateral temporomandibular joint disorder and tinnitus did not become factually ascertainable in the year before October 12, 2022.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The December 1993 rating decision is final. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5108, 7105 (1992); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103 (1993).

2. The criteria for an effective date for an increased disability rating of 10 percent for tinnitus earlier than October 12, 2021, are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

3. The criteria for an effective date for an increased disability rating of 30 percent for bilateral temporomandibular joint disorder earlier than October 12, 2022, are not met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Army honorably for multiple periods, most recently from January 2001 to June 2011.

These issues come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 Rating Decision, issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regional office, which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the January 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for increased disability ratings for tinnitus and temporomandibular joint disorder.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to an earlier effective date for his tinnitus, which was increased from 0 to 10 percent, presently assigned an effective date of October 12, 2021, and for the increase from 10 to 30 percent for temporomandibular joint disorder, presently assigned an effective date of October 12, 2022. See January 2024 Notice of Disagreement; January 2024 Rating Decision. 

According to applicable law and regulation, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of compensation based upon an original claim will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The date of entitlement to an award of service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service. Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

The effective date for an increased evaluation for a service-connected disorder is generally the date the claim was received or when entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1). However, compensation can also be awarded up to one year before the date of claim, provided the claim for an increased disability rating was received within one year of the increase in disability, as shown by the evidence. That is to say, the effective date of such an increase would then be the date the increase was "factually ascertainable." If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective on the date of claim. If the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date is the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a) and (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1)(2). 

Regarding the date of entitlement, the term "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statute or regulation. However, the Court has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought. These "facts found" include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested (i.e., the date entitlement arose if it is after the claim was filed). See Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

Here, the Veteran's original tinnitus and temporomandibular joint disorder claims were granted in December 1993 with an initial disability rating of 0 percent disabling for tinnitus and 10 percent for temporomandibular joint disorder. See December 1993 Rating Decision. The Veteran was notified of the decision and provided notice of his procedural and appellate rights in a December 29, 1993, letter. See December 1993 Notification Letter. No disagreement with the decision was received by VA in the year following the December 1993 notice. No additional evidence was received by VA in the year following the December 1993 notice. 

The Board concludes that the December 1993 Rating Decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103. As a result, the Board looks to the next-in-time claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). 

The Veteran's next disability compensation filing was received by VA on October 12, 2022. The AOJ awarded increased disability ratings for both disabilities initially as effective October 12, 2022. In a subsequent Higher-Level Review of the effective date, the AOJ awarded an earlier effective date of October 12, 2021, solely for the tinnitus rating. 

The Veteran's attorney, in correspondence with AOJ personnel, made two arguments, first that the 1993 claim should be reconsidered based on new service department records received by VA in August 2011, and in the alternative, that the new service department records were either an informal claim for benefits, or that VA had a duty to "invite" a claim based on the receipt of those records. December 2023 Email Correspondence. For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that each argument fails. 

First, the Board concludes that reconsideration of the Veteran's original 1993 claim for disability compensation is not warranted. If at any time after VA issues a decision on a claim, VA receives or associates with the claims file relevant official service department records that existed and had not been associated with the claims file when VA first decided the claim, VA will reconsider the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(1). Such records include (i) service records that are related to a claimed in-service event, injury, or disease, regardless of whether such records mention the appellant by name; (ii) additional service records forwarded by the Department of Defense or the service department to VA any time after VA's original request for service records; and (iii) declassified records that could not have been obtained because the records were classified when VA decided the claim. Id. These provisions do not apply to records that VA could not have obtained when deciding the earlier claim, including because the records did not exist at the time. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(2).

The service department records pertain entirely to periods of service which began after the 1993 rating decision and are dated after the 1993 rating decision. Thus, the Board finds that these records did not exist at the time of the 1993 rating decision. Reconsideration of the 1993 rating decision is not warranted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(c)(2).

Next, the Veteran's attorney also argued in the same correspondence that the records constituted an informal claim for benefits as they were notice that he was discharged from active duty, referring to 38 C.F.R. § 3.654(b)(2). The regulation cited concerns the resumption of disability compensation payments after a period of active service based on either notice from the Department of Defense that the beneficiary had left active duty and stopped receiving active service pay or based on a claim from the beneficiary. Receipt of those records could constitute the notice to resume disability payments, however, that is not the issue on appeal in this case. Instead, the Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the increase in his disability payments. Moreover, the regulation treats notice from the Defense Department as distinct from claims filed by beneficiaries. Thus, the plain language of the regulation prevents treating notice from the Defense Department as a "claim" of any sort. 

The receipt of the records also does not create in VA an obligation to "invite" a claim. First, the Veteran offers no support for this proposition. The Board is left to speculate as to the meaning of this term. The Board rejects the argument that the newly created service treatment records constitute an informal claim. Prior to March 24, 2015, VA recognized formal and informal claims. In this regard, any communication or action, indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, from a claimant, his or her duly authorized representative, a Member of Congress, or some person acting as next friend of a claimant who is not sui juris may be considered an informal claim. Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155. An informal claim requires the submission of something indicating an intent to seek an identifiable benefit, which did not occur here, and thus the argument fails. See Merritt v. Wilkie, 965 F.3d 1357, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2020). The mere transfer of records is not a claim. This is particularly true where, as discussed above, regulation treats Defense Department notices as different from claims. 

VA does have statutory obligations to provide claim forms to those individuals expressing an interest in filing claims. 38 U.S.C. § 5102. This obligation is triggered by an individual's contact with VA. This was accomplished by the informal claims rubric that existed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 in 2011. As discussed, however, the Veteran does not argue that he contacted VA in 2011. Accordingly, VA had no duty to "invite" the Veteran to file a claim at that time. 

In light of the foregoing, the Board finds the Veteran's arguments regarding both reconsideration of the 1993 claim and a date of claim of August 2011 without merit. The Veteran's next-in-time claim for disability compensation for both tinnitus and temporomandibular joint disorder was received by VA on October 12, 2022. 

The AOJ awarded an effective date for the increased rating for tinnitus one year prior to the filing because the increase was based on a change in the rating schedule concerning tinnitus, on the basis of 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a). As it is one year prior to the filing of the claim, it already covers the one year look back period for increased disability claims, which is generally the earliest possible effective date for the increased disability rating. 

Accordingly, the appeal for an earlier effective date, prior to October 12, 2021, for an increased disability rating for tinnitus is not warranted and is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1). 

The Veteran contends he is entitled to an earlier effective date for his bilateral temporomandibular joint disorder, which was increased from 10 to 30 percent, with an effective date of October 12, 2022. See January 2024 Notice of Disagreement; January 2024 Rating Decision.

Here, the Veteran's original bilateral temporomandibular joint disorder claim was granted in December 1993 with a 10 percent disability rating. See December 1993 Rating Decision. The rating schedule for the disability was changed effective February 17, 1994, and again effective September 10, 2017. See 59 Fed. Reg. 2529, 2530 (Jan. 18, 1994); see also 82 Fed. Reg. 36080, 36085 (Aug. 3, 2017). To be entitled to a retroactive award as with tinnitus, the evidence must show that the claimant met all eligibility criteria for the liberalized benefit on the effective date of the liberalizing law or VA issue and that such eligibility existed continuously from that date to the date of claim or administrative determination of entitlement. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a). The 1994 change modified diagnostic code 9905 by changing the limitation of motion needed to qualify for the differing compensation levels. The 2017 change added dietary restrictions to the range of motion findings needed for each compensation level. 

The Veteran's next bilateral temporomandibular joint disorder filing was an October 12, 2022, increased disability rating claim. The AOJ awarded his increased disability rating for bilateral temporomandibular joint disorder from 10 to 30 percent effective October 12, 2022. See October 2022 VA 21-526EZ; January 2023 Rating Decision. The Veteran had a November 1993 VA examination in connection with that claim. At the time, he reported decreased range of motion which was not measured. An x-ray report indicated that he had "good" range of mandibular motion. No findings of measurements of the limitation of motion were recorded. The Veteran's service treatment records received in 2011 also do not record any limitation of jaw movement.  

The Board concludes that October 12, 2022, is the proper date of claim. Next, the Board turns to the question of when it first became factually ascertainable that the Veteran's bilateral temporomandibular joint disorder increased in severity. The Veteran has not submitted evidence of an increase in the severity of his symptoms occurring in the year prior to filing his claim in October 2022. 

It does not appear the Veteran was being treated by VA and as such VA treatment records up to one year prior to October 2022 are silent for any symptoms, complaints, or treatment records concerning the severity, frequency, or duration of the Veteran's bilateral temporomandibular joint disorder symptoms. The Veteran did not submit any private treatment records to support a finding that the severity, frequency, or duration of his symptoms increased in the year prior to his filing. 

Although the Veteran reported as his November 2022 bilateral temporomandibular joint disorder VA examination that his flare ups occur 2-3 times a year, there is no other evidence to connect an increase in his symptoms with a particular date or time frame within the one year of his filing of the claim in order to award an earlier effective date. See November 2022 C&P Exam. 

Finally, the record does not establish that the Veteran's degree of disability met the criteria for a compensable rating when adopted in 1994 or in 2017. The evidence of record from 1993 is simply too vague as to limitation of joint motion to meet the criteria adopted in 1994. Similarly, there was no evidence at that time that the dietary restrictions were met in 2017. The Veteran has offered no argument that they did. 

As such, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against a finding that the increased disability rating for the Veteran's bilateral temporomandibular joint disorder was factually ascertainable within one year of the October 2022 claim. As such, October 12, 2022, is the date of the claim and the earliest warranted effective date provided by law. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(i); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q)(2). Therefore, the appeal for entitlement to an earlier effective date for bilateral temporomandibular 

joint disorder is denied.
