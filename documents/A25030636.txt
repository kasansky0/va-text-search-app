An effective date of June 8, 2023, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for chronic kidney disease is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

On June 8, 2023, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received the Veteran's intent to file a claim which was followed by the receipt of his original claim for service connection for a lacunar stroke and chronic kidney disease on April 17, 2024.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of June 8, 2023, for the award of service connection for lacunar stroke have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date of June 8, 2023, for the award of service connection for chronic kidney disease have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 1962 to May 1965, with service in the Republic of Vietnam. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued on January 15, 2025, by a VA Regional Office, herein referred to as the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). 

By way of background, service connection for lacunar stroke was awarded in a rating decision issued on September 9, 2024, and service connection for chronic kidney disease was awarded in a rating decision issued on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, the Veteran filed a Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review (HLR) (VA Form 20-0996) and requested a review of such decisions with respect to the effective dates assigned. In January 2025, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal. 

In February 2025, the Veteran submitted a timely Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) and elected the Direct Review docket. Based on such election, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2024 and December 2024 rating decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decisions, which were subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior April 17, 2024, for the award of service connection for lacunar stroke.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to April 17, 2024, for the award of service connection for chronic kidney disease.

The assignment of an effective date for an award is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on a claim for service connection or for an increase of compensation "shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefore." 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date for an award of service connection is the day after separation from service or day entitlement arose, if a claim is received within one year of separation from service, otherwise the date of receipt of claim, or the day entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i). 

A claim for VA benefits, whether formal or informal, must be in writing and must identify the benefit sought. 38 U.S.C. § 5101; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155; Rodriguez v. West, 189 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 1999); Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377 (1999). Prior to March 24, 2015, any communication or action indicating intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA, was considered an informal claim. Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought. Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).

A claimant, or certain other individuals as specified in section 3.155(b), may indicate a claimant's intent to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b). An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant. Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160 (a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b).

The Veteran is seeking an earlier effective date prior to April 17, 2024, for the award of service connection for lacunar stroke and chronic kidney disease. Specifically, he asserts that an effective date of June 8, 2023, is proper, which is the date VA received his intent to file a claim.

By way of background, on June 8, 2023, VA received an intent to file a claim. Thereafter, VA received a Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) on June 26, 2023, disagreeing with an April 2023 rating decision which denied service connection for his claims of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and ischemic heart disease. Thereafter, on April 17, 2024, the Veteran submitted a Fully Developed Claim (VA Form 21-526EZ) for his claims of entitlement to service connection for lacunar stroke and chronic kidney disease. 

As a general matter, only one complete claim for a benefit may be associated with each intent to file a claim for the benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d)(1)(ii). Furthermore, if a formal application for benefits is received within a year of an intent to file a claim, the date of claim for effective date purpose is the date the intent to file was received, except for supplemental claims under the AMA. Id. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Court (Federal Circuit) invalidated 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 in part, holding that if a supplemental claim is received within one year of an intent to file, the date the intent to file was received is the date of claim for the effective date purposes. See Military-Veterans Advocacy v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, 7 F.4th 1110 (Fed. Cir. July 2021) (hereinafter MVA).

Pertinently, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) recently issued a precedential decision distinguishing between a supplemental claim and an initial claim of increased rating. Notably, in Jackson v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 277 (2024), the Court observed that a supplemental claim can take multiple forms, to include preserving an original effective date if filed within a year of an AOJ decision or requesting readjudication based on new and relevant evidence if submitted more than one year after such a decision. However, the Court emphasized that in either scenario the claimant filing a supplemental claim "must have previously filed a claim for the same or similar benefits on the same or similar basis." Id. at 10. 

The issue in the instant case is whether the Veteran's June 2023 VA Form 20-0995 or April 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ should be construed as associated with the June 2023 intent to file a claim based on the provisions set forth in MVA.  

Here, the Board notes that the June 2023 VA Form 20-0995 was submitted within one year of the April 2023 rating decision, and specifically requested a review of such decision. Notably, the rating decision stems from a November 2022 supplemental claim requesting readjudication of claims previously denied by the AOJ. Moreover, service connection for the issues of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and ischemic heart disease noted on the June 2023 VA Form 20-0995 was awarded by the AOJ in a subsequent rating decision and assigned effective dates of August 10, 2022, February 2, 2006, and March 25, 2020, respectively. Notably, the effective dates assigned are earlier than the date of receipt of the intent to file. Here, the Board finds that, as the June 2023 VA Form 20-0995 was submitted within one year of the April 2023 rating decision, and the appeal period stems from a November 2022 supplemental claim, the Veteran was continuously pursuing his claim and preserving an original effective date. Therefore, such is not considered a formal application for benefits for the purposes of 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 and MVA. 

(continued on next page)?

Accordingly, the Board finds that the April 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ is a formal application for benefits for the issues of entitlement to service connection for lacunar stroke and entitlement to service connection for chronic kidney disease and is associated with the June 2023 intent to file a claim. Thus, as such was received within one year of the intent to file a claim, and no other formal applications were received by VA, an effective date of June 8, 2023, for such disabilities is warranted.
