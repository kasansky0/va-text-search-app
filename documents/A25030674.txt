ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for depression is dismissed.

A December 2023 reduction from a rating of 40 percent to a 10 percent rating for degenerative disc disease (DDD) of the spine was improper, and the rating is restored. 

Whether a December 2023 reduction from a rating of 60 percent rating to a 10 percent rating for dyspepsia was improper is denied.

Whether a December 2023 reduction from a rating of 50 percent rating to a 30 percent rating for migraine headaches was improper is denied.

Entitlement to an increased rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for dyspepsia and unspecified abdominal pain from March 1, 2024, is granted.

Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 60 percent for dyspepsia and unspecified abdominal pain prior to March 1, 2024, is denied.

Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 50 percent prior to March 1, 2024, and in excess of 30 percent thereafter for migraine headaches is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 40 percent for degenerative disc disease (DDD) of the spine is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For the Veteran's claim for service connection for depression, the Veteran did not timely file her VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) nor did she file an extension of time or provide good cause as to why the NOD was not filed within one-year of the September 2022 rating decision.

2. A December 2023 rating decision reduced the Veteran's rating for service-connected dyspepsia from 60 percent to 10 percent, service-connected migraine headaches from 50 percent to 30 percent, and service-connected DDD of the spine from 40 percent to 10 percent, all effective March 1, 2024.  

3. As of March 1, 2024, the ratings for DDD of the spine, dyspepsia, and migraine headaches were in effect for less than 5 years. 

4. At the time of the reduction of the disability rating of 40 percent to 10 percent for DDD of the spine, the record did not establish that a material improvement of the Veteran's service-connected spine disability had occurred which resulted in an improvement in her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life.

5. The reduction of the disability ratings for dyspepsia and migraines were proper and consistent with applicable law and regulations.

6. From March 1, 2024, the Veteran's dyspepsia has manifested to recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia, pyrosis, regurgitation, reflux, and substernal pain with occasional incapacitating episodes.

7. Prior to March 1, 2024, the Veteran was provided the maximum rating under the schedular criteria for her dyspepsia with abdominal pain. 

8. From March 1, 2024, the Veteran's migraine headaches have only manifested to characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over last several months.

9. Prior to March 1, 2024, the Veteran was provided the maximum rating allowed under the schedular criteria for her headache condition. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for depression have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

2. The criteria for the reduction of the 40 percent disability rating to 10 percent for DDD of the spine, effective March 1, 2024, was improper; the criteria for restoration of the 40 percent rating for the disability have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.344, 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5242.

3. The criteria for the reduction of the 60 percent disability rating to a 10 percent rating for dyspepsia, effective March 1, 2024, was proper; the criteria for restoration of the 60 percent rating for dyspepsia have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.344, 4.1, 4.7, 4.114, Diagnostic Codes 7309, 7346.  

4. The criteria for the reduction of the 50 percent disability rating to a 30 percent rating for migraine headaches, effective March 1, 2024, was proper; the criteria for restoration of the 50 percent rating for migraine headaches have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.344, 4.1, 4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100.

5. The criteria for an increased rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for dyspepsia and unspecified abdominal pain from March 1, 2024, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159, 4.1, 4.7, 4.114, Diagnostic Codes 7309, 7346.  

6. The criteria for an increased rating in excess of 60 percent for dyspepsia and unspecified abdominal pain prior to March 1, 2024, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159, 4.1, 4.7, 4.114, Diagnostic Codes 7309, 7346.  

7. The criteria for an increased rating in excess of 50 percent prior to March 1, 2024, and in excess of 30 percent thereafter for migraine headaches have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 2020 to April 2020.

In January 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of increased rating for degenerative disc disease of the spine, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Dismissal of Claim

Entitlement to Service Connection: Depression

On January 2, 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD).  The Veteran identified one of the issues being appealed as entitlement to service connection for depression and listed a rating decision issued on December 2, 2023, as the rating decision to be appealed.  

However, a review of the record demonstrates that neither a rating decision nor a notification letter was issued in December 2023 for her depression claim, or any other psychiatric condition.  The most recent rating decision addressing her service connection claim for depression was issued on September 21, 2022.  The Veteran was notified of this decision through a notification letter on September 23, 2022.  Thus, the January 2024 NOD appeal was submitted more than one year after the September 23, 2022, denial, which renders the appeal untimely.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.203.

The Board recognizes that the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) has previously held that the timeliness of filing is a mandatory claims-processing rule, not a jurisdictional statute.  See Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024), Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021).  The Board acknowledges that the Board may waive its objection to an untimely appeal and adjudicate a matter when there has been such a waiver or good cause.  As such, failure to file a timely appeal does not automatically foreclose an appeal, render a claim final, or deprive the Board of jurisdiction.  Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, 42 (2009).  

Here, however, the Veteran has not provided any statements or contentions of good cause for the untimely appeal, nor did she request an extension.  There has further been no documented notification issues or error on the part of the VA during this period nor has the Veteran contended such. 

Accordingly, the Board finds claims processing rules have not been properly followed, and therefore, the issue of entitlement to service connection for depression must be dismissed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203, 20.205.

Rate Reduction

Where a reduction in an evaluation of a service-connected disability is considered warranted and the lower evaluation would result in a reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments currently being made, a rating proposing the reduction or discontinuance must be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons.  In addition, the Regional Office (RO) must notify the Veteran at the Veteran's latest address that he or she has 60 days to present additional evidence showing that compensation should be continued at the present level.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e).  The procedural framework and safeguards set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 governing rating reductions are required to be followed by VA before it issues any final rating reduction.  See Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 418 (1993).

In a rating reduction, not only must it be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred, but also that the improvement actually reflects an improvement in a Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 420-21; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991).  A disability rating may not be reduced unless the evidence demonstrates that an improvement in the disability has occurred. 38 U.S.C. § 1155 (2012).  Specifically, it is necessary to ascertain, based upon a review of the entire recorded history of the condition, whether the evidence reflects an actual change in disability and whether examination reports reflecting change are based upon thorough examinations.  In addition, it must be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred and that such improvement actually reflects an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 420-21; 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (c) (2017).  In this case, the Board finds that the RO complied with the procedural steps set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) for both of the reductions. 

In general, the reduction of a rating must have been supported by the evidence on file at the time of the reduction.  Pertinent post-reduction evidence favorable to restoring the rating, however, also must be considered.  Dofflemeyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 279-280 (1992).  In addressing whether improvement is shown, the comparison point generally is the last examination on which the rating at issue was assigned or continued.  Hohol v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 169 (1992).

1. Rate Reduction: DDD of the Spine

The Veteran contends that the Regional Office (RO) improperly reduced her rating for service-connected DDD of the spine.

This matter stems from a July 2022 rating decision, which proposed to reduce the Veteran's evaluation for DDD of the spine from 40 percent to 10 percent following the results of a February 2022 VA examination, and subsequent April 2022 and July 2022 addendum opinions.  The Veteran disagreed with the reduction proposal and requested a hearing with the RO.  The Veteran did not attend the hearing.  As such, in a December 2023 rating decision, the RO reduced the Veteran's evaluation for DDD of the spine, effective March 1, 2024.  

At the time of the December 2023 reduction, the 40 percent evaluation for the Veteran's DDD of the spine had been in effect since April 14, 2020.  Thus, as the rating for her condition had been in effect for less than five years, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (a), (b), which govern the reduction of protected ratings in effect for five years or more, do not apply in this case.  Therefore, it must be determined that an improvement in the disability has actually occurred and that such improvement actually reflects an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413 (1993); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10, 4.13; 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (c) (authorizing reduction of a rating in effect for less than five years on the basis of examination disclosing improvement). 

The question of whether a disability has improved involves consideration of the applicable rating criteria.  Prior to the reduction, the Veteran's spine disability was rated under the criteria found at 38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5242, based on the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine.  Under the General Rating Formula, a 10 percent disability rating is provided for Forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, forward flexion of the cervical spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 40 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height.  A 20 percent disability rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis.  A 40 percent disability rating is assigned for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine to 30 degrees or less or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine.  38?C.F.R. §?4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5242.

The Veteran attended a VA examination in February 2022.  However, while an April 2022 addendum opinion noted the Veteran's forward flexion was to 90 degrees, the February 2022 VA examination and subsequent addendums were not adequate to properly determine the severity of the Veteran's condition.  As will be discussed below in the Remand portion of the herein decision, the February 2022 VA examination did not initially provide any range of motion information and did not provide it until April 2022, two months after the examination.  The examiner further did not address whether there was functional loss due to pain, weakness, excess fatigability, or incoordination, nor discuss any manifestation of functions to include, more or less movement than is normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, and pain on movement (as well as swelling or deformity), that affects stability, standing, and weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing as required under 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59.

In applying the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that the evidence of record was not adequate to clearly show that the Veteran's spine condition had improved under the ordinary conditions of life.  The examination did not meet the requirements of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, which also did not provide for proper consideration of DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).

Accordingly, the Board finds that the rating reduction from 40 percent to 10 percent was improper.  Therefore, the Veteran's 40 percent rating for DDD of the spine disability is restored, effective March 1, 2024.

2. Rate Reduction: Dyspepsia 

3. Rate Reduction: Migraine Headaches

The Veteran contends that the Regional Office (RO) improperly reduced her ratings for service-connected dyspepsia and migraine headaches.

This matter stems from a July 2022 rating decision, which proposed to reduce the Veteran's evaluation for dyspepsia from 60 percent to 10 percent following the results of two February 2022 and May 2022 VA examinations, and the evaluation for migraine headaches from 50 percent to 30 percent following a February 2022 VA examination.  The Veteran disagreed with the reduction proposal and requested a hearing with the RO.  The Veteran did not attend the hearing.  As such, in a December 2023 rating decision, the RO reduced the Veteran's evaluations for both her dyspepsia and migraine headaches, effective March 1, 2024.  

At the time of the December 2023 reductions, the 60 percent evaluation for the Veteran's dyspepsia and the 50 percent evaluation for her migraine headaches had been in effect since April 14, 2020.  Thus, as the ratings for her conditions had been in effect for less than five years, and the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (a), (b), which govern the reduction of protected ratings in effect for five years or more, do not apply in this case.  Thus, it must be determined that an improvement in the disability has actually occurred and that such improvement actually reflects an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413 (1993); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10, 4.13; 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (c) (authorizing reduction of a rating in effect for less than five years on the basis of examination disclosing improvement). 

The question of whether a disability has improved involves consideration of the applicable rating criteria.  For the Veteran's dyspepsia, prior to the reduction, her condition was rated under the criteria found at 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7309, 7346. DC 7309 advises to rate under 7304 for Gastric Ulcer.  Under 7304, a 10 percent is provided for mild ulcer with recurring symptoms once or twice a year.  A 20 percent is provided for moderate with recurring episodes of severe symptoms two or three times a year averaging 10 days in duration; or with continuous moderate manifestations; 40 percent when moderately severe or less than severe but with impairment of health manifested by anemia and weight loss; or recurrent incapacitating episodes averaging 10 days or more in duration at least four or more times a year.  A maximum 60 percent rating is assigned with ulcers that are severe, with pain only partially relieved by standard ulcer therapy, periodic vomiting, recurrent hematemesis or melena, with manifestations of anemia and weight loss productive of definite impairment of health.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7304, 7309.

Under DC 7346 for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a 10 percent rating is warranted when there are two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), pyrosis (heartburn), and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, causing considerable impairment of health.  A 60 percent rating is assigned for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7346.

Regarding the Veteran's migraine headaches, prior to the reduction, her condition was rated under DC 8100 for Migraines.  Under DC 8100, a 30 percent disability rating is assigned for headaches with characteristics of prostrating attacks occurring, on average, once a month.  A 50 percent disability rating is provided for very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124 (a), DC 8100.

After a review of the evidence, the Board finds that improvement of the Veteran's disabilities had been demonstrated, and improvement will be maintained under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  

First, in the February 2022 VA examination for stomach condition, the Veteran reported that she experienced sharp pains that were above umbilicus and got them about two times a month that lasted one hour maximum.  The Veteran's symptoms were recurring episodes of symptoms that were not severe that occurred 4 or more times a year and lasted less than 1 day.  She also had recurring severe symptoms that occurred 4 or more times a year that lasted less than 1 day.  Her abdominal pain occurred at least monthly and was periodic.  She had transient nausea that occurred 4 or more times a year and lasted less than 1 day.  There were no other significant symptoms.  In her May 2022 VA examination for stomach conditions and GERD, she reported a constant need to belch, and occasional regurgitation and reflux with burning.  The Veteran's symptoms were continuous abdominal pain, recurrent nausea that occurred 4 or more times a year and lasted less than one day.  The Veteran did have incapacitating episodes of abdominal pain and discomfort that occurred 4 or more times a year and lasted less than one day.  The Veteran's other symptoms were having persistently recurrent epigastric distress, dysphagia, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, substernal pain, and occasional sleep disturbance.  The Veteran did not have esophageal stricture, spasm of esophagus, or an acquired diverticulum of the esophagus. 

The Board reiterates that under DC 7304, a maximum 60 percent rating is assigned for ulcers that are severe, with pain only partially relieved by standard ulcer therapy, periodic vomiting, recurrent hematemesis or melena, with manifestations of anemia and weight loss productive of definite impairment of health.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7304, 7309.  Additionally, under 7346, a 60 percent rating is assigned for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7346.  In this regard, as discussed above, the Veteran's dyspepsia did not meet either of the diagnostic codes criteria for a 60 percent rating.  The Veteran's symptoms were not documented as being severe nor did the Veteran have severe ulcers, material weight loss, hematemesis or melena, or moderate anemia.

For the Veteran's migraine headaches, she attended a VA examination in February 2022.  The Veteran reported getting headaches, but they were not as bad due to her self-care.  She stated her headaches were a sharp pain on the top left of her head that sometimes traveled to the right side.  She reported meditation helps.  The Veteran's symptoms were pulsating or throbbing head pain that is localized to one side of the head, and sensitivity to light and sound.  Her headache pain lasted less than one day.  The Veteran experienced characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine and non-migraine headache pain once every month.  She did not have very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine/non migraine pain that is productive of severe economic inadaptability.  Under DC 8100, a 30 percent disability rating is assigned for headaches with characteristics of prostrating attacks occurring, on average, once a month, and the Veteran only met the criteria for a 30 percent evaluation at the time.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124 (a), DC 8100.  The Veteran further reported herself that her headaches were not as bad as they previously were. 

In light of the above, the Board finds that the persuasive evidence of record demonstrates actual improvement of the Veteran's dyspepsia and migraine headaches so as to warrant the rating reductions from 60 percent to 10 percent for dyspepsia, and 50 percent to 30 percent for migraine headaches, both effective from March 1, 2024.  Therefore, the reductions were proper, and restoration of the 60 percent rating for dyspepsia, and 50 percent rating for migraine headaches is not warranted.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e).

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The Board determines the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his/her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, and the assigned rating is based, as far as practicable, upon the average impairment of earning capacity in civil occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.10 (2018).  Where there is a question as to which of two ratings should be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Generally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings.  However, the evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is to be avoided.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

Additionally, when an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  In a claim for a greater original rating after an initial award of service connection, all of the evidence submitted in support of the veteran's claim is to be considered.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); 38 C.F.R. § 4.2.  However, consideration must be given as to whether staged ratings should be assigned to reflect entitlement to a higher rating at any point during the pendency of the claim.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

1. Entitlement to an Increased Rating: Dyspepsia

The Veteran's service-connected dyspepsia with abdominal pain is rated as 60 percent disabling prior to March 1, 2024, and as 10 percent disabling thereafter under Diagnostic Codes (DC) 7309-7346 of the Schedule Ratings for the Digestive System.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7309, 7346. 

Hyphenated DCs are used when a rating under one DC requires use of an additional DC to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional code is shown after the hyphen.  38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

Under DC 7346, a 10 percent rating is warranted when there are two or more of the symptoms for the 30 percent evaluation of less severity.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for persistently recurrent epigastric distress with dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), pyrosis (heartburn), and regurgitation, accompanied by substernal or arm or shoulder pain, causing considerable impairment of health.  A 60 percent rating is assigned for symptoms of pain, vomiting, material weight loss and hematemesis or melena with moderate anemia; or other symptom combinations productive of severe impairment of health.  Id.

The Board notes that the Schedule Ratings for the Digestive System, to include DC 7346, were amended, effective May 19, 2024.  See 89 Fed. Reg. 19735 (March 20, 2024).  However, since the current claim was pending as of the December 2023 rating decision, the amended criteria does not apply.  

In February 2022, the Veteran attended a VA examination.  The Veteran reported ongoing stomach issues.  She reported abdominal pain that is dull and sometimes sharp that is better with apple cider vinegar but worse with diary/milk or processed foods.  She also reported sometimes takes psyllium that works but she gets diarrhea.  She stated her sharp pains were above umbilicus and gets them about two times a month that last one hour maximum.  She stated that she drinks more water and moves her bowel which helps.  She reported she gets abdominal bloating as well.  The Veteran's symptoms were recurring episodes of symptoms that are not severe that occur 4 or more times a year and last less than 1 day.  She also has recurring severe symptoms that occur 4 or more times a year that last less than 1 day.  Her abdominal pain occurs at least monthly and is periodic.  She had transient nausea that occurs 4 or more times a year and lasts less than 1 day.  There were no other significant symptoms.  

The Veteran attended VA examinations in May 2022 for gastroesophageal diseases and stomach conditions.  She reported a constant need to belch, and occasional regurgitation and reflux with burning.  She reported medications have not helped and she has been to the emergency room a few times for pain.  She has been treated with liquids, mylanta, and Pepcid.  She stated she tried to avoid certain foods and has constant stomach pain.  The Veteran's symptoms were continuous abdominal pain, recurrent nausea that occurs 4 or more times a year and lasts less than one day.  The Veteran does have incapacitating episodes of abdominal pain and discomfort that occurs 4 or more times a year and last less than one day.  The Veteran's other symptoms were having persistently recurrent epigastric distress, dysphagia, pyrosis, reflux, regurgitation, substernal pain, occasional sleep disturbance.  The Veteran did not have esophageal stricture, spasm of esophagus, or an acquired diverticulum of the esophagus. 

VA treatment records document occasional complaints for stomach pain and epigastric symptoms such as acid reflux and nausea but no vomiting, to include in November 2023 and October 2023.  

After review of the evidence of record, the Board finds a rating of 30 percent, but no higher, from March 1, 2024, is warranted.  The Veteran's condition has been consistently noted as causing persistent epigastric distress, dysphagia, reflux, pyrosis, regurgitation, nausea, substernal pain, and continuous use of medications.  Therefore, the Board finds that the overall severity of her condition is more moderate and rises to the level to warrant a 30 percent rating.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7346.

However, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 30 percent is not warranted for this period.  The Veteran at no time has been diagnosed with material weight loss, hematemesis, or melena with moderate anemia nor has the Veteran reported such symptoms or conditions.  The Board recognizes that the Veteran reported pain; however, the evidence has not shown symptoms of material weight loss, anemia, pain in her shoulder or arm, nor has she reported any vomiting.  Lastly, her symptoms were not documented as causing severe impairment of her health.  Thus, the overall severity of her condition has not risen to the level to warrant a rating of 60 percent from March 1, 2024.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7346.

The Board notes that the Veteran has been provided a 30 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7346 for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), as it is the diagnostic code that provides the Veteran with the highest possible rating.  Consideration under DC 7309 for stomach stenosis, which advises to rate under DC 7304 for gastric ulcer, would only provide the Veteran with a 20 percent rating for moderate recurring episodes of severe symptoms.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, DC 7309.  A higher rating under DC 7309 would not be warranted because as previously discussed, the Veteran at no time has been documented as suffering from any kind of weight loss, anemia, periodic vomiting, hematemesis or melena, or incapacitating episodes that last 10 days or more, which would warrant a 40 or 60 percent rating under that diagnostic code.  Id.

Prior to March 1, 2024, the Veteran is provided a 60 percent rating, which is the maximum rating allowed under DC 7346 or DC 7309.  Further, the Veteran has not been diagnosed with stricture of the esophagus, spasm of the esophagus, loss of tongue, marginal ulcer, cirrhosis of the liver, colitis, fistula of the intestine, impairment of sphincter, postoperative ventral hernia, malignant or benign neoplasms of the digestive system, chronic liver disease, pancreatitis, or hepatitis A, which would warrant consideration of a higher rating under another Diagnostic Code under the Schedular Ratings for Digestive System.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.114, Diagnostic Codes 7200 through 7354.

Additionally, the Veteran's symptoms of recurring episodes of symptoms that are not severe that occur 4 or more times a year and last less than 1 day, recurring severe symptoms that occur 4 or more times a year that last less than 1 day, epigastric pain, acid reflux, and nausea are adequately considered and established under the schedular criteria.  Therefore, the Board finds that extraschedular consideration is not warranted for this period.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.321; See also Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111 (2008).  

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertions that she is entitled to a higher rating because her symptoms are worse.  The Board recognizes that lay persons are competent to report observations with regard to the severity of symptomatology.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  However, the Board has reviewed the evidence of record and finds it is consistent with the ratings assigned. 

In light of the foregoing, the Board concludes a rating of 30 percent, but no higher, for the Veteran's dyspepsia is warranted from March 1, 2024.  However, a rating in excess of 60 percent prior to March 1, 2024, is not warranted.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine has been applied.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

2. Entitlement to an Increased Rating: Migraine Headaches

The Veteran's headache condition is rated as 50 percent disabling prior to March 1, 2024, and as 30 percent disabling thereafter under Diagnostic Code (DC) 8100 for Migraines.  

Under Diagnostic Code 8100, a non-compensable rating is given for less frequent attacks.  A 10 percent rating for is assigned for headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in 2 months over the last several months.  A 30 percent disability rating is assigned for headaches with characteristics of prostrating attacks occurring, on average, once a month.  A 50 percent disability rating is provided for very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124 (a), DC 8100.

In March 2021, the Veteran attended a VA examination.  The Veteran reported not taking medicine and using tea and meditation.  She reported her current pain was on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst.  She reported pulsating or throbbing head pain that is localized to one side of the head and worsens with physical activity.  Her non-headache symptoms associated with her condition are sensitivity to light and sound, and sensory changes.  Her head pain usually last 1 to 2 days on the left side of her head.  She suffered from characteristic prostrating attacks once every month.  The Veteran did have very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraines/non-migraine pain productive of severe economic inadaptability.  

The Veteran attended another VA examination in February 2022.  The Veteran reported still getting headaches, but they were not as bad due to her self-care.  She stated her headaches were a sharp pain on the top left of her head that sometimes travel to the right side.  She stated meditation helps.  Her headaches occur 1 to 2 times a week and last about 30 to 45 minutes and were a 7 out of 10 in intensity.  She reported that noise and light bothers; however, she does not get nausea.  She does not take medication for her headaches.  The Veteran's symptoms were pulsating or throbbing head pain that is localized to one side of the head, and sensitivity to light and sound.  Her headache pain last less than one day.  The Veteran experiences characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine and non-migraine headache pain once every month.  She did not have very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine/non migraine pain that is productive of severe economic inadaptability.  The Veteran reported working from home and keeping all the lights off.  She states she cannot do activities with bright lights or physical activities during her headaches.  She reported she was studying business online.

The Board notes that VA treatment records show no visits pertaining to the Veteran's headache condition.  In fact, the Veteran often denied headaches during her visits for other conditions, to include during a December 2023 mental health visit, an August 2022 visit for pain, and February 2022 VA visit. 

Upon review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 30 percent from March 1, 2024, is warranted.  The Veteran's headache condition did not manifest to very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine/non migraine pain that is productive of severe economic inadaptability.   The Veteran's headaches at no time during this period were noted as being completely prostrating with prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  Further, the Veteran only reported moderate symptoms during this period, to include not taking any medication and controlling her symptoms with meditation and tea.  Her headaches were also not noted as severe and the Veteran herself reported improvement in her condition.  Additionally, the Veteran often reported no headaches during more recent VA visits.  Thus, a 50 percent rating from March 1, 2024, is not warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124 (a), DC 8100.

Prior to March 1, 2024, the Veteran's 50 percent rating is the maximum rating available under the schedular criteria, and therefore, a higher rating is not warranted.  As with the Veteran's dyspepsia condition, the Board has also considered whether extraschedular consideration is warranted.  However, the Veteran's symptoms of  pulsating or throbbing head pain that is localized to one side of the head, sensitivity to light and sound, characteristic prostrating attacks of migraine and non-migraine headache pain once a month, and very prostrating and prolonged attacks of migraine/non migraine pain that is productive of severe economic inadaptability are considered under the 50 percent rating for migraines with very frequent prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  Therefore, extraschedular consideration is not warranted for this period.  See 38 C.F.R. § § 3.321; See also Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111 (2008).  

Accordingly, the Board concludes that a rating in excess of 50 percent prior to March 1, 2024, and in excess of 30 percent thereafter for migraine headaches is not warranted.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.  See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  

REASONS FOR REMAND

Although the Board regrets further delay, additional development is required prior to adjudication of the Veteran's remaining claim. 

Entitlement to an Increased Rating: DDD of the Spine

The Veteran's claim is remanded to correct a duty assist error that occurred prior to the December 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  The Board finds the February 2022 VA examination and subsequent April 2022 and July 2022 addendum opinions are inadequate to fairly adjudicate the claim.  First, the February 2022 VA examination did not provide any range of motion information.  While an April 2022 VA addendum opinion provided the ranges of motion and where pain was present, the examiner did not address whether there was functional loss due to pain, weakness, excess fatigability, or incoordination, nor discuss any manifestation of functions to include, more or less movement than is normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, and pain on movement (as well as swelling or deformity), that affects stability, standing, and weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing as required under 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59.  See also DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32 (2011).  The Board notes that these factors were not discussed in the February 2022 VA examination nor the April 2022 and July 2022 addendum opinions. 

Given the above, the Board finds that a remand is required in order to obtain a new examination that adequately address the current severity of the Veteran's condition.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate examiner to determine the current severity of her lumbar condition.  The record and a copy of this Remand must be made available to the examiner.

Following a review of the entire record, to include the Veteran's lay statements regarding her current symptoms, the examiner should identify any findings related to the Veteran's degenerative disc disease of the spine and fully describe the current extent and severity of those symptoms.  

The examiner should discuss all findings in terms of the Schedule of Ratings for Musculoskeletal System, specifically the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, Diagnostic Code 5242.  The pertinent rating criteria must be provided to the examiner, and the findings reported must be sufficiently complete to allow for a rating under all alternate criteria.

The examiner should further determine whether any thoracolumbar disability is manifested by weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, flare-ups, or pain.  If feasible, the examiner must assess the additional functional impairment on repeated use or during flare-ups in terms of the degree of additional range of motion loss, using lay observations specifically elicited from the Veteran for each disability.  The examiner should also determine whether the Veteran's additional impairment on flare-ups or repetitive use is the functional equivalent of ankylosis of thoracolumbar or entire spine, as well as pain on weight bearing and on-weight bearing.   

In offering any opinion, the examiner must consider the full record, to include the lay statements regarding symptoms and the opinion should note that consideration.  A clearly stated rationale must be provided for any opinion offered.
