FINDING OF FACT

On June 28, 2024 and October 16, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

In the present case, the appellant has withdrawn this appeal. In correspondence received on June 28, 2024, the appellant stated, "...I recently submitted a new request for an appeal on June 11, 2024. I no longer desire to pursue these appeals and respectfully request that both be cancelled."  The appellant made a follow up request in correspondence received on October 16, 2024, stating in pertinent part, "I am requesting that those claims for appeal be discontinued. I no longer desire for those claims to move forward...Please disregard and cancel these claims for appeal as I no longer desire to pursue them."

Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
