ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence is approximately balanced as to whether the Veteran's erectile dysfunction is related to a service-connected disability. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the criteria for service connection for erectile dysfunction have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1986 to August 1990.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service. 38?U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131.  

Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show that a current disability exists and that the current disability results from the service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364, 1366 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (holding that section 1110 "requires compensation when a service-connected disease or injury is a but-for cause of a present-day disability" and noting that, apart from distinguishing whether service was during a period of war, 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110 and 1131 are identical).

After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is to be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38?U.S.C. §?5107;?38?C.F.R. §?3.102. If the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal, the claim is to be denied.  Lynch?v. McDonough,?999 F.3d 1391 (2021).

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction 

The Veteran is seeking service connection for his erectile dysfunction. Specifically, he asserts that he started having difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection after being diagnosed with his service-connected unspecified depressive disorder. See March 2023 VA Form 21-4138. 

The AOJ has favorably found that the Veteran has been diagnosed with erectile dysfunction. See December 2023 Rating Decision-Narrative. It has also favorably found that the claimed primary disability of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with unspecified depressive disorder is service connected. Id. The Board is bound by these findings and finds no clear and unmistakable error to rebut them. Thus, the remaining question is whether the Veteran's erectile dysfunction is related to his service-connected PTSD with unspecified depressive disorder. The Board finds that it is.

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran has submitted a private positive nexus opinion for secondary service connection for his erectile dysfunction. The September 2023 private medical opinion from Registered Nurse (RN) D.P. explains that "[e]ven though [erectile dysfunction] may be multifactorial, it is recognized to be at least aggravated by this [V]eteran's service connected mental health condition as he has stated, and the medical literature has substantiated that mental health conditions themselves [...] directly cause and/or at least aggravate to varying degrees, erectile dysfunction." D.P. concluded that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction is at least as likely as not (a 50%/50% probability) "secondary to, related to, and/or aggravated by his service-related condition to include unspecified depressive disorder." See September 2023 Medical Treatment Record-Non-Government Facility.

The Board finds the opinion of D.P. to be of significant probative value. In particular, he explicitly considered the Veteran's specific contention, the claims file, including the Veteran's service treatment records and VA treatment records, medical research, and clinical medical evidence, before providing a positive opinion. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (the probative value of a medical opinion is derived from a factually accurate, fully articulated, and soundly reasoned opinion). 

In November 2023, a VA clinician opined that the veteran's erectile dysfunction was less likely than not related to his service-connected psychiatric disorder. In support of that conclusion, the clinician stated the two conditions were not medically related, that erectile dysfunction is a separate entity entirely, and that review of medical literature failed to demonstrate a causal relationship. The clinician provided no further rationale, did not identify the medical literature he referenced, and did not discuss the September 2023 private opinion.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary is required to give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107. Here, the private opinion of D.P. brings the evidence addressing whether the Veteran's erectile dysfunction is secondary to his service-connected PTSD with unspecified depressive disorder at least into approximate balance. Therefore, resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that his erectile dysfunction is the result of his service-connected PTSD with unspecified depressive disorder, and the claim is granted. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.
