ORDER

Service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, other than depression, anxiety, and insomnia disorders, to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's psychiatric condition, other than depression, anxiety, and insomnia disorders, to include PTSD is related to service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for psychiatric disorder, other than depression, anxiety, and insomnia disorders, to include PTSD have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 2014 to May 2015.

In June 2022, the regional office (RO) denied service connection for a psychiatric condition, including depression and PTSD.  In March 2023, the Veteran filed a higher-level review for the appealed conditions and in June 2023 the RO identified a duty to assist error for the appealed condition.  In November 2023, the RO granted service connection for major depression disorder, anxious distress, and insomnia disorder with a 70 percent evaluation from January 2022 and denied the claim for PTSD. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected a Direct Review.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2022 and November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal was not considered.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider with respect to the appealed claim, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

In general, service connection may be granted for a disability or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  To prevail on a direct service connection claim, there must be competent evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a nexus between the in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Service connection may also be established by credible lay evidence and medical evidence provided by the Veteran or otherwise.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131 (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (2018).

Service connection for PTSD specifically requires: (1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; (2) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor actually occurred; and (3) medical evidence of a link between current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304.

Determinations as to service connection will be based on review of the entire evidence of record, to include all pertinent medical and lay evidence, with due consideration to VA's policy to administer the law under a broad and liberal interpretation consistent with the facts in each individual case.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). 

Service connection for acquired psychiatric disorder, other than depression, anxiety, and insomnia disorders, to include PTSD.

The Veteran seeks service connection for a psychiatric condition, other than depression, anxiety, and insomnia disorders, to include PTSD.  In support, the Veteran reported suffering several stressors in service, including finding a fellow service member after a suicide attempt.  See VA form 21-0781a (October 2020).

The medical evidence documents functional impairment with treatment and a diagnosis of PTSD by a VA doctor.  See VA medical treatment record (May 2022 and October 2023).  

A negative nexus opinion was obtained by VA for a psychiatric condition in July 2023.  See VA medical examination (July 2023).  However, the examiner did not sufficiently address the pertinent lay and medical evidence of record regarding the cause and nature of the Veteran's PTSD.  See Miller v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 249, 260 (2020).  Additionally, the examiner did not apply the correct standard of proof or support the findings with a full rationale.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (probative value of a medical opinion is derived from it being factually accurate, fully articulated, and soundly reasoned).  Further, the examiner did not consider or discuss the competent medical evidence demonstrating a diagnosis of PTSD with treatment, including at VA facilities.  Consequently, the VA opinion as to PTSD is inadequate and afforded minimal probative value.  

Although the evidence does not include an adequate medical examination and opinion assessing the Veteran's PTSD claim, the evidence is sufficient to decide the appeal.  Moreover, while the Board could remand for an adequate examination and opinion, the Board finds that it would cause undue delay and could lead to a prohibited remand for negative evidence.  See Mariano v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 305, 312 (2003).  

In assessing whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

Here, the medical evidence reveals VA's treatment of the Veteran's PTSD, associates the disorder with the Veterans stressors experienced in service.  See VA medical treatment record (May 2022 and October 2023).  While the medical evidence does not explicitly identify a nexus, the medical treatment notes implicitly relate the Veteran's current PTSD symptoms to the claimed in-service stressors. Also, the Veteran credibly reported persistent psychiatric problems due to the stressors suffered since service.  The Veteran, as a lay person, is "competent to report observable conditions."  The Veteran's competent lay statements are credible.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994).  Consequently, the lay and medical evidence constitute highly probative evidence weighing in favor of the claim and establishes a link between the Veteran's current symptomatology and the claimed in-service stressor.  

For the above reasons, the probative evidence weighs in favor of the Veteran's claim and establishes a relationship with service.  Therefore, service connection for PTSD is warranted.

While the Veteran has claims for, and has been diagnosed with, several psychiatric disorders, these disorders are part of the service connection claim for an acquired psychiatric disorder.  In Velez v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 199, 204 (2009), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that "treating each psychiatric diagnosis as a separate claim "would force a veteran to continually file new claims as medical evidence is developed during the initial claim."  Therefore, the Board's decision represents a total grant of the benefits sought in this appeal.
