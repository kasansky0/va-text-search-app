ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to March 14, 2023 for the award of a 10 percent evaluation for hypertension is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's hypertension is not manifested by diastolic pressure 100 or more or systolic pressure predominately 160 or more, or a history of diastolic pressure 100 or more that requires continuous medication for control prior to March 14, 2023. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to March 14, 2023 for the award of a 10 percent evaluation for hypertension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400, 4.1-4.14, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1969 through January 1971, to include Vietnam Era service. 

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision. 

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review (HLR) and requested review of a July 2023 rating decision. In December 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2023 decision. 

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the July 2023 decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision addressing the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Law and Analysis

The law regarding effective dates states that, unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final adjudication, or a claim for increase, of compensation, dependency and indemnity compensation, or pension, shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). This statutory provision is implemented by a VA regulation, which provides that the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, or a claim reopened after final disallowance, will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

A "claim" for VA compensation purposes means a "written or electronic communication requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a specific benefit under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs submitted on an application form prescribed by the Secretary." 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). Prior to 2015, any communication indicating intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by VA may be considered an informal claim provided it identifies, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought. See Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-5 (1998). A claimant may preserve an earlier effective date by indicating their desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an Intent to File a claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). Generally, if a formal application for benefits is received within a year of an Intent to File a claim, the date of claim for effective date purposes is the date the Intent to File was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(d)(1)(ii). 

The date of entitlement for service connection is the date the claimant meets the basic eligibility criteria including evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

When there is a prior final decision in the claims file and a later claim results in a grant of the benefit, the general rule for effective dates for reopened claims applies. In such cases the effective date cannot be earlier than the subsequent claim to reopen. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110(a), (i), 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q), (r); Sears v. Principi, 349 F.3d 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The award can be made effective no earlier than the date of the new application. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110(a), (i), 5108; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(c), 3.400(q), (r). 

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The rating schedule is primarily a guide in the evaluation of disability resulting from all types of diseases and injuries encountered as a result of, or incident to, military service. The ratings are intended to compensate, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and their residual conditions in civilian occupations. 38 U.S.C. §1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

In considering the severity of a disability, it is essential to trace the medical history of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.41. Consideration of the whole-recorded history is necessary so that a rating may accurately reflect the elements of disability present. 38 C.F.R. § 4.2; Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282 (1991). While the regulations require review of the recorded history of a disability by the adjudicator to ensure a more accurate evaluation, the regulations do not give past medical reports precedence over the current medical findings. 

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). However, where the question for consideration is the propriety of the initial rating assigned, evaluation of the evidence since the effective date of the grant of service connection is required. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999). Where VA's adjudication of the claim for increase is lengthy and factual findings show distinct time periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms which would warrant different ratings, different or "staged" ratings may be assigned for such different periods of time. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007); Fenderson, 12 Vet. App. at 126-27. 

Except as otherwise provided by law, a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for benefits. VA shall consider all information and lay and medical evidence of record in a case and when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (benefit-of-the-doubt rule not for application when evidence persuasively favors one side or the other).

Earlier Effective Date

The Veteran is currently assigned a noncompensable evaluation for hypertension from August 10, 2022 and a 10 percent evaluation for hypertension from March 14, 2023, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

Under Diagnostic Code 7101, an evaluation of 10 percent is warranted for diastolic pressure predominately 100 or more; systolic pressure predominately 160 or more; or, as the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominately 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control. An evaluation of 20 percent is assigned for diastolic pressure predominately 110 or more; or systolic pressure predominately 200 or more. An evaluation of 40 percent is contemplated for diastolic pressure predominately 120 or more. An evaluation of 60 percent is warranted for diastolic pressure predominately 130 or more.

For VA compensation purposes, the term hypertension means that diastolic blood pressure is predominately 90 or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means that systolic blood pressure is predominately 160 or greater with diastolic blood pressure less than 90. Hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on at least three different days. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101, Note (1).

Under Diagnostic Code 7101, "a history of diastolic pressure predominately 100 or more [that] requires continuous medication for control" refers to blood pressure readings taken before a Veteran began medication to control hypertension, and therefore may require analyzing blood pressure readings prior to the period on appeal. Wilson v. McDonough, 35 Vet. App. 75 (2021).

The Veteran contends he is entitled to a 10 percent evaluation from August 10, 2022, which is the effective date for his grant of service connection for hypertension. See December 2024 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement). 

By way of history, the Veteran filed an April 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation) for hypertension. The claim was denied in an October 2021 rating decision. The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim in October 2022. The Veteran then filed a March 14, 2023 Intent to File. An April 2023 rating decision granted the Veteran's claim for service connection for hypertension with a noncompensable evaluation effective August 10, 2022. The Veteran filed a May 2023 VA Form 20-0995 Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim seeking an increased rating for hypertension. In a July 2023 rating decision, the Veteran's hypertension was increased to 10 percent effective March 14, 2023. The Veteran filed an August 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review (HLR) requesting an earlier effective date for the 10 percent evaluation for hypertension. A December 2023 rating decision denied the claim. The Veteran then filed a December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement). 

Upon review, the Board finds the Veteran is not entitled to an effective date prior to March 14, 2023 for the award of a ten percent evaluation for hypertension. 

The Veteran underwent a VA medical examination in November 2022, which noted the Veteran's diagnosis of hypertension and his statement regarding his nocturnal hypertension with a systolic blood pressure in excess of 150mm mercury at night. The examiner noted the Veteran did not tolerate blood pressure medications well, which made it difficult to treat his hypertension with medication. The Veteran did not report continuous use of medications for hypertension. At the time of examination, the Veteran's blood pressure readings were 118/80, 118/70, and 134/88. The Veteran's hypertension was not shown to impact his ability to work. See November 2022 Hypertension Disability Benefits Questionnaire. 

The Veteran's medical records from August 2022 through March 2023 contain the following blood pressure readings: 138/90 in September 2022; 124/70 in October 2022, and 124/82 and 138/78 in March 2023. A Central Ohio Primary Care treatment record from March 2023 contains the Veteran's statement that he went to a dental appointment in February 2023 and his systolic pressure was in the 160s. The physician reported the Veteran brought his blood pressure log in from home and that the results were mostly normal averaging in the 130s. The physician also noted the Veteran's further statement that he was stressed while at the dental office because he was told he would need a procedure. See August 2022 through March 2023 Central Ohio Primary Care Records. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence does not persuasively show that the Veteran's diastolic pressure has been predominately 100 or more or that his systolic pressure has been predominately 160 or more for the period on appeal. The Board does acknowledge that the Veteran reported his systolic pressure was in the 160s while at a dental appointment in February 2023, however, the remainder of the Veteran's medical records for the period on appeal do not document his systolic pressure being over 160 on numerous occasions both prior to and after that date. Notably, in a subsequent March 2023 Ohio Primary Care record, the Veteran's blood pressure reading was 124/82. Thus, such evidence does not show that the Veteran's diastolic pressure was predominately over 100, nor does the evidence show that his systolic pressure was predominately over 160. 

Here the Veteran does not report taking medication to treat his hypertension during the relevant period on appeal. Even if he did utilize medication however, the rating criteria for hypertension specifically contemplate the use of medication to ameliorate symptoms and that a higher rating may not be assigned solely based on the fact that the Veteran uses medication to treat his symptoms. Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012) ("absent a clear statement [in the Diagnostic Code] setting out whether or how the Board should address the effects of medication, the Board may not deny entitlement to a higher disability rating on the basis of relief provided by medication."). Indeed, in McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267 (2016), the Court specifically held that the Board did not err in failing to discount the ameliorative effects of blood pressure medication, as the plain language of Diagnostic Code 7101 contemplates the effects of medications. 

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran has not been shown to meet the criteria for a compensable evaluation for hypertension prior to March 14, 2023. Therefore, the Board concludes that an earlier effective date for the award of a 10 percent evaluation for hypertension is not warranted and the claim is denied.

The Veteran and his representative have not raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 368 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).
