ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's sleep apnea began during active service or is otherwise related to an in service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's sleep apnea have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service in the United States Air Force from June 2001 to November 2005.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea. 

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  To establish service connection for the claimed disorder, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; see also Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The Veteran is seeking service connection for her sleep apnea due to her exposure to environmental hazards during active service.  

She was diagnosed with sleep apnea via a July 2023 VA sleep study.  

The Veteran's service treatment records are silent for complaints and treatment associated with sleep apnea.  However, VA has conceded the Veteran's participation in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) due to her service in Saudia Arabia.  A January 2023 VA memorandum indicates that the Veteran serviced in Saudia Arabia from July 2002 to August 2002.

Therefore, the remaining issue for consideration by the Board is whether the Veterans' sleep apnea was caused by her conceded TERA.

In August 2023, a VA examiner considered whether the Veteran's TERA caused her sleep apnea, including the exposure to burn pits and pollutants.  The examined noted that a review of the medical literature find that certain environmental exposures may cause sleep apnea.  Specifically, the medical literature did not support a finding that exposure to burn pits or particulate matter significantly increases the risk of developing sleep apnea.  Consequently, the examiner concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine that the Veteran's sleep apnea was caused by his TERA participation, including his exposure to burn pits and airborne hazards.  She concluded that the more likely cause of the Veteran's sleep apnea was her obesity.

There are no positive medical opinions of record.  The probative evidence of record indicates that the Veteran was diagnosed with sleep apnea more than 15 years following her separation from active service.

The Board has considered the medical and lay evidence of record in determining whether service connection is warranted.  The negative August 2023 VA opinion provided competent, credible evidence against the Veteran's claim.  The examiner consulted medical literature and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to find a nexus for the Veteran's sleep apnea.  Accordingly, her negative opinion is afforded high probative weight.  Though the Veteran's lay opinion was considered, the evidence fails to show that she has the requisite medical training and knowledge to provide a competent opinion that her sleep apnea was caused by her in service environmental exposure.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376 77 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).  Determining the etiology of the Veteran's sleep apnea requires medical inquiry into biological processes, pathology, anatomical relationships, and physiological functioning.  Such internal physical processes are not readily observable and are not within the competence of the Veteran in this case.  As a result, the probative value of her lay assertions is low.

?

Therefore, the Board finds that the balance of probative evidence is against the Veteran's claim and service connection for her sleep apnea is not warranted.
