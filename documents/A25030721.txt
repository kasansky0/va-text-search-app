ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea as secondary to service-connected musculoskeletal conditions is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On January 23, 2025, prior to promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran, through his authorized representative, withdrew the claim of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea as secondary to service-connected musculoskeletal conditions.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of the claim of entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea as secondary to service-connected musculoskeletal conditions have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from November 1977 to June 1997, with additional service in the Army Reserve.

The matter is on appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a February 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). Thus, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

On January 23, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran, through his authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. 

A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal. 38 C.F.R.  

§ 20.205(b)(1).

Here, the Veteran's appointed representative filed a "Motion to Withdraw Appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals" on January 23, 2025, which included the Veteran's name, the VA file number, and the following statement: "Under the direction of my client . . . I write to withdraw their VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) dated 02/24/2024" for the claim of entitlement to secondary service connection for sleep apnea. See January 2025 Motion to Withdraw Appeal; see also September 2024 VA 21-22.

Thus, the issue on appeal has been validly withdrawn and there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
