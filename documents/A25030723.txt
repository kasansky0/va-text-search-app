ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On August 23, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received written notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of the Veteran's appeal in the matter of service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome was requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal seeking service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2003 to November 2003 and from January 2004 to August 2004.  The Veteran had additional service in the National Guard.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2024, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In a July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

The Veteran submitted an August 2024 request to withdraw his appeal.

Service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific errors of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In Hembree v. Wilkie, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that written withdrawals of an appeal are governed by the application of regulations instead of DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011) (requiring a withdrawal to be explicit, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences).  33 Vet. App. 1, 7 (2020).

As this case is governed by the AMA, the applicable regulation is 38 C.F.R. § 20.205, which requires that the withdrawal includes the name of the appellant and the file number.  Additionally, the Veteran or representative must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issues withdrawn from the appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1).  Under 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(c), withdrawal of an appeal will be deemed a withdrawal of the Notice of Disagreement as to all issues to which the withdrawal applies.

The Veteran submitted a written August 2024 request to withdraw his appeal, stating that he was requesting to withdraw all contentions under docket "D2407174551."  The request included the name of the Veteran and the Veteran's social security number.  Additionally, although the listed docket number did not include the final digit, the request provided sufficient details to identify that the entirety of the appeal was being withdrawn.  

Thereafter, on August 26, 2024, the Veteran's Representative submitted a motion requesting the Veteran's appeal under docket D 240717-455518 be withdrawn/dismissed.  The request included the name of the Veteran, the claim number, the docket number, and provided sufficient details to identify that the entirety of the appeal was being withdrawn.

The Board therefore finds that the Veteran's withdrawal was valid and effective upon its receipt by the Board.  

The Veteran has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration in regard to service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the issue of service connection for chronic fatigue syndrome and the appeal is dismissed.
