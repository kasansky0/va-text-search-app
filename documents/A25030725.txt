ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a July 2024 rating decision, the Veteran was awarded service connection for erectile dysfunction.  This constitutes a full grant of benefits sought on appeal.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 2004 to August 2004, from May 2006 to January 2008, from February 2014 to September 2014, and from October 2014 to October 2016.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in June 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

During the pendency of the appeal, the AOJ granted the Veteran's claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction in a July 2024 rating decision and assigned an effective date of January 6, 2024.

1. Entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction is dismissed as moot.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 19.55.  As a general matter, the grant of a claim of service connection constitutes an award of full benefits sought on an appeal of the denial of a service connection claim.  Seri v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 441, 447 (2007); see also Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (where an appealed claim for service connection is granted during the pendency of the appeal, a second Notice of Disagreement must thereafter be timely filed to initiate appellate review of "downstream" issues such as the compensation level assigned for the disability or the effective date of service connection).

In this case, the Veteran's appeal stemmed from a May 2024 claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction, which was filed within one year of a January 6, 2024 Intent to File.  He was awarded service connection for erectile dysfunction in a July 2024 rating decision by the AOJ and assigned an effective date of January 6, 2024.  The avenue to pursue that issue was by appealing or requesting review of the July 2024 AOJ rating decision that assigned the effective date and rating.

Any contest to either effective date or rating is considered a "downstream" issue not included in a service connection analysis.  See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Holland v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 433 (1997) (holding that service connection, rating issues and effective date issues are separate, and that effective date issues are downstream in relation to the other issues).  Therefore, as service connection has already been granted and there is a clearly established procedural framework for appealing decisions and for initiating Board review of timely appealed rating decisions, the Board must find there is no current case or controversy in dispute regarding the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction.  Id.  The claim is dismissed.
