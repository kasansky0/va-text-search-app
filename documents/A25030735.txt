ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for left upper extremity ulnar nerve radiculopathy is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's left upper extremity ulnar nerve radiculopathy began in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for left upper extremity ulnar nerve radiculopathy have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107 (2024); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably in the U.S. Air Force from January 2004 to January 2024.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 rating decision by the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to service connection for left upper extremity ulnar nerve radiculopathy

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303.? The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.? Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).? 

When, after careful consideration of all the evidence, there is a reasonable doubt regarding service connection, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the veteran.? 38?U.S.C. §?5107(b); 38?C.F.R. §?3.102.? The phrase "reasonable doubt" means there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence which does not satisfactorily prove or disprove the claim.? Id.? The evidence is not in approximate balance when the evidence "persuasively favors one side or the other."? Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021).?

The Board finds that service connection is warranted in this case.  First, the Veteran has a current disability in the form of a diagnosis of left upper extremity ulnar nerve radiculopathy.  See March 2024 VA Examination.  Next, in the June 2024 rating decision, the AOJ made the favorable finding that there is evidence of a qualifying event, injury, or disease that had its onset during the Veteran's service in that the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) show that the Veteran was seen for his left wrist and hand while in service.  Under the Appeals Modernization Act, the Board is bound by the favorable findings of the AOJ in the absence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104.  The Board finds no clear and unmistakable error in this instance.  

Finally, the evidence shows that a causal relationship exists between the Veteran's current disability of left upper extremity ulnar nerve radiculopathy and his in-service treatment of his left hand and wrist.  At the outset and significantly, the March 2024 VA examiner noted a diagnosis of left upper extremity ulnar nerve radiculopathy with an inception date of 2009 while the Veteran was on active duty.  Moreover, it was explained that the symptoms leading to the diagnosis started while the Veteran was in service.  The Board finds the examination to be adequate.  It is based on an accurate factual premise and an examination of the Veteran.  Indeed, the Veteran has consistently described symptoms of numbness, tingling and pain in his left arm, elbow, wrist, and hand while in service and these same symptoms have continued since service.  The Veteran first noticed that his left pinky finger and left ring finger would tingle after he bent his left elbow for an extended period before his deployment in 2009.  See March 2024 VA Examination.  The Veteran's STRs confirm that the Veteran reported that his fingers had been tingling for 3-4 weeks in March 2009 and the Veteran was scheduled for an ulnar nerve conduction study when he returned from deployment.  However, there is no evidence in the STRs that this follow-up appointment took place.  In October 2011, the Veteran was seen for left arm pain that had been occurring for the previous 2 years.  At this treatment visit, the Veteran reported that he experienced pain, tingling, and numbness in his left elbow and wrist at times and that his left hand grip was weak.  During the Veteran's July 2023 separation exam, he reported experiencing "numbness or tingling" since 2010 on the ulnar side of his left arm which began at the elbow and ended at his left ring and pinky fingers.  The Veteran also reported experiencing occasional pain when pressure was applied to the palm of his left hand.  Finally, during the March 2024 VA examination, the Veteran described his current symptoms as "constant numbness in his left pinky and ring fingers" and having a weak grip with his left hand.  He also reported that massaging the "channel in the elbow where the ulnar nerve is" makes the pain better and that "when [his] elbow is bent for longer than 15 minutes," he feels pain in his left pinky and ring fingers.  Therefore, as noted, the Board finds the examination, to include the diagnosis rendered, to be adequate and accords it great probative weight.

The Board acknowledges the negative nexus opinions provided by VA examiners in March 2024 and May 2024.  However, the March 2024 opinion only addresses whether the Veteran's left hand condition was caused by the Veteran's toxic exposure risk activities while in service and thus, is not relevant to the Veteran's claim.  The May 2024 addendum opinion is inadequate to the extent that it attempts to nullify the diagnosis of left upper extremity ulnar nerve radiculopathy provided in the March 2024 VA examination.  While the May 2024 opinion clarifies that the Veteran does not have a musculoskeletal diagnosis and attempts to nullify the diagnosis of left upper extremity ulnar nerve radiculopathy it does so without any consideration of the Veteran's competent reports of constant pain, tingling, and numbness in his left upper extremity.  See Layno, 6 Vet. App. at 470.  Accordingly, the Board affords the March 2024 and May 2024 opinions no probative weight.

Therefore, based on the competent and probative evidence of record, the Board finds the Veteran has a current diagnosis of left upper extremity ulnar nerve radiculopathy, this condition began in service and has continued to the present day.  Accordingly, service connection is warranted.
