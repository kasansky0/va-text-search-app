ORDER

Service connection for post-micturition dribbling is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The evidence shows a current diagnosis of post-micturition dribbling.

2.  The facts of this case show that post-micturition dribbling is a congenital defect.

3. There was no disease or injury superimposed on the post-micturition dribbling during service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for post-micturition dribbling have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1153; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(c), 3.304, 3.306, 4.9.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, who is the appellant in this case, served on active duty from June 1966 to June 1969.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran timely appealed this decision to the Board by requesting the Direct Review docket; therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the January 2024 AOJ decision cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection Legal Authority

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  As a general matter, service connection for a disability requires evidence of: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) the existence of the disease or injury in service, and; (3) a relationship or nexus between the current disability and any injury or disease during service.

In cases where the appellant seeks service connection for a congenital condition, the Board must indicate whether the condition is a disease or defect and discuss the presumption of soundness.  Quirin v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 390, 394-97 (2009).  The presumption of soundness does not apply to congenital defects because such defects "are not diseases or injuries" within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110 and 1111.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(c); see also Quirin, 22 Vet. App. at 390 (holding that the presumption of soundness does not apply to congenital defects); Winn v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 510, 516 (1996) (holding that a non-disease or non-injury entity such as a congenital defect is "not the type of disease- or injury-related defect to which the presumption of soundness can apply").

For purposes of determining whether a disorder is a congenital defect or a familiar disease, VA interprets the term "disease" in 38 U.S.C. §§ 310, 331, and the term "defects" in 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(c), as being mutually exclusive.  "Disease" is broadly defined as any deviation from or interruption of the normal structure or function of any part, organ, or system of the body that is manifested by a characteristic set of symptoms and signs and whose etiology, pathology, and prognosis may be known or unknown.  See VAOPGCPREC 82-90 (citing 385 Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary (26th ed. 1974)).  On the other hand, the term "defect," viewed in the context of 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(c), is defined as a structural or inherent abnormality or conditions that are more or less stationary in nature.  As noted in VAOPGCPREC 82-90, a Federal court, in drawing a distinction between "disease" and "defect," indicated that disease referred to a condition considered capable of improving or deteriorating, whereas defect referred to a condition not considered capable of improving or deteriorating.  See Durham v. United States, 214 F.2d 862, 875 (D.C. Cir. 1954); see also United States v. Shorter, 343 A.2d 569, 572 (D.C. 1975).

Service connection is generally precluded by regulation for "defects" because they are not "diseases" or "injuries" within the meaning of applicable legislation.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(c), 4.9, 4.127; Terry v. Principi, 340 F.3d 1378, 1383-84 (Fed. Cir. 2003); Palczewski v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 174, 179 (2007).  To establish service connection for a congenital defect, the evidence must show superimposed disease or injury during service.  VAOPGCPREC 82-90.  

When there is an approximate balance of evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the Board gives the veteran the benefit of the doubt in resolving the issue.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021) (en banc).

Service Connection for Post-Micturition Dribbling is Denied.

The Veteran appeals for service connection for post-micturition dribbling.  See September 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.  The Veteran stated that the condition started when he was a child, but contends that it was worsened by military service.  See September 2023 VA Examination.  

The Veteran's post-micturition, which he has had since he was a child, is a congenital defect for which service connection cannot be granted.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(c), 4.9.  The etiology of the Veteran's condition is unknown; however, because it was present when he was a child, well prior to service, and prior to any other potential risk factors for such disorder, the defect causing post-micturition dribbling was congenital.  See September 2023 VA Examination.  The presumption of soundness at service entrance does not apply to congenital defects.  Service connection can only be granted for this preexisting congenital defect if there is a superimposed injury, and if the superimposed injury aggravates (causes worsening in severity of) the preexisting post-micturition during service.  See VAOPGCPREC 82-90, 55 Fed. Reg. 45711 (1990).  

The persuasive weight of the lay and medical evidence in this case shows no superimposed injury to the post-micturition dribbling during service (June 1966 to June 1969), and no indication of worsening during service.  During service in September 1968, there is a notation regarding urethral discharge, but it was related to a sexually transmitted disease.  The only disease noted appears to be the sexually transmitted gonorrhea, which was treated with penicillin during service.  The evidence does not show that the gonorrhea had any effect on the post-micturition dribbling during service.  In another undated service treatment record, Report of Medical History, the Veteran again reported no frequent or painful urination.  See Service Treatment Records, Received January 2023 at 37.  In the April 1969 service separation examination, there appears to be a note reflecting that the Veteran was treated for something related to urine, but no further details are provided, and the Veteran was deemed qualified for separation from service.    

More current VA treatment records show a positive urinary incontinence screen in April and May 2023, and the September 2023 VA examiner noted the history of erectile dysfunction in 2023.  The current VA treatment records also do not reflect any history of a superimposed injury or aggravation of post-micturition dribbling during service.   VA treatment records show that in January 2023 the Veteran reported no problems with bowel movements or urine.  Prior to that, in both September 2021 and March 2022, the Veteran denied urinary frequency or urgency.  

At a VA examination in September 2023 for post-micturition dribbling, the Veteran reported that the dribbling began prior to service as a child, but that it increased during service and now requires the use of absorbent material.  The examiner determined that the Veteran has a voiding dysfunction that causes urine leakage.  The examiner noted that the Veteran requested that there be no physical examination of the penis or testes.  The examiner further assessed that there were no other pertinent findings, complications, conditions, signs, symptoms or scars, and no other significant diagnostic test findings or results related to the claimed condition or diagnosis that was reviewed in conjunction with the examination.  

The Board finds the Veteran's lay statement that symptoms increased and/or worsened during service is inconsistent with, and outweighed by, other more contemporaneous lay and medical evidence, so is not credible.  The service treatment records did not show worsening of dribbling.  In fact, during service on two occasions the Veteran denied urinary symptoms.  The Veteran's post-service lay statement regarding in-service symptoms, which was made very recently pursuant to this claim for compensation, contradicts the more credible, competent, and contemporaneous lay and medical evidence during service.  Consistent with a finding of lack of worsening of symptoms during service, even the more recent VA treatment records include no history by the Veteran of the dribbling condition during service or worsening of the condition during service, even though urinary symptoms were discussed and identified as part of the examination history and findings.  As a result, the Veteran's recent non-credible assertion of worsening symptoms during service lacks probative value.           

As a result of the September 2023 VA examination, the examiner opined that, while current treatment records support chronicity, there is no evidence in the service treatment records to support increased symptoms during service dates, and opined that it is less likely than not that the current symptoms were caused by an in-service injury, event, illness, or the sexually transmitted disease in service.  The Board finds the VA medical opinion probative as it is based on an in-person examination, an accurate medical history, the relevant facts pertinent to service, and the examiner considered the lay and medical evidence of record.  The service treatment records support the VA examiner's conclusion that the gonorrhea in service did not aggravate the dribbling condition as the records regarding gonorrhea make no mention of the Veteran's post-micturition dribbling, but only that the sexually transmitted disease was treated.  The evidence of record simply does not show symptoms of post-micturition dribbling during service.                  

For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the persuasive weight of the lay and medical evidence of record is against finding of superimposed injury or aggravation of the congenital defect during service; therefore, the appeal must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306
