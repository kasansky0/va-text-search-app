ORDER

A compensable rating for tinea pedis of the bilateral feet is denied.

A compensable rating for allergic rhinitis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's tinea pedis of both feet has not been shown to have affected at least 5 percent of the entire body or exposed areas, nor has treatment of the condition required intermittent systemic therapy such as with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs.

2. The Veteran's rhinitis has not been shown to result in more than 50 percent obstruction of either nasal passage, or polyps.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. A compensable rating for tinea pedis of both feet is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7813.

2. The criteria for a compensable rating for allergic rhinitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 1997 to August 2005.

These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2023 rating decision. The Veteran requested a higher level review (HLR) of this decision. The HLR decision denied the claims in April 2024, and the Veteran timely appealed this rating decision to the Board, requesting the Direct Review Docket. This means that the Board, in adjudicating this appeal, may only review the evidence that was of record at the time of the August 2023 rating decision. To the extent evidence was received after that time, the Board may not consider it unless a supplemental claim is received that either identifies or resubmits the evidence.

i) A compensable rating for bilateral foot tinea pedis is denied.

The Veteran is currently rated at zero percent for his tinea pedis of both feet under Diagnostic Code (DC) 7813. 

On February 5, 2023, VA received a formal claim for an increased rating for his skin disability. See VA Form 21-526 EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation), received on February 5, 2023. 

DC 7813 (evaluation of dermatophytosis) will be rated under a General Rating Formula, which provides that, a noncompensable rating is assigned for a skin condition for which no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period and at least one of the following (1) characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected; or (2) characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected. Or rate as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (DC 7800) or scars (7801, 7802, 7804, or 7805), depending upon the predominant disability. This rating instruction does not apply to DC 7824.

As DC 7800,7801, 7802, 7804 and 7805 evaluate scars, and the evidence does not show that the Veteran's tine pedis and onychomycosis caused any scaring, these diagnostic codes do not apply.

A 10 percent rating will be assign if the disability meets one of the following (i) characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or (ii) at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or (iii) intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period. A 30 percent and a 60 percent rating will be assigned if characteristic lesions cover more percentage of the entire body or exposed area with more advanced treatment. General Rating Formula For The Skin For DCs 7806, 7809, 7813-7816, 7820-7822, and 7824.

The Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a compensable rating for bilateral tinea pedis of the feet. Here, there is no evidence that at any time under consideration the Veteran's tinea pedis of either foot affected at least 5, but less than 20, percent of the entire body or exposed areas, or required intermittent systemic therapy such as with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive drugs for a total duration of less than six weeks during the past 12-month period, criteria required for a 10 percent rating under the General Rating Formula for the skin. To this end, a May 2023 VA skin examination report reflects that the Veteran's tinea pedis affected less than 5 percent of the total body area and exposed area, and that the use of intermittent systemic therapy was not shown. Although the Veteran reported on examination that he used ketoconazole, such topical medications are not systemic therapy. See Johnson v. Shulkin, 862 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2017). VA treatment records also reflect that the Veteran was on medication for his tinea pedis. Thus, the criteria for a 10 percent rating under Code 7813 are not met, and a compensable rating for tinea pedis of bilateral feet is not warranted. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

ii) A compensable rating for allergic rhinitis is denied. 

The Veteran seeks a compensable rating for his rhinitis. 

On November 28, 2022, VA received the Veteran's Intent to File. On January 10, 2023, VA received a formal claim for an increased rating for his rhinitis (also claimed as sinusitis). See VA Form 21-526 EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation), received on January 10, 2023. 

The Veteran's rhinitis is currently assigned a noncompensable rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522. Under Diagnostic Code 6522, allergic or vasomotor rhinitis warrants a 10 percent rating where there are no polyps, but with greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522. A maximum 30 percent rating is for application when allergic rhinitis causes polyps. Id.

The Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a compensable rating for rhinitis. VA examined the Veteran to determine the current (then) severity of his rhinitis in May 2023.  A physical examination did not show that there was an obstruction of the nasal passage on either side due to rhinitis that was greater than 50 percent; and it did not show complete obstruction on either side due to rhinitis. Additionally, while permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates was present, nasal polyps and granulomatous conditions were not identified. There were no other pertinent physical findings related to allergic rhinitis, and there were no related scars. The diagnosis was allergic rhinitis. The examiner noted that the Veteran's allergic rhinitis did not pose any functional limitations and did not impact his ability to work.

A review of the VA treatment records did not reveal findings contrary to those found in the May 2023 VA examination report. That is, there is no indication in the treatment records that the Veteran's allergic rhinitis caused greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. Likewise, there was no description of polyps at any time.

The Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a compensable rating for the service-connected chronic allergic rhinitis. The evidence of record fails to demonstrate rhinitis with either greater than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or with complete obstruction on one side. Although the Veteran reported his belief that his disability is greater than currently rated, the medical evidence of record, particularly the May 2023 VA examination report did not document a 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides, a complete obstruction on one side, or the presence of polyps. Despite the Veteran's contentions, the treatment records and VA examination of record do not reflect symptomatology meeting the rating criteria for a 10 percent rating pursuant to DC 6522. 

As such, a compensable rating for allergic rhinitis is denied.
