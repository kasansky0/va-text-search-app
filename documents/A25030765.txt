ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for chronic lymphocytic leukemia is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a November 2024 correspondence, the Veteran withdrew his claim of entitlement to service connection for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1986 to July 2011.

The matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a June 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The rating decision on appeal constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In June 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a June 13, 2024 decision. On June 26, 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior June 13, 2024 decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 13, 2024 decision and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 13, 2024 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for chronic lymphocytic leukemia is dismissed.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 19.55. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. Id. 

A November 2024 statement from the Veteran indicates that he authorized his representative to withdraw his appeal on his behalf and that this would end of all of appeals before the VA. This statement identified the issue on appeal as entitlement to service connection for chronic lymphocytic leukemia as well as the date of the underlying rating decision and VA Form 10182.

The Board finds the Veteran's withdrawal to be clear, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action. See DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45, 57 (2011). The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. This request for withdrawal of the issue on appeal meets the content, form, and timing requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 and is, therefore, deemed a withdrawal of the claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205; see also Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1 (2020).

As a result, no allegation of error of fact or law remains before the Board for consideration with regard to the issues. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction over this issue, and the appeal is dismissed. As such, the Veteran has withdrawn his appeal concerning the issue listed above, and there remains no allegations of error or fact or law for appellate consideration therein.
