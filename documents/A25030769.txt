REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from July 2015 to July 2023.

On August 23, 2017, the President signed into law the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

These matters are on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision.  In February 2024, the Veteran timely appealed the January 2024 decision to the Board by requesting the AMA Direct Review lane.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Thus, in this case, the Board has not considered any evidence added to the claims file after the January 2024 rating decision.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence added to the claims file after January 22, 2024, he should submit a supplemental claim and identify that evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 5108; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

Dismissed Claims

In July 2023, the Veteran submitted a claim of entitlement to service connection for anxiety, depression, and a left ankle disability.  See July 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ.  A November 2024 rating decision granted service connection for adjustment disorder with anxiety and depressed mood and left lateral collateral ligament sprain (left ankle), each effective July 22, 2023, the date of his service connection claim.

As a general matter, the grant of a claim of service connection constitutes an award of full benefits sought on an appeal of the denial of a service connection claim.  See Seri v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 441, 447 (2007), see also Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (holding that a separate notice of disagreement must be filed to initiate appellate review of "downstream" elements such as the disability rating or effective date assigned).  Without an issue on appeal, the Board does not have jurisdiction.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104; see Barrera v. Gober, 122 F.3d 1030, 1032 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

Given the grant of service connection for adjustment disorder with anxiety and depression and a left ankle disability in the November 2024 rating decision, there are no remaining allegations of error of fact or law for the Board to adjudicate with respect to the claims of entitlement to service connection for anxiety, depression, and a left ankle disability.  Thus, the claims for service connection for anxiety, depression, and a left ankle disability have been granted in full and are dismissed by the Board.  Grantham, supra.; see also 38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303 (a). Service connection requires competent evidence showing: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see also Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).

Pertinent to a claim for service connection, such a determination requires a finding of current disability that is related to an injury or disease in service.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992).  The requirement of a current disability is satisfied when the Veteran has a disability at the time he files his service connection claim or during the pendency of that claim, even if the disability resolves prior to the adjudication of the claim.  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  However, when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim for benefits based on that disability, the report of the diagnosis is relevant evidence that the Board must address in determining whether a current disability existed at the time of the claim was filed or during its pendency.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013).  Under applicable regulation, the term "disability" means impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries and their residual conditions.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1; see also Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990); Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1364-65 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

As a preliminary matter, in December 2023 correspondence VA notified the Veteran that an examination was requested in his claims.  However, the Veteran did not appear for the scheduled VA examinations and failed to provide good cause for failing to attend the examinations.  Accordingly, the claims shall be rated based on the evidence of record.  38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).  A claimant has a duty to report for VA examination and must accept the legal consequences for failing to report for good cause.  See Turk v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 565, 567 (2008).  Therefore, the Board will decide this claims on the merits.  To this end, the duty to assist is a two-way-street.  Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991).

1. Left knee

The Veteran contends that he has a left knee disability related to his service.  However, he is uncertain regarding the cause of the claimed left knee disability.  See July 2023 Claim.

The service treatment records (STRs) include August 2015 and August 2017 reports which indicate complaints of left knee pain.  

However, there are no post-service medical records which indicate a diagnosis of any left knee disability during the period on appeal.

The Board finds that the claim must be denied.  The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran had any diagnosed left knee disability at the time of the January 2024 rating decision on appeal.  Accordingly, service connection is denied.  See Brammer, supra; see also McClain, supra; Romanowsky, supra; Saunders, supra.

To the extent that the Veteran has experienced any symptoms of pain during the period on appeal, there is no indication that any subjective complaints resulted in functional impairment of earning capacity.  See Hunt, supra; Saunders, supra.  More importantly, there was no objective evidence of any diagnosed left knee disability at that time.  Consequently, the Board finds that, at no time during the pendency of the claim did the Veteran have a current diagnosis of a left knee disability and the record does not contain a recent diagnosis of disability prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim.  Therefore, service connection for a left knee disability is not warranted.

2. Tinnitus

The Veteran contends that he has "ear-ringing" related to his service.  Specifically, he contends that he was in close proximity to loud machinery for 6 to 8 hours a day.  See July 2023 Claim.

The STRs include a February 2023 note which shows that the Veteran complained of a significant disturbance from tinnitus.

However, there are no post-service medical records which indicate a diagnosis of tinnitus.

The Board finds that the claim must be denied.  The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had any tinnitus at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the July 2023 claim.  Accordingly, service connection is denied.  See Brammer, supra; see also McClain, supra; Romanowsky, supra; Saunders, supra.

To the extent that the Veteran has experienced any ringing of his ears, there is no indication that any subjective complaints resulted in functional impairment of earning capacity.  See Hunt, supra; Saunders, supra.  More importantly, there is no objective evidence of any diagnosed tinnitus.  Consequently, the Board finds that, at no time during the pendency of the claim did the Veteran have a current diagnosis of tinnitus and the record does not contain a recent diagnosis of disability prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim.  Therefore, service connection for tinnitus is not warranted.

3. Left and right shoulder

The Veteran contends that he has bilateral shoulder disability that is related to his service.  Specifically, he contends that his disability is related to working on aircraft with heavy parts that he lifted overhead.  See July 2023 Claim.

The STRs are void of any findings, complaints, symptoms, or diagnosis related to any right or left shoulder disability. 

Moreover, there are no post-service medical records which indicate a diagnosis of any right or left shoulder disability.

The Board finds that the claims must be denied.  The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had any right or left shoulder disability at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the July 2023 claim.  Accordingly, service connection is denied.  See Brammer, supra; see also McClain, supra; Romanowsky, supra; Saunders, supra.

To the extent that the Veteran has experienced any right or left shoulder pain, there is no indication that any subjective complaints resulted in functional impairment of earning capacity.  See Hunt, supra; Saunders, supra.  More importantly, there is no objective evidence of any diagnosed right or left shoulder disability.  Consequently, the Board finds that, at no time during the pendency of the claim did the Veteran have a currently diagnosed right or left shoulder disability and the record does not contain a recent diagnosis of disability prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim.  Therefore, service connection for a bilateral shoulder disability is not warranted.

4. Sleep disorder

The Veteran contends that he has sleep disorder, claimed as sleep disturbance, that is related to his service.  However, he is uncertain regarding the cause of the claimed sleep disorder.  See July 2023 Claim.

The STRs include an April 2019 note which reflects the Veteran's complaint of sleep issues.  An August 2020 note indicates a diagnosis of sleep disorder, unspecified.  

However, there are no post-service medical records which indicate a diagnosis of any sleep disorder.

The Board finds that the claim must be denied.  The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had any sleep disorder at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the July 2023 claim.  Accordingly, service connection is denied.  See Brammer, supra; see also McClain, supra; Romanowsky, supra; Saunders, supra.

To the extent that the Veteran has experienced any sleep problems, there is no indication that any subjective complaints resulted in functional impairment of earning capacity.  See Hunt, supra; Saunders, supra.  More importantly, there is no objective evidence of any diagnosed sleep disorder.  Consequently, the Board finds that, at no time during the pendency of the claim did the Veteran have a currently diagnosed sleep disorder and the record does not contain a recent diagnosis of disability prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim.  Therefore, service connection for a sleep disorder is not warranted.

The Board has taken the contention that the Veteran has a left knee disability, tinnitus, a bilateral shoulder disability, and sleep disorder that were caused by service, seriously.  The Board has also closely reviewed the medical and lay evidence in the Veteran's claims file and finds no evidence that may serve as a medical nexus between the Veteran's service and his claimed disabilities.  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, see Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011), the specific issue in this case, the existence of a left knee disability, tinnitus, a bilateral shoulder disability, and a sleep disorder during the period on appeal, falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (lay persons not competent to diagnose cancer).

In light of the above discussion, the Board is not persuaded that the evidence supports granting service connection for a left knee disability, tinnitus, a bilateral shoulder disability, and a sleep disorder.  As such, these claims are denied.
