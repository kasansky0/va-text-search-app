DOCKET NO. 200506-86124
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On March 27, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received written notification from the Veteran's representative noting a withdrawal from appellate status regarding the issues listed above was requested. The statement was explicit, unambiguous, and included the necessary information required by 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. As such, the withdrawal was effective upon its receipt by VA.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to a TDIU have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1967 to February 1970.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a April 2020 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

Most recently, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) dismissed the Veteran's claim seeking entitlement to a TDIU in an August 2023 decision. The Veteran appealed the Board's August 2023 decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).  Pursuant to a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR), the Court, in a December 2024 Order, vacated the Board's decision and remanded the matter to the Board for action consistent with the directives of the JMR.  

Withdrawal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. An appeal withdrawal is effective when received by the Board. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205 (b)(3). Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In the present case, the Veteran confirmed he was withdrawing the hearing docket for the claim of entitlement to a TDIU. See March 2025 Correspondence.  The statement contained the Veteran's name, VA file number and note that he wished to withdrawal his claim.  Id.

The Board finds that the criteria for withdrawal of this appeal have been met as the Veteran's withdrawal is in compliance with 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Applying the relevant VA regulation, the Board finds the Veteran properly withdrew his claim.

Thus, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the appeal and it is dismissed.
