FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim that was received on August 29, 2020, seeking service connection for disabilities affecting her lumbar spine and bilateral hip; those claims were denied in a November 2020 rating decision.

2. The Veteran continuously pursued her claims for service connection following the issuance of the November 2020 rating decision until the rating decision on appeal granted service connection for the lumbar spine and bilateral hip disabilities effective September 29, 2022, the date on which a subsequent VA Form 20-0995 was received.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active duty service from February 1979 to February 1999.

In February 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a January 2023 rating decision. In May 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued an HLR decision in which it identified duty to assist errors and mandated a special review of the Veteran's file. The rating decision on appeal, which was reviewed under the supplemental claim process, was issued in December 2023.

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 29, 2022, for the grant of service connection for a lumbar spine disability.

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 29, 2022, for the grant of service connection for left hip degenerative arthritis.

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 29, 2022, for the grant of service connection for impairment of left thigh.

4. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 29, 2022, for the grant of service connection for right hip degenerative arthritis.

Service connection for the lumbar spine disability (lumbar spine degenerative disc disease (DDD) and degenerative joint disease (DJD), myofascial lumbar syndrome); left hip degenerative arthritis; impairment of left thigh; and right hip degenerative arthritis was established in the December 2023 rating decision on appeal, which assigned a 40 percent rating for the lumbar spine, a 30 percent rating for the left hip arthritis, and 10 percent ratings for the impairment of left thigh and right hip arthritis, all effective September 29, 2022. This date was noted by the AOJ to be the date on which a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim was received. 

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for these disabilities, asserting that he continuously pursued a claim filed on August 29, 2020, and that the effective date should be August 29, 2020. See January 2024 VA Form 10182 and attached statement. The Board agrees.

Under the modernized review system, the effective date of an award of disability compensation shall be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in paragraph (c) of this section within one year of the issuance of the decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (h). Following notice of a decision on an initial claim or a supplemental claim by the AOJ, a claimant may continuously pursue a claim or an issue by timely and properly filing any one of the following: (1) a supplemental claim; (2) a request for higher-level review; or (3) an appeal to the Board. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500 (c)(1).

The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, that was received on August 29, 2020, seeking to reopen claims for service connection for a lumbar spine disability and a bilateral hip disability. These were denied in a November 2020 rating decision. The Veteran timely submitted VA Forms 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR in November 2021 and the claims were denied in a December 2021 rating decision. 

The Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim that was received on September 29, 2022; he subsequently filed a VA Form 10182 received in November 2022 that was not accepted by the Board given the filing of the September 2022 supplemental claim. See December 2022 letter. The claims were again denied in a January 2023 rating decision. As noted above, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR in February 2023 and the AOJ issued a rating decision in May 2023 in which it identified duty to assist errors. The rating decision on appeal was issued in December 2023.

It is clear from this procedural history that the Veteran continuously pursued the claims for service connection for disabilities of the lumbar spine and bilateral hip after filing the August 29, 2020, supplemental claim by submitting timely requests for HLR and subsequent supplemental claims after the November 2020 rating decision denied the claims filed in August 2020, ultimately culminating in the timely filing of the VA Form 10182 in January 2024. 

The Board must now determine on what date the Veteran was entitled to a grant of service connection for these disabilities, since regulations provide that the effective date for the grant of service connection is the later of the date of claim or the date entitlement arose.

The December 2023 rating decision on appeal is confusing since it appears to grant service connection for each disability on a direct basis pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.303, but the Veteran has consistently sought service connection on a secondary basis and the VA opinions obtained following the May 2023 rating decision that identified duty to assist errors were opinions that established service connection for these disabilities as secondary to the Veteran's service-connected bilateral foot hallux valgus, not as directly related to service.

The VA opinions obtained by the AOJ were authored in June 2023, and essentially state that the Veteran's lumbar spine and bilateral hip disabilities are secondary to the service-connected right and left foot hallux valgus with rationale that it is common medical knowledge that pedal pathology such as hallux valgus adversely affect ones' posture and gait causing undue and added strain and burden to the upstream joints including the knees, hips and back. The examiner also noted that this Veteran developed lumbar spine and bilateral hip issues after service as her service-connected foot condition deteriorated and that given this discussion, a nexus is clear.

In addition to the VA opinions discussed above, the medical evidence of record includes a document dated July 24, 2020, that included opinions authored by Dr. C.C. This document was received on August 29, 2020, in conjunction with the supplemental claim seeking to establish service connection for disabilities of the lumbar spine and bilateral hip. Dr. C. provided opinions that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's current right and left hip degenerative arthritis and her lumbar spine hypertrophy of the facet joints and ligamentum flavum and superior herniation of the disc are secondary to, related to, and/or aggravated by the service-connected left foot hallux valgus with associated compensatory walking strategies with biomechanical and kinematic changes. This opinion, which is essentially identical to the opinion provided in June 2023 by the VA examiner, is afforded high probative value. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 302-04 (2008) (holding that it is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion that contributes to the probative value of a medical opinion).

Since the medical evidence of record at the time the Veteran's August 29, 2020, supplemental claim was received includes a probative private opinion establishing that her lumbar spine and bilateral hip disabilities are secondary to her service-connected bilateral foot hallux valgus, the Board finds that the effective date for the grants of service connection for the lumbar spine and bilateral hip disabilities should have been the date the claim was received on August 29, 2020. 

This represents a full grant as to the benefit sought on appeal as this is the effective date requested by the Veteran.
