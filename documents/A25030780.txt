ORDER

The reduction of the disability rating for the lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) from 20 percent to 10 percent, from September 2, 2022, was improper; restoration of the 20 percent rating is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A September 2022 rating decision reduced the disability rating for the Veteran's service-connected lumbosacral strain, from 20 percent to 10 percent from September 2, 2022. 

2. At the time of the September 2022 reduction for the Veteran's service-connected lumbosacral strain, the evidence of record was insufficient to show that the Veteran's disability had improved sufficiently to warrant a reduction from 20 percent to 10 percent.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

1. The criteria for a proper reduction of service-connected lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) from 20 to 10 percent, from September 2, 2022, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 501, 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105 (e), 3.344, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 5237.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1996 to September 1997, February 2001 to March 2002, and from March 2002 to October 2004.   

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in July 2023 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act.

In March 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a September 2022 decision.  In July 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior September 2022 decision.  

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the September 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim of reduction for lumbosacral strain from 20 percent to 10 percent, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The reduction of the disability rating for the lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) from 20 percent to 10 percent, from September 2, 2022, was improper; restoration of the 20 percent rating is granted.

The Board finds that the reduction of the Veteran's rating for his service-connected lumbosacral strain to be improper. 

A set of procedural safeguards governing rating reductions is outlined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.105, which are required to be followed by the VA before it issues any final rating reduction.  Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 418 (1993).  

If a reduction in the evaluation of a disability is considered warranted and the lower evaluation would result in a reduction or discontinuance of the compensation payments currently being made, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) must issue a rating decision proposing the reduction and setting forth all material facts and reasons.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e).  A period of 60 days is allowed for response.  Id.  The AOJ must notify the beneficiary that he or she will be given 60 days to present evidence to show that compensation payments should be continued at the present level.  Id.  Additionally, the beneficiary must be notified as to the right to a predetermination hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (i). Furthermore, the effective date of the reduction will be the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final rating action expires. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e), (i).

The AOJ issued a rating decision in September 2022 which reduced the rating for the Veteran's service-connected lumbosacral strain from 20 to 10 percent.  No notice was provided to the Veteran prior to the reduction.  However, here, the Board finds that no notice was required, as there was no actual reduction to the Veteran's overall compensation benefits.  Prior to the September 2022 rating decision, the Veteran had a combined rating of 90 percent.  After, the September 2022 reduction for his lumbosacral strain, effective September 2, 2022, the Veteran's overall combined evaluation was 90 percent. The Veteran's overall combined 90 percent rating was never decreased.  The Board notes that the Veteran was thereafter awarded a combined 100 percent disability rating from August 22, 2022.  See December 9, 2023 Rating Decision - Codesheet.  

As such, the rating reduction did not result in a reduction of the overall compensation payment, therefore, the notice requirement under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) is not required.

With the proper procedural steps completed, the question then becomes whether the reduction itself was proper.

After reviewing the evidence of record, the Board finds that the reduction of the Veteran's lumbosacral strain rating from 20 percent to 10 percent, from September 2, 2022, was not proper, and a restoration of the 20 percent is warranted.

Substantively, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (c), when a disability rating has been in effect for less than five years, reexaminations disclosing improvement will warrant a rating reduction.  However, not only must it be determined that an improvement in a disability has actually occurred, but also that the improvement actually reflects an improvement in the veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 349 (2000).  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, and 4.10 also require that a reduction in rating be based upon review of the entire history of a veteran's disability.  The evidence must reflect an actual change in the veteran's condition and not merely a difference in the thoroughness of the examination or in the use of descriptive terms.  38 C.F.R. § 4.13.

Additional requirements are set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (a) and (b), but these other provisions only apply to ratings that have continued for long periods at the same level (meaning 5 years or more).  This is not the situation here since the Veteran's disability rating have been in effect for less than five years at the time of the reduction. Here, the Veteran was assigned a 20 percent rating effective June 22, 2021.  

Significantly, in a rating reduction case, the burden is on VA to show improvement, and it is not on the veteran, as is the case in a typical increased rating claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5112; 38 C.F.R. § 3.105.  A rating reduction case focuses on the propriety of the reduction.  Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 282, 286 (1991).  In considering the propriety of a reduction, the Board must focus on the evidence available to the AOJ at the time the reduction was effectuated, although post-reduction medical evidence may be considered in the context of evaluating whether the condition had demonstrated actual improvement.  Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277 (1991).

The question of whether a disability has improved involves consideration of the applicable rating criteria.  For the rating period at issue, lumbosacral strain was rated under the criteria found at 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5237, which falls under the schedule or ratings for musculoskeletal system.   

Under the General Rating Formula for Diseases and Injuries of the Spine, a 10 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height. 

A 20 percent rating is warranted for forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or, muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. 

Normal ranges of motion of the thoracolumbar spine are flexion from 0 to 90 degrees; extension from 0 to 30 degrees; lateral flexion bilaterally from 0 to 30 degrees; and rotation bilaterally from 0 to 30 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate V.

Any associated objective neurological abnormalities, including, but not limited to, bowel or bladder impairment, are to be evaluated separately under an appropriate diagnostic code. Id. at Note 1.

Ankylosis is defined as "immobility and consolidation of a joint due to disease, injury, or surgical procedure." Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 94 (32nd ed. 2012). Fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position (zero degrees) always represents favorable ankylosis. Id. at Note 5.

When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular Diagnostic Code, the higher evaluation is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt remaining is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § § 3.102, 4.3.

Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or infection in the parts of the system, to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance.  It is essential that the examination on which ratings are based adequately portray the anatomical damage, and the functional loss, with respect to all these elements. The functional loss may be due to absence of part, or all, of the necessary bones, joints and muscles, or associated structures, or to deformity, adhesions, defective innervation, or other pathology, or it may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by visible behavior of the claimant undertaking the motion.  Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part that becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45; DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 206 -07 (1995); Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 37 92011) ("functional loss caused by pain must be rated at the same level as if that functional loss were caused by some other factor...that actually limited motion" (emphasis removed)).   Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in §§ 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a (musculoskeletal system) or § 4.73 (muscle injury); a separate or higher rating under §§ 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016). 

The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 acknowledge that a claimant's disability may cause actual pain or painful motion but still not be severe enough to warrant a compensable rating under the appropriate Code.  Pain alone does not rise to the level of functional loss as contemplated by VA regulations applicable to the musculoskeletal system.  Pain in, like deformity of or insufficient nerve supply to, a particular joint may result in functional loss, but only if it limits the ability to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination and endurance.  Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 38-39 (2011).

The Board must also consider whether VA examiners have elicited information concerning the "severity, frequency, duration, or functional loss manifestations" of such flare-ups. Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017).

The Court also has issued the opinion of Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), which clarifies additional requirements that VA examiners should address when assessing musculoskeletal disabilities, holding specifically, that the joints involved should be tested for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with the range of the opposite undamaged joint.

In order to determine whether actual improvement has been shown, the Board first examines the evidence on which the Veteran's 20 percent rating for lumbosacral strain is based. The Veteran's 20 percent rating was granted in an August 2021 rating decision (effective June 22, 2021) based on a July 2021 VA examination.  

The July 2021 examiner confirmed the Veteran's lumbosacral strain diagnosis. The Veteran reported back pain, stiffness, limited range of motion, difficulty with heavy lifting, bending, prolonged walking and climbing stairs.  

Range of motion testing revealed flexion to 75 degrees, extension to 25 degrees, right and left lateral flexion to 25 degrees each, right and left lateral rotation to 25 degrees each.  There was no change in range of motion upon passive range of motion testing. Pain was noted upon forward flexion, extension, right lateral flexion and right lateral rotation.  Pain upon weight-bearing, active and passive motion was also noted which did not result in functional loss.  Repetitive use testing with at least three repetitions revealed flexion to 70 degrees, extension to 20 degrees, right and left lateral flexion to 20 degrees each, right and left lateral rotation to 20 degrees each. The Veteran was not examined immediately after repeated use over time, but estimated range of motion for such was noted to be flexion to 60 degrees, extension to 15 degrees, right and left lateral flexion to 15 degrees each, right and left lateral rotation to 15 degrees each. 

The Veteran did not have muscle spasms or guarding, nor did he report flare-ups.  Muscle strength testing was normal. He did not have muscle atrophy, IVDS, or ankylosis. Deep tendon reflexes and sensory testing were normal. The Veteran did not use any assistive devices. See July 27, 2021 VA examination report.

Next, the Board considers the evidence on which the reduction from 20 to 10 percent was based. The September 2022 rating decision, which reduced the Veteran's rating for lumbosacral strain from 20 percent to 10 percent, was based on the Veteran's September 2022 VA examination.  See September 2, 2022, VA examination report.  

The September 2022 VA examination confirmed the Veteran's lumbosacral strain diagnosis and noted a diagnosis of degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease.  The Veteran reported that his back pain interferes with his job as a delivery truck driver and has pain getting in and out of his truck cab.  The Veteran reported he is a truck driver and has had difficulty seeking treatment with his job and that he self-treats with ibuprofen. The Veteran did not report flare-ups. 

The examiner noted no change in the one year since his last VA examination and there is no evidence that he has been treated since separation.  The examiner noted that he has a normal gait, good strength and a negative straight leg raise test.  

Range of motion testing revealed flexion to 70 degrees, extension to 25 degrees, right and left lateral flexion to 30 degrees each, right and left lateral rotation to 30 degrees each. There was no change in range of motion upon passive range of motion testing. Pain upon weight-bearing and active motion was noted which did result in functional loss of pain with pushing, pulling, climbing in and out of the cab of his truck.  

The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing with at least three repetitions with no additional loss of function or range of motion. The Veteran was not examined immediately after repeated use over time, but estimated range of motion for such was noted to be the same as the initial range of motion measurements with the exception of extension to 20 degrees. The Veteran did not have muscle spasms or guarding.  Muscle strength testing was normal. He did not have muscle atrophy, IVDS, or ankylosis. Deep tendon reflexes and sensory testing were normal. The Veteran did not use any assistive devices. 

38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (a) specifically states that diseases subject to temporary or episodic improvement will not be reduced on any one examination, except when the evidence of record shows that sustained improvement has been demonstrated.

Here, the Veteran's lumbosacral strain rating was reduced based on one VA examination, the September 2022 VA examination.  Moreover, the Board finds that this examination did not show sustained improvement, as is required by 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (a).  This is evidenced by the September 2022 examiner noting no change since his July 2021 VA examination.  Furthermore, the Veteran has consistently reported functional loss directly related to his job as a truck driver, as pain with pushing, pulling and climbing in and out of the cab of his truck.  

Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds the evidence is insufficient to show a sustained improvement of the Veteran's lumbosacral strain disability, and that it actually reflects an improvement in the veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.  Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 349 (2000).

As a result, the Board finds that the reduction was improper because the AOJ did not consider whether the evidence made it reasonably certain that the improvement would be maintained under the ordinary conditions of life.  38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (a). Restoration of the 20 percent rating is warranted.
