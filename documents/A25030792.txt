ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for cancer - breast (breast cancer) is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral mastectomy and axillary lymph node removal is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's cancer - breast (breast cancer) was not incurred in or caused by service. 

2. The Veteran's bilateral mastectomy and axillary lymph node removal was not incurred in or caused by service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for cancer - breast (breast cancer) have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1117, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102; 3.303, 3.317.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral mastectomy and axillary lymph node removal have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1117, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102; 3.303, 3.317.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from April 2011 to August 2015 and is a Persian Gulf Veteran within the meaning of the regulation, 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e), as she served on active duty in the Southwest Asia theater of operations in the UAE from March 23, 2012, to October 3, 2012.

The Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) creates a new framework for Veterans dissatisfied with Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) decision on their claim to seek review. The AMA became effective on February 19, 2019. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1). The AMA applies to all initial decisions issued after February 19, 2019.

The present matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from the March 2024 rating decision issued by VA Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). Accordingly, this decision is subject to the AMA.

In December 2023, the Veteran's claims for service connection for her breast cancer and the bilateral mastectomy and axillary lymph node removal were denied. In March 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996: Request for Higher Level Review (HLR), for the December 2023 rating decision. In a March 2024 HLR rating decision, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for the breast cancer and the bilateral mastectomy and axillary lymph node removal.??  

The Veteran timely appealed the March 2024 rating decision to the Board in a May 2024, VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement. Based on the Veteran's selection of the direct review docket, the Board may only consider evidence on record at the time of the March 2024 rating decision.

Service Connection

Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009); see also Pond v. West, 12 Vet. App. 341 (1999).

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Additionally, the Board notes that service connection may be granted on a presumptive basis for a Persian Gulf Veteran who exhibits objective indications of qualifying chronic disability, including resulting from undiagnosed illness or MUCMI that became manifest either during active service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War, or to a degree of 10 percent or more not later than December 21, 2026, and which by history, physical examination, and laboratory tests cannot be attributed to any known clinical diagnosis. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317. On August 10, 2022, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act of 2022 (PACT Act) was enacted and amended 38 U.S.C. § 1117 such that it expanded the definition of Persian Gulf Veteran to include Veterans who served in Afghanistan, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Syria, and Jordan along with those who served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations. P.L. 117-168. The PACT Act also favorably amended § 1117 to provide that the qualifying chronic disability can become manifest "to any degree at any time." See 38 U.S.C. § 1117(a)(1). Section 3.317 has not yet been revised to implement these changes.

The term, MUCMI, means a diagnosed illness without conclusive pathophysiology or etiology, that is characterized by overlapping symptoms and signs and has features such as fatigue, pain, disability out of proportion to physical findings, and inconsistent demonstration of laboratory abnormalities. Id. "Objective indications of chronic disability" include both "signs," in the medical sense of objective evidence perceptible to an examining physician, and other, non-medical indicators that are capable of independent verification. Id. For purposes of Gulf War undiagnosed illness and MUCMI claims, disabilities that have existed for six months or more and disabilities that exhibit intermittent episodes of improvement and worsening over a six-month period will be considered chronic. The six-month period of chronicity will be measured from the earliest date on which the pertinent evidence establishes that the signs or symptoms of the disability first became manifest. Id. A qualifying chronic disability referred to in this section shall be considered service connected for purposes of all laws of the United States. Id.

Moreover, service connection under this provision is precluded if there is affirmative evidence that the disability was unrelated to service in Southwest Asia theater of operations, Afghanistan, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Syria, or Jordan. 38 U.S.C. § 1117, 38 C.F.R. § 3.317.

Although entitlement to service connection on any of the presumptive bases noted above may not be established, a Veteran is not precluded from establishing service connection on a direct basis. See 38 U.S.C. § 1113(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d) (the availability of service connection on a presumptive basis does not preclude consideration of service connection on a direct basis); See Combee v. Brown, 34 F.3d 1039, 1043-44 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

Whenever there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

1. Entitlement to service connection for cancer - breast (breast cancer)

2. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral mastectomy and axillary lymph node removal

The Veteran maintains that her breast cancer and bilateral mastectomy and axillary lymph node removal are caused by toxic exposure during her deployment to the UAE in 2012.  

Initially, the Board notes that entitlement to service connection on a presumptive basis under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317 is not warranted as the Veteran does not have a MUCMI or an undiagnosed chronic condition, nor is her breast cancer and mastectomy with node removal a presumptive condition under section 3.317. 

Turning to entitlement to service connection on a direct basis due to TERA exposure, with regard to a current disability, the AOJ made favorable findings in the March 2024 rating decision that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of left breast cancer and bilateral modified radical mastectomies with bilateral axillary lymphadenectomy. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Therefore, the first element of service connection, a current disability, is established.

With regard to in-service incurrence, the AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity (TERA), and the Board is bound by this favorable finding. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). Therefore, the in-service incurrence element has been conceded by VA and is established.

With respect to a nexus, service treatment records (STRs) are silent as to the claimed conditions in service. See October 2022 STR. The Veteran was afforded VA examinations for the claimed conditions in November 2023. A TERA opinion was obtained in December 2023 to address the findings of the November 2023 VA examinations. The examiner opined that the claimed conditions were less likely than not caused by the indicated toxic exposure after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. As rationale, the examiner remarked that there is no medical or scientific evidence available that links the Veteran's conditions and the exposures listed in the TERA. Additionally, the examiner stated that the Veteran has a significant, non-military risk factor as it is noted she has a positive BRCA-1 gene mutation. The examiner completed a thorough review of the record as noted in the opinion, and the conclusion is adequately supported. The Board finds this opinion adequate and highly probative. 

Because the objective, medical evidence confirms the non-military related, BRCA1-gene pathogenic mutation, and the most probative evidence, the TERA opinion, points to that gene mutation in providing the negative nexus opinion, the Board finds that a nexus has not been established between the current disability and the in-service incurrence. This objective, medical evidence also serves as the affirmative evidence that the disability is unrelated to TERA exposures during service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations. 

In sum, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against the claim, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applicable. Accordingly, the elements of service connection have not been met and service connection is denied.
