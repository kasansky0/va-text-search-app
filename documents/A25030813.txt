FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence supports finding that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base.

2. The Veteran submitted a claim of service connection for type II diabetes mellitus on July 13, 2010, and his diabetes is presumptively related to in-service exposure to herbicide agents.

3. The Veteran submitted a claim of service connection for AL amyloidosis on June 7, 2018, and his AL amyloidosis is presumptively related to in-service exposure to herbicide agents.

4. The Veteran submitted a claim of service connection for coronary artery disease on June 7, 2018, and his coronary artery disease is presumptively related to in-service exposure to herbicide agents.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of July 13, 2010, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for type II diabetes mellitus have been met. 38?U.S.C. §§?1116, 5101, 5107, 5110; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.1, 3.102, 3.151, 3.307, 3.309, 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date of June 7, 2018, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for AL amyloidosis have been met. 38?U.S.C. §§?1116, 5101, 5107, 5110; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.1, 3.102, 3.151, 3.307, 3.309, 3.400.

3. The criteria for an effective date of June 7, 2018, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for coronary artery disease have been met. 38?U.S.C. §§?1116, 5101, 5107, 5110; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.1, 3.102, 3.151, 3.307, 3.309, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from February 1973 to August 1978. He died in December 2018. The Appellant is his surviving spouse, who has properly substituted in the appeal.

These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a higher-level review (HLR) rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in January 2024, originally stemming from a February 2023 rating decision. The Appellant selected the Direct Review docket without a Board hearing under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) by submitting a VA Form 10182 (Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement)). Accordingly, the Board's current review is limited to the evidence at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction's (AOJ's) February 2023 rating decision. The Board cannot consider any evidence submitted by the Veteran after the rating decision on appeal.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in this decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board notes that the Appellant's August 2023 request for HLR also expressed disagreement with the initial 10 percent rating assigned for coronary artery disease. However, the issue was not included in the January 2024 HLR rating decision. The Appellant noted this fact in a brief attached to her May 2024 Notice of Disagreement. Because the RO has not yet issued a HLR rating decision addressing the initial coronary artery disease rating, that issue is not ripe for review by the Board and cannot be addressed in this decision. Therefore, the matter is referred to the RO for issuance of a HLR rating decision.

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for type II diabetes mellitus

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for AL amyloidosis

3. Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for coronary artery disease

Generally, the effective date for a grant of service connection is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has made it clear that the date of the filing of a claim is controlling in determinations as to effective dates. See Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 380 (1999) (citing Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511 (1997); Washington v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 391 (1997); and Wright v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 343 (1997). In Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 380 (1999), the Court stated that the effective date of an award of service connection is not based upon the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating entitlement, but on the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was filed with VA.

The Board notes that the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act) was enacted with an effective date of August 10, 2022. Of relevance to this appeal, the PACT Act added a presumption of exposure to herbicide agents to all veterans who served in Thailand during the period from January 9, 1962, to June 30, 1976.

Prior to the enactment of the PACT Act, VA procedures for verifying exposure to herbicides in Thailand during the Vietnam Era are detailed in the VA Adjudication Manual, M21-1MR, Part IV, Subpart ii, Chapter 2, Section C ("M21-1MR") (2022). VA has determined that there was significant use of herbicides on the fenced-in perimeters of military bases in Thailand intended to eliminate vegetation and ground cover for base security purposes as evidenced in a declassified Vietnam era Department of Defense document titled "Project CHECO Southeast Asia Report: Base Defense in Thailand." Special consideration of herbicide exposure on a facts-found or direct basis should be extended to those Veterans whose duties placed them on or near the perimeters of Thailand military bases. This allows for presumptive service connection of the diseases associated with herbicide exposure.

The majority of troops in Thailand during the Vietnam Era were stationed at the Royal Thai Air Force Bases of U-Tapao, Ubon, Nakhon Phanom, Udorn, Takhli, Korat, and Don Muang. If a veteran served on one of these air bases as a security policeman, security patrol dog handler, member of a security police squadron, or otherwise served near the air base perimeter, as shown by military occupational specialty (MOS), performance evaluations, or other credible evidence, then herbicide exposure should be acknowledged on a facts-found or direct basis. However, this applies only during the Vietnam Era, from February 28, 1961, to May 7, 1975. See M21-1MR, Part IV, Subpart ii, Chapter 2, Section C.10. (q).

If a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active service, the following diseases shall be service-connected if the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6) are met, even though there is no record of such disease during service, provided further that the rebuttable presumption provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(d) are also satisfied: AL amyloidosis; chloracne or other acneform disease consistent with chloracne; Type 2 diabetes (also known as Type II diabetes mellitus or adult-onset diabetes); Hodgkin's disease; all chronic B cell leukemias; multiple myeloma; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Parkinson's disease; early-onset peripheral neuropathy; porphyria cutanea tarda; prostate cancer; respiratory cancers (cancer of the lung, bronchus, larynx or trachea); soft-tissue sarcoma (other than osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, or mesothelioma); and ischemic heart disease, (including, but not limited to, acute, subacute, and old myocardial infarction; atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease including coronary artery disease (including coronary spasm) and coronary bypass surgery; and stable, unstable and Prinzmetal's angina). 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 added parkinsonism, bladder cancer, and hypothyroidism to the list of diseases presumptively associated with exposure to herbicide agents, effective January 1, 2021. See 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(2).

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record. If credible, competent lay evidence means any evidence not requiring that the proponent have specialized education, training, or experience. Lay evidence is competent if it is provided by a person who has knowledge of facts or circumstances and conveys matters that can be observed and described by a lay person. 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.

A claimant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021). If "the positive and negative evidence is in approximate balance (which includes but is not limited to equipoise) the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt." Id.?

The Appellant asserts that she is entitled to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the awards of service connection for the Veteran's AL amyloidosis, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, and type II diabetes mellitus.

By way of history, the Veteran submitted a claim of service connection for type II diabetes on July 13, 2010, and his claims were denied in a November 2010 rating decision. The Veteran initiated a timely Board appeal of that rating decision, and the claim was remanded by the Board in August 2016. The Board denied service connection for diabetes in an April 2018 decision. The Veteran appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court), and in December 2019 the Court granted a Joint Motion for Remand (JMR) submitted by the parties. The Board again denied service connection for type II diabetes in a June 2020 decision. The Veteran appealed the decision to the Court, which granted another JMR in April 2021. Meanwhile, the Veteran submitted claims of service connection for AL amyloidosis and coronary artery disease on June 7, 2018, and his claims were denied in a July 2018 rating decision. The Veteran submitted a timely Board appeal of the rating decision. In September 2021, the Board remanded the issues of entitlement to service connection for type II diabetes mellitus, AL amyloidosis, and coronary artery disease for further development. Following the issuance of a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) in June 2022, the Appellant opted into the AMA review system by submitting a request for HLR in July 2022. An August 2022 HLR rating decision identified duty-to-assist errors with respect to the claims of service connection for diabetes, AL amyloidosis, and coronary artery disease. The February 2023 rating decision granted service connection for all of those disabilities pursuant to the PACT Act, effective August 10, 2022.

The Board first finds that the Appellant has continuously pursued the Veteran's claim of service connection for type II diabetes since July 13, 2010, and has continuously pursued the Veteran's claims for service connection for AL amyloidosis and coronary artery disease since June 7, 2018. The February 2023 rating decision granted service connection for all disabilities on appeal based on the PACT Act's expanded presumption of herbicide agents to all veterans who served in Thailand during the Vietnam War period. Thus, effective dates prior to August 10, 2022, will be warranted if the evidence supports awards of service connection on a basis other than the PACT Act. More specifically, in this case, earlier effective dates may be awarded if exposure to herbicide agents may be proven on a facts-found basis.

The Veteran's service personnel records indicate that he was stationed at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base from May 1975 to October 1975 as a squadron load crew member of the weapons loading section. His responsibilities included loading and unloading assigned munitions on aircraft. His service performance reports show consistently high ratings and recommendations for promotion.

In a September 2010 statement, the Veteran asserted that he was exposed to herbicide agents while serving in Thailand. He stated that he was stationed at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base from 1975 to 1976 and that he remembered spraying operations being conducted while he was there. He also indicated that one night in 1976, an intruder was seen climbing the perimeter fence. He stated that all American personnel were ordered out of the barracks and moved to the base perimeter while the buildings were searched. He stated that he stood in the dark for hours at the base perimeter while the search was conducted. In a June 2016 brief the Veteran, through his attorney, clarified that the incident with the intruder occurred in 1975. The Board, in an April 2018 decision, conceded that the Veteran was ordered out of his barracks and was at the perimeter of Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base.

In June 2018, the Veteran asserted that his duties as a munitions loader placed him along the perimeter fence at Udorn. He further indicated in August 2018 that he loaded armaments at the end of the runway, immediately adjacent to the perimeter fence. He noted that there was no grass along the fence and that exhaust from the jets kept the air full of dirt and light debris.

After considering the relevant evidence, the Board finds that an effective date of July 13, 2010, is warranted for the award of service connection for type II diabetes mellitus, and an effective date of June 7, 2018, is warranted for the awards of service connection for AL amyloidosis and coronary artery disease. In this regard, the evidence supports a finding that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents while stationed at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base. The Board previously conceded that he was at the perimeter of the Base on at least one occasion while authorities searched for an intruder, and the Veteran indicated that he stood at the perimeter for several hours. Further, the Veteran indicated that his duties as a munitions loader included loading munitions at the end of the runway, immediately adjacent to the perimeter fence, and that jet exhaust often scattered dirt and light debris near the perimeter.  The Board finds the Veteran's lay statements regarding duty on or near the perimeter of the Base to be competent, credible, and probative. The Veteran was competent to describe the nature of his service at Udorn and the frequency with which he was at or near the perimeter. The Veteran's statements are credible, as they are not in conflict with his personnel records or other probative evidence. His service performance reports also indicate good military character, weighing in favor of his credibility. Thus, the Board concludes that the evidence supports finding that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base. 

Having established exposure to herbicide agents on a facts-found basis, the Board notes that the Veteran's diabetes, AL amyloidosis, and coronary artery disease are all presumptively related to exposure to herbicide agents. See 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). Further, the Veteran's medical records support finding that he had diagnoses of type II diabetes mellitus, AL amyloidosis, and coronary artery disease at the time each respective claim was filed. Accordingly, an effective date of July 13, 2010, but no earlier, is warranted for the award of service connection for type II diabetes mellitus, and an effective date of June 7, 2018, but no earlier, is warranted for the awards of service connection for AL amyloidosis and coronary artery disease. The Veteran filed a claim of service connection for diabetes on July 13, 2010, and he filed claims of service connection for AL amyloidosis and coronary artery disease on June 7, 2018, and entitlement to service connection for those disabilities had arisen at the time the respective claims were filed. Prior to those dates, the Board found no evidence of any pending or unadjudicated claims for any of the disabilities on appeal, informal claims, or indications of intent to file a claim submitted within one year prior to either formal claim. Therefore, the Board concludes that an effective date of July 13, 2010, but no earlier, is warranted for the award of service connection for type II diabetes mellitus, and effective date of June 7, 2018, but no earlier, is warranted for the awards of service connection for AL amyloidosis and coronary artery disease. 38?U.S.C. §§?1116, 5101, 5107, 5110; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.1, 3.102, 3.151, 3.307, 3.309, 3.400.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, for the award of service connection for hypothyroidism is remanded.

Under the AMA, remand is permissible only for: (a) correction of pre-decisional duty to assist errors, to include examinations and medical opinions; and (b) correction of an AOJ error in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of such error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.

When VA undertakes the effort to provide an examination or medical opinion, the examination or medical opinion must be adequate. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007). Inadequate medical examinations include those that provide unsupported conclusions. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Barr, 21 Vet. App. at 311. It is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion that contributes probative value to a medical opinion. Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. at 304. VA must consider all lay and medical evidence of record. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1154(a), 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

VA has promulgated special rules to implement orders of a United States District Court in the class action of Nehmer v. U.S. Veterans Admin., 712 F. Supp. 1404 (N.D. Cal. 1989). See 38 C.F.R. § 3.816. The Nehmer litigation has created an exception to the generally applicable effective date rules contained in 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.114.

In pertinent part, a Nehmer class member is defined as a Vietnam veteran who has a covered herbicide disease. 38 C.F.R. § 3.816(b)(1)(i). A covered herbicide disease includes a disease for which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has established a presumption of service connection pursuant to the Agent Orange Act of 1991. 38 C.F.R. § 3.816 (b)(2). Here, hypothyroidism was added as a disease presumptively due to herbicide exposure on January 1, 2021. 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(2) was amended to include, in pertinent part, hypothyroidism among the list of diseases eligible for presumptive service connection based on herbicide agent exposure for Veterans exposed to herbicide agents. 

The Nehmer regulations provide for situations where the effective date can be earlier than the date of the liberalizing law, assuming a Nehmer class member has been granted compensation for a covered herbicide disease. Either (1) VA denied compensation for the same covered herbicide disease in a decision issued between September 25, 1985, and May 3, 1989; or (2) the class member's claim of disability compensation for the covered herbicide disease was either pending before VA on May 3, 1989, or was received by VA between May 3, 1989, and the effective date of the statute or regulations establishing a presumption of service connection for the covered disease (here, January 1, 2021). In these situations, the effective date of the award will be the later of the date such claim was received by VA or the date the disability arose, unless a claim was filed within one year of service discharge. 38 C.F.R. § 3.816(c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3). If neither circumstance exists, the effective date of the award of service connection shall be determined in accordance with either 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 or § 3.400. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.816(c)(4).

The Appellant asserts that an effective date prior to August 10, 2022, is warranted for the award of service connection for hypothyroidism. 

The Veteran submitted a claim of service connection for hypothyroidism on July 13, 2010, and the procedural history for that claim mirrors that for his claim for type II diabetes. Thus, the claim has been continuously pursued since July 13, 2010. Hypothyroidism was added as a disease presumptively related to herbicide agent exposure on January 1, 2021. See 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.816(b)(2). The provisions of Nehmer, which allow for an effective date prior to the date of a liberalizing law for Vietnam veterans, are not applicable in this case. Nehmer class membership is limited to Vietnam veterans and their survivors. 38 C.F.R. § 3.816(b)(1). In this case, although he was exposed to herbicide agents during the Vietnam War era, the Veteran's exposure occurred in Thailand. Therefore, the Veteran was not a Nehmer class member. Accordingly, an effective date prior to January 1, 2021, will be warranted only if the criteria for service connection are met on a basis other than the presumption related to herbicide agent exposure.

A VA medical opinion was issued in January 2023, wherein the examiner opined that the Veteran's hypothyroidism was at least as likely as not caused by his exposure to herbicide agents because hypothyroidism is a disability presumptively related to herbicide agent exposure.

The Board finds that the January 2023 VA medical opinion is inadequate, because the examiner's opinion relied solely on the fact that hypothyroidism is presumptively related to herbicide agent exposure. The opinion is insufficient to determine whether an earlier effective date is warranted for the award of service connection for hypothyroidism on a nonpresumptive basis because the examiner did not discuss direct service connection in any detail. The RO's failure to obtain an adequate VA medical opinion constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and a remand is warranted to obtain a new VA medical opinion, supported by adequate rationale, discussing whether the Veteran's hypothyroidism was at least as likely as not caused by his conceded in-service exposure to herbicide agents.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum medical opinion from the examiner who issued the January 2023 VA medical opinion or, if that examiner is unavailable then another similarly qualified examiner may respond instead. The entire claims file, including a copy of this remand, must be made available for review by the examiner, and such review should be noted in the examination report.

The examiner should opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's hypothyroidism had its onset during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or illness, to include his exposure to herbicide agents.

The examiner is advised that exposure to herbicide agents has been conceded and that the medical opinion cannot rely solely on the fact that hypothyroidism was added as a disease presumptively related to herbicide agents, effective January 1, 2021.

The examiner must provide a comprehensive rationale for each proffered opinion. The examiner is advised that, during his lifetime, the Veteran was competent to report his symptoms and history, and such reports are to be considered in formulating any opinion. 

If any opinion cannot be given without resorting to speculation, the examiner should explain why and state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the?state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), the?record (additional facts are required), or the examiner does not have the knowledge or training.?As appropriate, the AOJ should conduct additional development or supplement the record.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
