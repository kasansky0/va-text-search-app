ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for type II diabetes mellitus is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The persuasive weight of the probative evidence of record at this time is against a medical nexus between the Veteran's diagnosed type II diabetes mellitus and his claimed exposure to herbicide agents in Panama.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for type II diabetes mellitus have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the U.S. Army from September 1974 to February 1988.

A January 30, 2024 rating decision denied service connection for diabetes mellitus type II. The Veteran timely appealed this decision to the Board by requesting the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) Direct Review Lane for a reevaluation of the evidence considered by the AOJ. See February 2024 VA Form 10182. As this is a Direct Review appeal under the AMA, the record closed on the date of the January 2024 rating decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the respective AOJ decision. See id. If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision on the claim on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300.

Service Connection, Including Presumptive Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and; (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases will be presumed to have been incurred in service if manifested to a compensable degree of at least 10 percent disabling within one year after service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. If a chronic disease enumerated in 38 U.S.C. § 1101(a) or 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 is diagnosed after separation from service, the nexus requirement of a claim for service connection can be proven by evidence of a continuity of symptomatology. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

More specifically, VA has established a presumption of service connection for certain diseases found to be associated with herbicide exposure. See 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). Absent affirmative evidence to the contrary, such diseases will be service connected even if there is no evidence of the disease during service, provided that herbicide exposure is established. See 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(d), 3.309(e).

For certain military personnel who served during the Vietnam Era, an exposure to herbicide agents in service may be presumed, as a matter of law. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6). Where, as here, that presumption does not apply, the Board may determine that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents based on the specific facts of the case, that is, on a facts-found basis.

Where a veteran was exposed to herbicide agents during active service and certain diagnoses-including diabetes mellitus type II-become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more at any time after service, service connection shall be established for such disability if the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6) are met even though there is no record of that disease during service, provided that the rebuttable presumption provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(d) are also satisfied. 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). It follows, that when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not applied. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

1. Entitlement to service connection for type II diabetes mellitus is denied.

The Veteran contends that his current diabetes mellitus is related to his claimed exposure to the herbicide agent dioxin during his late 1970s service in Panama. See, e.g., December 2022 VA Form 21-526EZ; December 2022 Lay Statement. 

The AOJ made the favorable finding that the Veteran has a current disability diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, type II; therefore, the Board finds this element of service connection has been established. See January 2024 Rating Decision.

The Board next considers whether the evidence of record indicates that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents during service. In a January 2024 VA Toxic Risk Exposure Activity (TERA) Memorandum, the agency determined that the Veteran did not qualify for a presumption of exposure to herbicide agents. See January 2024 TERA Memorandum. 

The Veteran's military personnel records confirm service in Panama-specifically at the former Fort Clayton in the Panama Canal Zone. However, these records do not specifically refer to the Veteran's exposure to herbicide agents. See Overseas Service MPR (assoc'd with claims file August 8, 2023) (recording service at "SACA-Panama" from May 1975 to September 1977); August 11, 1977 MPR (transferring duty station from former Fort Clayton, Panama Canal Zone to former Fort Johnson (formerly Polk), Louisiana); July 16, 2010 MPR ("Response . . . No records of exposure to herbicides."). See also July 30, 1985 Application for Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card MPR (reporting marriage during service on August 27, 1976 in Bacboa Canal Zone, Panama); DD-214 MPR (assoc'd with claims file August 8, 2023) (recording enlistment location as Port Amador, Panama).

The Veteran also submitted lay testimony that during his Panama service, "our main job was to go into the jungle and do recon and war games" for "28 days in the jungle at a time." See December 2022 Lay Statement. He stated that he was not informed of any herbicide agent use on the foliage, but attributed the left side of his neck swelling to herbicide agent exposure after one in-service care provider asked if the Veteran had served in Vietnam following his Panama service, and after the Veteran was told in a VA appointment he had been exposed to Dioxin. See id. ("At one time I was asked if I was in Vietnam. I told them no, but I just got back from Panama. . . One day when I was in Charleston, SC (VA Hospital) I went to get a test done on me [and] found out that I have di[o]xin [exposure]."). Examining the Veteran's post-service treatment records, it appears he refers to his May 28, 2015 appointment involving his screening for VA's Agent Orange Registry. See May 28, 2015 CAPRI.

During this May 2015 appointment, the VA attending physician recorded that the Veteran "was deployed to Vietnam with boots on the ground for 24 hours in 1966, Thailand from 1966-1967, Korea from 1968-1971, and Panama from 1975-1977." This record of service does not reflect the Veteran's DD-214 nor his own testimony, as the record consistently reflects him serving from September 1974 to February 1988. See, e.g., December 2022 Lay Statement ("At one time I was asked if I was in Vietnam. I told them no, but I just got back from Panama."). The Board finds the pre-1974 account of the Veteran's service during the May 2015 Agent Orange Examination to be a typographical error because-in addition to contradicting the Veteran's recorded service elsewhere in this claims file-the Veteran would have been 11 years old for his stated Vietnam service, 11 to 12 years old during his stated Thailand service, and 13 to 16 years old during his stated Korea service. See, e.g., July 22, 1982 Medical Examination MPR (recording the Veteran was born in January 1955).

It is well-established that U.S. servicemembers who served in Vietnam during the Vietnam era were presumptively exposed to herbicide agents. See, e.g., 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(i). However, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has also admitted to the use of tactical herbicides within the territorial United States and several foreign countries. Although Thailand and Korea are on that list, Panama is not. See DoD List of Locations Where Tactical Herbicides and Their Chemical Components Were Tested, Used or Stored Outside of Vietnam, https://www.publichealth.va.gov/docs/agentorange/dod_herbicides_outside_vietnam.pdf# (verifying herbicide agent use by the U.S. military in the foreign countries of: Cambodia, Canada, India, Johnston Atoll, Korea, Laos, and Thailand). 

In sum, the Veteran did not serve in Vietnam, Korea, or Thailand which entitled him to the presumption of herbicide agent exposure. The Veteran's confirmed 1975-1977 service in Panama does not entitle him to a presumption of herbicide agent exposure, despite him being incorrectly identified as such during his 2015 Agent Orange Examination. Therefore, it follows that the persuasive weight of the evidence of record is against a finding of the Veteran's exposure to herbicide agents during service.

The Board acknowledges the June 2023 private medical opinion of record in which the Veteran's VA care provider opined that because the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents "while on active duty in Panama," he should be presumptively service-connected for his diabetes disability based on this herbicide agent exposure. See also 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). Although the Board acknowledges the Veteran's treating care provider is often a highly probative source, their opinion here is based on the assumption that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents during his Panama service due to VA incorrectly adding him to the Agent Orange registry. The Veteran's Panama herbicide agent exposure is also not clearly verified by the Veteran's lay testimony, as he concluded his exposure must have occurred in Panama after incorrectly being identified for the Agent Orange registry. See December 2022 Lay Statement ("While in the dense jungle we were never told of any chemicals used there. . . . One day when I was in Charleston, SC (VA Hospital) I went to get a test done on me [and] found out that I have di[o]x[i]n [exposure]."). Therefore, the Board affords this opinion no probative weight.

The Veteran was not afforded a VA medical opinion; however, one was not required for this claim. The record does not indicate an association between any symptoms that may be related to the Veteran's diabetes disability and his Panama service. Thus, a VA medical opinion is not required. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). See also Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278-79 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (a conclusory generalized lay statement alleging nexus between a current disability and service does not meet the standard to warrant a VA examination).

The Board finds the persuasive weight of the evidence is against a finding of service connection for the Veteran's type II diabetes mellitus disability. For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether service connection; rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against service connection. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Therefore, entitlement to service connection for type II diabetes mellitus is denied.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.
