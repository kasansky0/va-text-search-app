DOCKET NO. 250113-501121
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

The appeal as to whether the Appellant's May 2024 claim for service connection of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in a January 31, 2019, decision was timely filed is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The May 2024 claim was filed over one year after the date of the Veteran's May 2012 death. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for filing a timely claim for accrued benefits have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5121A; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000, 3.1010.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1969 to March 1971. The Veteran died in May 2012. The Appellant is the surviving spouse of the Veteran. This case is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2, 2024, letter from the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In May 2024, the Appellant's representative filed a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application seeking accrued benefits for service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alleging clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the January 31, 2019, statement of the case (SOC). 

On July 2, 2024, the AOJ sent a letter to the Appellant and her attorney stating that the claim for accrued benefits was not received within one year of the Veteran's death and so was untimely. 

In January 2025, the Appellant selected the Direct Review docket when she submitted a VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), appealing the July 2024 letter decision. Under the Direct Review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2601, 20.302. No additional evidence has been added to the record.

The Board notes that it may not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting a docket switch has elapsed. Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).?However, this appeal has been advanced on the docket due to the Appellant's terminal illness. In the motion, the attorney requested the appeal be advanced "at the earliest time possible" and the Board finds this constitutes a waiver of the ability to request a docket switch.

Accrued benefits are periodic monetary benefits (other than insurance and servicemen's indemnity) to which an individual was entitled at death under existing ratings or decisions and under laws administered by the VA Secretary, or those based on evidence in the file at date of death and due and unpaid, that shall, upon the death of such individual, be paid to the surviving spouse or other appropriate party. 38 U.S.C. §5121; 38 C.F.R. §3.1000.

While an accrued benefits claim is separate from a veteran's claim filed prior to death, the accrued benefits claim is derivative of the veteran's claim; thus, an appellant takes the veteran's claim as it stood on the date of death, but within the limits established by law. Zevalkink v. Brown, 102 F.3d 1236, 1242 (Fed. Cir. 1996). For entitlement to accrued benefits, the veteran must have had a claim pending at the time of his death for such benefits or else be entitled to them under an existing rating or decision. See Jones v. West, 136 F.3d 1296, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Taylor v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 126, 128-29 (2007). Among the requirements for accrued benefits is that the claim be filed within one year after the date of death of the individual with respect to whom such benefits are sought. 38 U.S.C. §5121(c); 38C.F.R. §3.1000(c).

A beneficiary eligible for accrued benefits may request to be substituted to pursue a pending claim by the Veteran under 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010.  Proceeding as a substitute allows an Appellant to substitute permits the Appellant to add to the evidence of record.

Key to both forms of payment is that the Appellant must be pursuing an already pending claim for benefits. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1000, 3.1010. 

The Appellant is seeking accrued benefits for service connection for PTSD. 

By way of background, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for PTSD prior to his death. The claim was denied and the Veteran timely appealed. The Board remanded the matter in September 2011. While the claim was in remand status, the Veteran died. The Appellant was properly substituted to pursue the claim, and all other claims the Veteran had pending at the time of his death. The Board remanded the claim for service connection for PTSD several times, most recently in June 2018 to obtain a statement of the case (SOC), which had never been issued previously. The remand instruction stated the issue would only be certified to the Board if a timely substantive appeal was received after the issuance of the SOC. 

An SOC was issued on January 31, 2019, and was informed the substantive appeal (Form 9) must be filed within 60 days from the date of the notice letter, or within the remainder, if any, of the one year from the date of the letter notifying the claimant of the initial decision appealed. The 60 days set the applicable deadline, as the initial decision on appeal was issued in August 2009. 

The Appellant, through her representative, filed a Form 9 Appeal to the Board on April 3, 2019, via fax. Unfortunately, the 60 day period expired on Monday, April 1, 2019. The AOJ informed her in an April 12, 2022, letter that her appeal was untimely. No other action was taken by the Appellant, and the decision is final. 

As of the date of this decision, the Appellant had been properly substituted in all claims that were pending at the time of the Veteran's death, and those claims have been pursued to finality.

In May 2024, the Appellant filed a new claim for accrued benefits seeking to establish service connection for PTSD, arguing that there was CUE in a January 31, 2019, decision (the SOC). The AOJ informed her that the claim was filed untimely, and Appellant appealed the decision of untimeliness. Such a claim had to have been filed within a year of the Veteran's death, as the Appellant had previously done. The Appellant is barred from filing a claim for accrued benefits after a year from the date of the Veteran's death. This is not an instance in which the Appellant is pursuing a claim already pending; she is attempting to resurrect a final determination or expand a claim, which are specifically barred by the regulation.  As the May 2024 claim was filed over a decade after the Veteran's death, it is untimely. Thus, the Appellant's appeal is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5121(c); 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000(c).
