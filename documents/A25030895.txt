ORDER

The appeal pertaining to a finding of a duty to assist error during the higher-level review for service connection of a mental health disorder, to include depression, stress, and insomnia, is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The finding of a duty to assist error was not an adverse action; therefore, it was not appealable.

2. There is no VA Form 10182 submitted corresponding to any issue that has not already been adjudicated. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria have been met for dismissal of the appeal pertaining to a finding of a duty to assist error during the higher-level review for service connection of a mental health disorder to include depression, stress and insomnia.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 2001 to December 2002 and from April 2005 to November 2006. See January 2003 Form DD 214; see also October 2023 Form DD 214. 

VA regulations provide that a Notice of Disagreement must identify specific decisions and issue or issues therein with which a claimant disagrees. The term issue means an adjudication of a specific entitlement as described in §3.151(c). 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a). 

In June 2021, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement). The issue docketed as being on appeal has been characterized as "insomnia." However, the Veteran is appealing the determination pertaining to a duty to assist error being found during the development of an issue pertaining to the service connection of the Veteran's mental health disorder to include depression, stress and insomnia. 

In the August 2020 Higher Level Review decision, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) identified a duty to assist error, which was failure to obtain a new examination and medical opinion. This was in response to the Veteran's request for a Higher Level Review submitted in April 2020.  The Veteran requested a review of the March 2020 rating decision, in which the AOJ confirmed and continued a previous denial of service connection for mental health conditions (to include depression, stress and insomnia). Furthermore, a review of the record shows that there has been no VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) pertaining to appealing the March 2020 decision. Nonetheless, the finding of a duty to assist error as to service connection of a mental health disorder (to include depression, stress and insomnia) was not an adverse action and therefore not appealable. 

Furthermore, a review of the record reveals that the issue that the Veteran has appealed (mental health disorder to include depression, stress and insomnia) has been adjudicated by the AOJ in multiple rating decisions ( October 2020,  November 2020), and the Board granted service connection for major depressive disorder (previously claimed as a mental disorder to include depression, stress and insomnia) in October 2021.

Currently, as the record stands, there are no pending valid issues before the Board. As there is no question of fact or law, the appeal is dismissed.
