ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral foot conditions is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's bilateral foot conditions are etiologically related to service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bilateral foot conditions have not been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303, 3.304.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1988 to April 1989.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2024 Higher-Level Review rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a December 2023 decision.  In June 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior December 2023 decision.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 AOJ decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

As noted, the Veteran selected the Direct Review docket.  Pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2), an appellant may modify a Notice of Disagreement to change the Board docket being requested.  The time limit for such modification is within one year from the date the notification of the decision on appeal is sent or within 60 days of the date that the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement, whichever is later.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  The Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2).  See Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024).

Here, as the claim is granted, the Board finds that proceeding is not prejudicial to the Veteran.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304.  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Generally, establishing service connection requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999).  Additionally, a showing of continuity of symptoms from separation to the present is a factor to be considered in assessing service connection claims.

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral foot conditions.

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral foot conditions, including bilateral foot pain / metatarsalgia, bilateral hallux valgus deformity, and right foot hammer toe (due to hallux valgus), and contending she experienced pain during boot camp which worsened while performing her duties as a food service specialist.  Specifically, wearing her military boots, her duties of lifting and carrying heavy items, and constantly be on her feet caused her foot pain.  Alternatively, she contends her pre-existing hallux valgus was aggravated by service due to her duties as a food service specialist.

As an initial matter, the Veteran was diagnosed with bilateral foot pain / metatarsalgia, bilateral hallux valgus deformity, and right foot hammer toe (due to hallux valgus) by her treating physician. The first element of service connection has been established.

Concerning the second element, the Board acknowledges the Veteran reported pain while in service in the performance of her duties and finds her statement credible.

Regarding the final element, here the evidence establishes a nexus between active duty and her bilateral foot conditions.  The Veteran submitted an October 2023 private opinion from her treating physician who opined that her bilateral foot conditions to include bilateral metatarsalgia and hallux valgus deformities were caused as a result of her military service.

The Board finds the private opinion adequate and afforded it high probative value as the physician supported the conclusion based on years of treating her conditions, familiarity with her medical history, expertise in the practice area, diagnostic imaging, the clinical presentation of her foot conditions, and a review of her military treatment records.

In arriving at this conclusion, the Board acknowledges a negative September 2022 VA opinion.  However, the Board finds the September 2022 opinion inadequate and affords it limited probative value as the examiner found the Veteran's hallux valgus pre-existed service and appears to have not considered her lay statements concerning ongoing pain.

The Board finds the weight of the evidence supports the Veteran's bilateral foot conditions are etiologically related to service.  Therefore, the Board finds service connection is warranted.  The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided.  This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability.  38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
