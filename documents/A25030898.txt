ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a right ear hearing loss disability to an extent recognized as a disability for VA purposes at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's left ear hearing loss disability began during active service, manifested within a year of separation from service, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

3. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's tinnitus disability began during active service, manifested within a year of separation from service, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for hearing loss are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.385.

2. The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1986 to March 1987 and from December 1990 to May 1991 with additional service in the Reserves.

In November 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of service connection for hearing loss, tinnitus, right knee, right shoulder, and right elbow disabilities, previously decided in earlier rating decisions.  In January 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claims based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the right knee, right shoulder, and right elbow claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record.  See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).

Service Connection

Generally, service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases, such as sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus, will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Regarding service connection claims for hearing loss, the Board notes that this particular disability is defined by regulation.  Specifically, under the laws administered by VA, impaired hearing will be considered to be a disability when the auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz is 40 decibels or greater; when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the above frequencies are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  

Additionally, the Board observes that precedential case law provides that the threshold for normal hearing is between 0 and 20 decibels and that higher thresholds show some degree of hearing loss.  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993).

The absence of in-service evidence of hearing loss is not fatal to a claim for service connection.  Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992).  Evidence of a current hearing loss disability (i.e., one meeting the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, as noted above) and a medically sound basis for attributing such disability to service may serve as a basis for a grant of service connection for hearing loss.  Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. at 159.  Moreover, to establish service connection for sensorineural hearing loss, a veteran is not obligated to show that his hearing loss was present during active service.  However, if there is insufficient evidence to establish that a claimed chronic disability was present during service or during the one-year presumptive period thereafter, the evidence must establish a nexus between his current disability and his in-service exposure to loud noise.  Godfrey v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 352 (1992).

In rendering this decision, the Board has reviewed all evidence of record whether discussed in detail.  See Newhouse v. Nicholson, 497 F.3d 1298, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding the Board must only discuss the evidence which is relevant to the issues on appeal). 

To the extent the evidence is found in "approximate balance," the Board will afford the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed, Cir. 2021) (holding that exact equipoise is not required for the benefit of the doubt to be applied, but rather the Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt when the evidence is in approximate balance or "nearly equal").

1. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for hearing loss and tinnitus, asserting that such disabilities are related to in-service noise exposure.

The January 2023 rating decision on appeal included favorable findings that the Veteran has current left ear hearing loss and tinnitus disabilities and that there was in-service acoustic trauma from the Veteran's service as cannon fire direction specialist.  Therefore, the questions left for the Board are whether the Veteran has current right ear hearing loss meeting VA disability requirements and whether any current hearing loss and tinnitus disabilities are related to service, to include from the conceded in-service noise exposure.

Turning to the evidence, in his April 1986 entrance examination, the Veteran's pure tone thresholds for the right ear were 5, 0, 0, 5, 10, and 20, and for the left ear were 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, and 15 decibels at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hertz, respectively.  

In an undated retention examination, the Veteran's pure tone thresholds for the right ear were 10, 10, 5, 15, 15, and 20, and for the left ear were 15, 10, 0, 10, 20, and 10 decibels at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hertz, respectively.  

In his November 1990 report of medical history upon entry into his second period of active service, the Veteran reported "no" to hearing loss and to ear, nose, or throat trouble.  The November 1990 examination for entrance into his second period of active service notes that the Veteran's ears are normal.

In his April 1991 report of medical history at separation, the Veteran reported "no" to hearing loss and to ear, nose, or throat trouble.  In his April 1991 separation examination, the Veteran's pure tone thresholds for the right ear were 5, 5, 0, 5, 10, and 20, and for the left ear were 5, 0, 0, 10, 20, and 10 decibels at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 6000 Hertz, respectively.  The examiner noted the Veteran's ears were normal on examination.

The Veteran filed his original claim for service connection for hearing loss and tinnitus in November 2016.

In a November 2016 statement, the Veteran reported that he was exposed to loud noises as part of the field artillery unit during service.  He reported that he now suffered from ringing and hearing loss in his ears.

The Veteran underwent VA examination in December 2016.  During his examination, the Veteran's pure tone thresholds for the right ear were 20, 20, 25, 25, and 30 decibels at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz, respectively.  Speech discrimination score, using the Maryland CNC word list, was 94 percent for the right ear.  

The December 2016 examiner opined that the Veteran's left ear hearing loss was not at least as likely as not caused by service.  The examiner explained that the Veteran had normal hearing for all frequencies at separation in April 1991 with no decrease in hearing compared to the November 1990 audiogram.

The examiner also opined that the Veteran's tinnitus was less likely than not caused by in-service noise exposure.  The examiner explained that there was no link to the Veteran's time in service.  The examiner noted the Veteran reported that he first noticed the tinnitus the prior year but that it had gotten worse in the last 5-6 months.

In a February 2017 statement, the Veteran asserted that his hearing was damaged from Howitzer shooting rounds.

A September 2017 private audiogram appears to show the Veteran's thresholds for the right ear were 45, 35, 40, 40, and 45 decibels at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz, respectively.  

A December 2017 private audiogram submitted by the Veteran does not list the decibels for each frequency in numbers but does not appear to show right ear hearing loss meeting VA standards from application of the key to the chart; mild bilateral hearing loss was noted by the examiner.  

The Veteran filed a supplemental claim in November 2021.

The Veteran underwent VA contract examination March 2022.  During the examination, the Veteran reported that he began experiencing tinnitus 7-8 years prior and that he had post-service occupational noise exposure as a result of security work.  During his examination, the Veteran's pure tone thresholds for the right ear were 20, 20, 25, 25, and 25 decibels at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz, respectively.  Speech discrimination score, using the Maryland CNC word list, was 94 percent for the right ear.  

For the Veteran's left ear, the examiner opined that the Veteran's left ear hearing loss was not at least as likely as not a result of service.  The examiner explained that there was no significant permanent shift in hearing thresholds beyond test variability from entrance to separation, which was objective evidence of no permanent auditory damage on active duty from the conceded noise exposure.  The examiner noted that there was no report of complaint or treatment for hearing decrease in the Veteran's service treatment records or at separation.  The examiner explained that although noise exposure was conceded and the relationship of noise, auditory damage, and hearing loss is well-established, auditory damage and hearing loss are not established based on noise alone.  The examiner noted there must be a nexus of auditory damage to relate the current hearing loss to military noise exposure rather than another etiology.  Here, the examiner explained, the evidence was against a nexus between the Veteran's military noise exposure and his current hearing loss.  

For the Veteran's tinnitus, the examiner opined that the tinnitus is less likely than not a result of in-service noise exposure.  The examiner explained that the onset of tinnitus was reported by the Veteran to be post-separation.  The examiner further noted that there was no report of tinnitus in the Veteran's service treatment records, at separation, or in the medical records until the Veteran filed a claim.  The examiner noted that current literature does not support late onset noise-induced tinnitus.  The examiner further noted that the Veteran's tinnitus was at least as likely as not a symptom associated with his hearing loss.

Right Ear Hearing Loss

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a right ear hearing loss disability to an extent recognized as a disability for VA purposes at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.  Therefore, the first element of service connection for right ear hearing loss has not been met.

Viewing the evidence as a whole, the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding of a current right ear hearing loss disability meeting the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 at any time during the claims period or approximate to the pendency of the claim.  The Veteran's March 2022 VA examination audiogram reflecting testing of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz does not show any auditory thresholds for the right ear of 40 decibels or greater, 26 or greater in three of those thresholds, or Maryland CNC speech discrimination scores of less than 94 percent.  The March 2022 VA examination audiogram is the only audiogram in the claims file that was taken during the claims period (since the November 2021 supplemental claim was filed) and it shows that the Veteran does not have a right ear hearing loss disability meeting VA requirements.  Although the September 2017 private audiogram appears to show right ear hearing loss at levels considered a disability for VA purposes, the audiogram was conducted more than four years prior to the filing of the claim.  The presence of this single audiogram showing hearing loss for VA purposes from a time period more than four years prior to the claims period is not sufficient to show right ear hearing loss during the claims period, or approximate to the claims period, when the only audiogram during the claims period showed that the Veteran did not have such right ear hearing loss disability.

The Board must adhere to the guidelines of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, which do not provide for a finding of a current disability if pure tone thresholds or speech recognition scores fail to meet the required minimum thresholds.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's reports of problems hearing and the diagnosis of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss in the claims file.  While the Veteran is considered competent to report problems hearing, he does not have the medical expertise and/or training to competently state that his decreased hearing acuity at this time meets the criteria for a hearing loss disability for VA purposes under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

Accordingly, the Board finds the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding of a current right ear hearing loss disability meeting VA criteria under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.  As the current disability requirement is not met for the Veteran's right ear hearing loss claim, the claim of service connection for right ear hearing loss must be denied at this time based on the evidence of record.

Left Ear Hearing Loss

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's left ear hearing loss disability began during active service, manifested within a year of separation from service, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.  Therefore, the nexus element of service connection for left ear hearing loss has not been met.

Viewing the evidence as a whole, the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's left ear hearing loss disability began during active service, manifested within a year of separation from service, or is otherwise related to service.  The Veteran's in-service audiograms, including his April 1991 separation audiogram, do not show left ear hearing loss meeting VA requirements.  Indeed, the audiograms do not even show any thresholds over 20 decibels.  See Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993).  The April 1991 examiner at separation noted the Veteran's ears were normal.  Moreover, the Veteran denied experiencing any hearing loss or ear, nose, or throat trouble in November 1990 and again at separation from service in April 1991.  The first indication of hearing problems in the claims file was with the Veteran's original November 2016 claim for service connection, more than 25 years after service.  The Veteran has never asserted that his hearing problems began during service or within the year following service.  Both the December 2016 and March 2022 VA examiners opined that the Veteran's left ear hearing loss was not at least as likely as not caused by service.  The examiners explained that there was no decrease in hearing during service.  The March 2022 VA examiner specifically noted the Veteran's in-service noise exposure from working as a cannon fire direction specialist and his post-service occupational noise exposure.  The March 2022 examiner explained that there was no significant permanent shift in hearing thresholds beyond test variability from entrance to separation, which was objective evidence of no permanent auditory damage on active duty from the conceded noise exposure.  The examiner also noted that there was no report of complaint or treatment for hearing decrease during service.  Finally, the March 2022 examiner explained that although noise exposure was conceded and the relationship of noise, auditory damage, and hearing loss is well-established, auditory damage and hearing loss are not established based on noise alone and that here the evidence was against a nexus between the Veteran's military noise exposure and his current hearing loss.  The Board finds the March 2022 examiner's opinion probative, as it is based upon the medical evidence and supporting explanation was provided.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  There is no contrary medical opinion in the claims file.

To the extent that the Veteran asserts that his left ear hearing loss disability is related to service, he is not competent to provide such an opinion.  The issue is medically complex and is therefore outside the competence of the Veteran in this case as the record does not show that the Veteran has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011).  

Accordingly, the Board finds the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's left ear hearing loss disability began during active service, manifested within a year of separation from service, or is otherwise related to service.  As the nexus requirement for service connection is not met for the Veteran's left ear hearing loss claim, the claim of service connection for left ear hearing loss must be denied at this time based on the evidence of record.

Tinnitus 

The Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's tinnitus disability began during active service, manifested within a year of separation from service, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.  Therefore, the nexus element of service connection for tinnitus has not been met.

Viewing the evidence as a whole, the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's tinnitus disability began during active service, manifested within a year of separation from service, or is otherwise related to service, to include the Veteran's in-service noise exposure.  The Veteran denied any ear trouble in November 1990 and again at separation from service in April 1991.  His April 1991 separation examination noted that his ears were normal.  The Veteran has never asserted that his tinnitus began during service or within the year following service.  Rather, in his VA examinations, he reported that his tinnitus began more than 20 years after service (sometime around 2014-2016).  Both the December 2016 and March 2022 VA examiners opined that the Veteran's current tinnitus disability was less likely than not caused by his in-service noise exposure.  The December 2016 VA examiner explained that there was no link to the Veteran's time in service.  The March 2022 examiner explained that the onset of tinnitus was reported by the Veteran to be post-separation, that there was no report of tinnitus in the Veteran's service treatment records, at separation, or in the medical records until the Veteran filed a claim, and that current medical literature does not support late onset noise-induced tinnitus.  The examiner also noted that the Veteran's tinnitus was at least as likely as not a symptom associated with his hearing loss, which was not related to his in-service noise exposure for the reasons discussed above.  The Board finds the March 2022 examiner's opinion probative, as it is based upon the medical evidence and supporting explanation was provided.  Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).  There is no contrary medical opinion in the claims file.

To the extent that the Veteran asserts that his current tinnitus disability is related to service, he is not competent to provide such an opinion.  The issue is medically complex and is therefore outside the competence of the Veteran in this case as the record does not show that the Veteran has the medical training or credentials to make such a determination.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011).  

Accordingly, the Board finds the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's tinnitus disability began during active service, manifested within a year of separation from service, or is otherwise related to service.  As the nexus requirement for service connection is not met for the Veteran's tinnitus claim, the claim of service connection for tinnitus must be denied at this time based on the evidence of record.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for right knee disability is remanded.

2. Entitlement to service connection for right shoulder disability is remanded.

The Veteran's claims for service connection for right knee and right shoulder disability must be remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the January 2023 rating decision, in not obtaining adequate medical opinion regarding whether the Veteran's right knee and right shoulder disabilities had an onset in service or are otherwise related to service.

Although VA medical opinions were obtained regarding the right knee (in February 2011) and the right shoulder (in December 2012), the VA medical opinions relied on the lack of chronicity/ continuity of symptoms following the right shoulder and right knee complaints during service.  As a result, the examiners opined that they were unable to find or define a nexus between the in-service complaints and present disability.

A March 2016 private examiner noted the Veteran's in-service right shoulder and right knee injuries and explained that the Veteran has had recurrent flare-ups with pain and a limp with continued intermittent pain and swelling over the following 20 years.  The examiner explained that the Veteran's history suggested an onset of chronic problems in service and that the Veteran still walked with a limp.  However, the examiner then provided a speculative opinion that the condition "could have" begun in service but that the Veteran had a long work history since that time.  

The medical opinions in the claims file at the time of the rating decision on appeal were inadequate to decide the Veteran's right knee and right shoulder disability claims.  The VA examiners relied on the lack of chronicity of symptomatology but did not have the opportunity to consider the later private opinion which raised ambiguity regarding whether there was indeed evidence of continuity of symptomatology since service, including chronic problems with a limp.  Although the later private opinion raised ambiguity, the opinion is not sufficient to grant the Veteran's claims as it is speculative - explaining that the Veteran's current right knee and right shoulder disability "could have" begun in service but that the Veteran also had a long work history after service.  The March 2016 private opinion and other private opinions in the claims file are not sufficient to grant the Veteran's claims as they are speculative or lack adequate rationale.  As there is not an adequate medical opinion in the claims file addressing the Veteran's in-service injury and subsequent symptomatology, remand is warranted to obtain additional VA medical opinion and correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error.

3. Entitlement to service connection for right elbow disability is remanded.

The Veteran's claim for service connection for right elbow disability must be remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the January 2023 rating decision, in not obtaining VA medical opinion regarding whether the Veteran's right elbow disability is related to service.

The Veteran seeks service connection for right elbow disability and has diagnoses including right elbow tendonitis.  During private treatment, the Veteran reported that he hurt his right elbow at the same time he injured his right shoulder during basic training in service in the 1980s.  See July 2012 Private Treatment Record.  He also reported that his right elbow problems stem from overuse of the elbow following his right shoulder injury during service.  See August 2012 Private Treatment Record.  No VA examiner has addressed whether the Veteran's current right elbow disability began during service or is otherwise related to service, to include his right shoulder injury and boot camp activities during service.  Accordingly, as the Veteran has raised the contention that his current right elbow disability is directly due to service, remand is warranted to obtain VA medical opinion and correct this pre-decisional duty to assist error.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006).  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Ask an appropriate examiner to review the Veteran's file.  The necessity of an in-person examination is left to the discretion of the examiner.

The examiner should opine as to the following:

-	Identify any and all disabilities found of the right knee, right shoulder, and elbow. 

NOTE:  For VA purposes, "pain" without a specific diagnosis can be a disability if such pain causes functional impairment of earning capacity.

-	For each such disability identified (to include "pain" causing functional impairment of earning capacity), opine whether the disability at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher): (a) had an onset in service; or (b) is related to service.

The examiner should consider all relevant medical and lay evidence of record, including the December 1986 service treatment record showing right shoulder complaints, the February 1991 service treatment records noting right knee contusion from trailer injury with restricted duty and the Veteran favoring his right leg, the Veteran's report that he hurt his right elbow at the same time he injured his right shoulder during basic training, the Veteran's assertion that his right elbow problems stem from overuse of the elbow following his right shoulder injury during service, the Veteran's report of pain following push-ups, reaching, front leaning, and carrying packs during long marches in service, the Veteran's report of still experiencing right knee pain at separation in April 1991, the Veteran's current reports of symptoms since service, February 2013 statements from the Veteran's friends, and the March 2016 private medical opinion.

If the Veteran's reports are discounted, the examiner should provide a rationale for doing so (e.g., whether there is any medical reason to accept or reject his contentions).

The examiner is asked to explain the reasons behind any opinions expressed.

2. After the above development, and any other development deemed necessary, readjudicate the claims.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
