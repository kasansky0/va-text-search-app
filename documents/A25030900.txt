FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for a right arm condition was received on June 24, 2022, more than one year after the Veteran's separation from active duty service.

2. The Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for loss of use, liberally construed as a claim of entitlement to service connection for right lower extremity muscle weakness associated with multiple sclerosis, was received on June 24, 2022, more than one year after the Veteran's separation from active duty service.

3. The Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for loss of use, liberally construed as a claim of entitlement to service connection for voiding dysfunction associated with multiple sclerosis, was received on June 24, 2022, more than one year after the Veteran's separation from active duty service.

4. The Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for loss of use, liberally construed as a claim of entitlement to service connection for erectile dysfunction associated with multiple sclerosis, was received on June 24, 2022, more than one year after the Veteran's separation from active duty service.

5. The effective date of the award of SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ must coincide with the effective date of the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction.

6. A formal claim of entitlement to service connection for an eye disability was received on April 22, 2017.

7. On December 13, 2017, the RO notified the Veteran that service connection for an eye disability was denied, as the evidence failed to show ocular diagnoses other than for astigmatism and myopia.

8. By a November 2018 rating decision, the RO continued its denial of the claim of entitlement to service connection for vision and visual impairment on the basis that the Veteran's astigmatism and myopia were considered congenital or developmental defects and were neither incurred in nor aggravated by military service.  The Veteran did not file a notice of disagreement or submit new and material evidence within the applicable appeal period, and as such, the November 2018 rating decision became final.

9. Prior to June 24, 2022, the Veteran had a single disability rated as 100 percent disabling; however, he did not have additional separate and distinct service-connected disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, nor was he housebound due to his service-connected disabilities.

10. The claim of entitlement to an effective date earlier than April 21, 2017, for the award of a 10 percent disability rating for right index finger crush tip injury is a freestanding earlier effective date claim; the Veteran has not contended that the rating decision that initially awarded service connection and assigned an effective date for right index finger crush tip injury was the product of clear and unmistakable error (CUE).

11. The Veteran's right upper extremity muscle weakness associated with multiple sclerosis is manifest by no more than moderate incomplete paralysis of the major extremity.

12. The Veteran's right lower extremity muscle weakness associated with multiple sclerosis is manifest by no more than mild incomplete paralysis.

13. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran experienced dull and intermittent pain of his right sciatic nerve.

14. The Veteran's voiding dysfunction has been manifested by urinary frequency with daytime voiding interval between two and three hours.

15. The Veteran's erectile dysfunction is not shown to have been manifested by a disease or traumatic injury of the penis resulting in scarring or deformity.

16. The Veteran is in receipt of the maximum schedular rating for right index finger crush tip injury; there is no available alternative Diagnostic Code (DC) that indicates any potential entitlement to a higher rating.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 2010 to June 2013.  During his period of service, he earned the Army Commendation Medal (Second Award), Meritorious Unit Commendation, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. Iraq Campaign Medal with campaign Star, Noncommissioned Officer Professional Development Ribbon, Army Service Ribbon, and Overseas Service Ribbon.

In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the November 2022 rating decision.  In October 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior November 2022 rating decision.  

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to a noncompensable disability rating for diplopia associated with multiple sclerosis, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Earlier Effective Date

Generally, the effective date of an award of disability compensation based on an original claim shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  If the claim for service connection is received within one year of a veteran's discharge from service, the effective date of an award of service connection will be the day following discharge from service.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2); see also Wright v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 343, 347 (1997) (holding that § 5110(b)(1) "applies only to those awards of disability compensation actually based on a claim filed within one year after the veteran's separation").  Otherwise, the effective date will be the later of the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

The effective date assigned for a secondarily service-connected disability does not relate back to the filing date of a prior claim for the antecedent disability.  Ellington v. Nicholson, 22 Vet. App. 141 (2007).  The effective date assigned for a secondary service-connected condition does not have to be the same as the effective date for the underlying condition.  Ross v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 528 (2008).  The plain meaning of 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a) is and has always been to require VA to afford secondarily service-connected conditions the same treatment (no more or less favorable treatment) as the underlying service-connected conditions for all determinations.  Roper v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 173, 181 (2006).  This includes the assignment of an effective date.  Accordingly, as with any other claim, the effective date assigned for a secondarily service-connected condition is governed by § 3.400.  The governing regulations dictate that the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later, and the Board is bound by that authority.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

According to Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997), in the case of claims for earlier effective dates for awards of increased compensation, three possible effective dates may be assigned: (1) if an increase in disability occurs after the claim is filed, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (the date entitlement arose) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1)); (2) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (i.e., the date the increase is factually ascertainable) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2)); or (3) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by more than a year, the date that the claim is received (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2)).

The Board is mindful that the "identification of the benefit sought" requirement does not necessitate technical precision.  See Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 256-57 (2007).  A claimant may identify the benefit sought by referring to a body part or system that is disabled or by describing symptoms of the disability.  Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 86-87 (2009).  However, VA is obligated to consider only claims that may be "reasonably encompassed by several factors including: the claimant's description of the claim; the symptoms the claimant describes; and the information the claimant submits or that the Secretary obtains in support of the claim."  See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014), codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155.  The amended regulations apply to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.  Because the Veteran's claim was received by VA after March 24, 2015, the new regulations apply.

1. Entitlement to an effective date for the award of service connection for right upper extremity muscle weakness associated with multiple sclerosis

2. Entitlement to an effective date for the award of service connection for right lower extremity muscle weakness associated with multiple sclerosis

3. Entitlement to an effective date for the award of service connection for voiding dysfunction associated with multiple sclerosis

4. Entitlement to an effective date for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction associated with multiple sclerosis

5. Entitlement to an effective date for the award of special monthly compensation based on loss of use of a creative organ

The Veteran submitted a claim of entitlement to service connection for a right arm condition, loss of use, and voiding dysfunction on June 24, 2022.  The Board notes that the Veteran did not specifically identify a right lower extremity disability, voiding dysfunction, or erectile dysfunction as claimed conditions; however, due to his lay assertions of the right side of his body being affected and inability to hold his urine, the Board will liberally construe his claim for compensation to include claims of entitlement to service connection for a right lower extremity disability, voiding dysfunction, and erectile dysfunction.  See Robinson v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1355, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009); Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009).

By an October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for right upper extremity muscle weakness, right lower extremity muscle weakness, voiding dysfunction, and erectile dysfunction associated with multiple sclerosis, effective June 24, 2022, the date on which the Veteran's claim was received.  In January 2024, the Veteran filed a notice of disagreement and perfected an appeal as to the assigned effective date.

The Veteran has not stated what effective date he believes to be appropriate for the award of service connection for right upper extremity muscle weakness, right lower extremity muscle weakness, voiding dysfunction, and erectile dysfunction associated with multiple sclerosis.

Here, the Board must apply the statutory and regulatory guidelines for determining the effective date of an award of disability compensation as set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5110, which essentially provides that the effective date of an award of compensation will be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).  Thus, what is material in this case is when the records show that the claims of entitlement to service connection for right upper extremity muscle weakness, right lower extremity muscle weakness, voiding dysfunction, and erectile dysfunction associated with multiple sclerosis were filed, despite the fact that the Veteran may have been diagnosed and treated for the disability at an earlier time point.

Upon a review of the record, the Board finds the appropriate effective date for the award of service connection for right upper extremity muscle weakness, right lower extremity muscle weakness, voiding dysfunction, and erectile dysfunction associated with multiple sclerosis is June 24, 2022, the date the claim of entitlement to service connection was received.

The Board has reviewed the entire claims file, including the Veteran's submissions to VA prior to June 24, 2022.  None of his correspondence discusses right upper extremity muscle weakness, right lower extremity muscle weakness, voiding dysfunction, and erectile dysfunction or suggests that he was filing claims for right upper extremity muscle weakness, right lower extremity muscle weakness, voiding dysfunction, and erectile dysfunction.  There is no mention of a right upper extremity disability, right lower extremity disability, voiding dysfunction, or erectile dysfunction when filing his earlier claims or when he received rating decisions prior to October 2023 that failed to address a right upper extremity disability, right lower extremity disability, voiding dysfunction, or erectile dysfunction.  To the extent that the Veteran may have experienced right upper extremity muscle weakness, right lower extremity muscle weakness, voiding dysfunction, and erectile dysfunction prior to June 2022, there is no provision in the law for awarding an earlier effective date based simply on the presence of the disability.  See Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 35 (1998) (the mere presence of medical evidence of a condition does not establish an intent on the part of the veteran to seek service connection for the disability).

As noted above, the law provides that the effective date of a claim filed more than one year from discharge is the later of the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  In this case, the Veteran did not file a claim of entitlement to service connection for right upper extremity muscle weakness, right lower extremity muscle weakness, voiding dysfunction, and erectile dysfunction within one year following discharge, and he has been granted service connection effective the date of VA's receipt of his claim.  This is the earliest effective date allowed by law and there is simply no evidence or argument to support an effective date for the award of service connection prior to June 24, 2022.

Accordingly, in light of the probative evidence of record, the Board finds that an earlier effective date than June 24, 2022, is not warranted for the award of service connection for right upper extremity muscle weakness, right lower extremity muscle weakness, voiding dysfunction, and erectile dysfunction associated with multiple sclerosis.

Finally, an earlier effective date claim for SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ is essentially a claim for an increased rating or other compensation.  SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ is assigned based on the date of the grant of service connection for erectile dysfunction.  As discussed above, an effective date prior to June 24, 2022, for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction cannot be granted.  The Veteran therefore cannot receive SMC prior to the date of the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction and the claim must be denied.

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. However, as the evidence weighs persuasively against the Veteran's claims of entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 24, 2022, for the award of service connection for right upper extremity muscle weakness, right lower extremity muscle weakness, voiding dysfunction, and erectile dysfunction associated with multiple sclerosis, that doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

6. Entitlement to an effective date for the award of service connection for diplopia associated with multiple sclerosis

The Veteran filed a claim of entitlement to service connection for an eye disability on April 22, 2017.  The AOJ denied the Veteran's claim by a December 2017 rating decision.  The Veteran was informed of the decision and his appellate rights by a December 2017 letter.  Thereafter, the Veteran filed an application to reopen his claim of entitlement to service connection for vision and visual impairment in September 2018.  See VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (Compensation), received September 26, 2018.  The previous denial of service connection for vision and visual impairment was continued by a November 2018 rating decision.  The Veteran was informed of the decision and his appellate rights by a November 2018 letter.  He did not file a notice of disagreement and no additional evidence pertinent to the issue was physically or constructively associated with the claims folder within one year of that decision.  Thus, the November 2018 rating decision became final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

An application to reopen his claim of entitlement to service connection for a right eye condition on June 24, 2022.  By an October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ awarded service connection for diplopia associated with multiple sclerosis effective June 24, 2022, the date in which the Veteran's request to reopen the claim of entitlement to service connection was received.

Upon a review of the record, the Board finds the appropriate effective date for the award of service connection for an eye disability is June 24, 2022, the date the claim to reopen the previously denied claim of entitlement to service connection for was received.

Generally, when granting entitlement to service connection for a disability in response to an application to reopen a claim that had previously been denied, VA cannot assign an effective date earlier than the date of receipt of the application to reopen.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(r) (effective date of reopened claim is date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later); Comer v. Peake, 552 F.3d 1362, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2009) ("The earliest effective date for an award based on a veteran's request to reopen a final decision based on new and material evidence is generally the date that the application to reopen was filed").

As discussed above, the November 2018 rating decision is considered final as to the issue of entitlement to service connection for an eye disability, as the Veteran did not file a notice of disagreement and no additional evidence pertinent to the issue of entitlement to service connection for an eye disability was physically or constructively associated with the claims folder within one year of the decision.  The only other avenue to establishing an earlier effective date is to allege clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in that earlier rating decision, which must be specifically pled.  See Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43 (1993).  However, the Veteran has not alleged CUE in the prior final rating decision, nor has such issue been reasonably raised by the record.

Here, the Board has reviewed the entire claims file, paying particular attention to the Veteran's submissions to VA between the November 2018 final rating decision and his June 24, 2022, claim for any document that could be considered a claim of entitlement to service connection for an eye disability.  There is no evidence that the Veteran filed a notice of disagreement within one year following the November 2018 rating decision, nor may any of his correspondence during that period be construed as a request to reopen the claim of entitlement to service connection for an eye disability.

Consequently, the claim of entitlement to an effective date prior to June 24, 2022, for the award of service connection for diplopia must be denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as the evidence weighs against the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date, that doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

7. Entitlement to an effective date for the award of special monthly compensation based on housebound criteria being met

Special monthly compensation is payable at the housebound rate if the veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent and either of the following are met: (1) there is additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems; or (2) he is permanently housebound by reason of service-connected disability or disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).  The regulation defines permanently housebound as substantial confinement as a direct result of service-connected disabilities to his or her dwelling and the immediate premises or, if institutionalized, to the ward or clinical areas, and it is reasonably certain that the disability or disabilities and resultant confinement will continue throughout his or her lifetime.  38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

The Veteran is seeking earlier effective dates for the award of SMC based on housebound criteria being met.

The Veteran has not stated what effective date he believes to be appropriate for the award of SMC at the housebound rate.

In the October 2023 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ granted entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate, effective June 24, 2022.  The decision explained that, from that date, the Veteran had service-connected PTSD rated 100 percent disabling and additional service-connected disabilities of right upper extremity muscle weakness associated with multiple sclerosis, right lower extremity muscle weakness associated with multiple sclerosis, voiding dysfunction associated with multiple sclerosis, erectile dysfunction associated with multiple sclerosis, diplopia associated with multiple sclerosis, pseudofolliculitis barbae with facial scarring, left knee strain with shin splints, right knee strain with shin splints, right index finger crush tip injury, independently ratable at 60 percent or more from June 24, 2022.

Prior to June 24, 2022, the Veteran is service connected for PTSD (rated as 100 percent disabling); pseudofolliculitis barbae with facial scarring (rated as 30 percent disabling); right index finger crush tip injury (rated as 10 percent disabling); left knee strain with shin splints (rated as 10 percent disabling); and right knee strain with shin splints (rated as 10 percent disabling).

Unfortunately, the Board finds that the claim of entitlement to an earlier effective date for SMC at the housebound rate must be denied, as the statutory criteria of 38 U.S.C. § 1114(s)(1) were not satisfied prior to June 24, 2022, in this case.  The record does not contain evidence that the Veteran was housebound prior to June 24, 2022.  Further, there is no evidence or assertion that the Veteran was substantially confined to his dwelling and immediate premises as a direct result of service-connected disabilities, or institutionalized, prior to June 24, 2022, to meet the alternative qualifications for SMC at the housebound rate.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(i).

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as the evidence weighs persuasively against the Veteran's claims of entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 24, 2022, for the award of SMC based on housebound criteria being met, that doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

8. Entitlement to an effective date for the award of a 10 percent disability rating for right index finger crush tip injury

By way of background, the AOJ granted service connection for right index finger crush tip injury by a November 2017 rating decision and assigned a 10 percent rating effective April 21, 2017.  Thereafter, within one year of the November 2017 rating decision, the Veteran filed a claim of entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) in February 2018, which the AOJ construed as a claim of entitlement to an increased rating for right index finger crush tip injury.  A July 2018 rating decision continued the 10 percent disability rating.  He did not file a notice of disagreement and no additional evidence pertinent to the issue was physically or constructively associated with the claims folder within one year of that decision.  Thus, the July 2018 rating decision became final.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.1103.

In June 2022, the Veteran filed an application, in pertinent part, for entitlement to an increased rating for right index finger crush tip injury.  The November 2022 rating decision continued the 10 percent disability rating.  In June 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the November 2022 rating decision.  In October 2023, the AOJ issued the HLR decision, which continued the 10 percent disability rating.  

As is evident from the procedural history, the Veteran has had a 10 percent disability rating for right index finger crush tip injury since service connection was established by the November 2017 rating decision.  In the absence of more specificity on the January 2021 VA Form 10182, the Board can only infer that the Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for the assignment of the 10 percent rating.

Accordingly, the Veteran's desire for an earlier effective date for the 10 percent disability rating is tantamount to a freestanding earlier effective date claim, which is precluded.  Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006) (stating that a freestanding claim for earlier effective date vitiates the rule against finality).  Neither the Veteran nor his representative has asserted that the November 2017 rating decision contained clear and unmistakable error.  Accordingly, the Veteran's claim must be dismissed.

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Consideration must be given to increased evaluations under other potentially applicable Diagnostic Codes.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 595 (1991).

The veteran's entire history is reviewed when assigning disability ratings.  See generally 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  If there is disagreement with the initial rating assigned following a grant of service connection, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time, based upon the facts found.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 125-26 (1999).  But where service connection has already been established, and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  The relevant focus for adjudicating an increased rating claim is on the evidence concerning the state of the disability from the time period one year before the claim was filed until VA makes a final decision on the claim.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement.  See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011).  Nonetheless, even when the factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a; a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate.  See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a criteria.").

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, painful motion is a factor to be considered with any form of arthritis; however, 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 is not limited to disabilities involving arthritis.  See Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

1. Entitlement to an increased disability rating for right upper extremity muscle weakness associated with multiple sclerosis

2. Entitlement to an increased disability rating for right lower extremity muscle weakness associated with multiple sclerosis

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for his right upper extremity muscle weakness associated with multiple sclerosis and in excess of 10 percent for right lower extremity muscle weakness associated with multiple sclerosis.

His right upper extremity muscle weakness is evaluated under DC 8018-8514, applicable to multiple sclerosis and paralysis of the radial nerve.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.  Hyphenated Diagnostic Codes are used when a rating under one Diagnostic Code requires use of an additional Diagnostic Code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

His right lower extremity muscle weakness is evaluated under DC 8520, applicable to paralysis of the sciatic nerve.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a. 

Under Diagnostic Code 8018, a minimum 30 percent rating is warranted for multiple sclerosis.  Disability ratings higher than 30 percent must be based on its residuals.  With some exceptions, disability from neurological conditions and convulsive disorders and their residuals may be rated from 10 to 100 percent in proportion to the impairment of motor, sensory, or mental function.  Manifestations include psychotic symptoms, complete partial loss of use of one or more extremities, speech disturbances, impairment of vision, disturbances of gait, tremors, visceral manifestations, etc., referring to the appropriate bodily system of the schedule.  Partial loss of one or more extremities from neurological lesions, such as those caused by multiple sclerosis, is rated by comparison with mild, moderate, severe, or complete paralysis of peripheral nerves.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.

A note following DC 8018 further explains how the ratings are to be applied: 

It is required for the minimum ratings for residuals under diagnostic codes 8000-8025, that there be ascertainable residuals.  Id.  Determinations as to the presence of residuals not capable of objective verification, i.e., headaches, dizziness, fatigability, must be approached on the basis of the diagnosis recorded; subjective residuals will be accepted when consistent with the disease and not more likely attributable to other disease or no disease.  Id.  It is of exceptional importance that when ratings in excess of the prescribed minimum ratings are assigned, the diagnostic codes utilized as bases of evaluation be cited, in addition to the codes identifying the diagnoses.  Id.

In other words, the Rating Schedule evaluates multiple sclerosis based on its manifestations.  In accordance with the plain language of the diagnostic code, to receive the 30 percent minimum rating there must be at least one manifestation of multiple sclerosis.  

If there is at least one manifestation, then the diagnostic code acts as a ratings floor-regardless of the severity of the manifestations, the mere fact that they are present entitles a veteran to at least a 30 percent rating.  If the manifestations, as evaluated pursuant to their own respective Diagnostic Codes or as rated by analogy, warrant a rating in excess of 30 percent, then Diagnostic Code 8018 is read in conjunction with 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.14 and 4.25(b), and the veteran is assigned separate ratings that do not overlap in symptoms.

When the combined disability rating resulting from these residuals exceeds 30 percent, the separate ratings will be assigned in place of the minimum rating assigned under Diagnostic Code 8018.

Diagnostic Code 8514 provides ratings for both the "major" and the "minor" extremity.  In this context, "major" and "minor" refer to the dominant and nondominant side.  Here, the Veteran's major extremity (dominant) is the right upper extremity.

Under Diagnostic Code 8514, a 30 percent rating is warranted for moderate incomplete paralysis of the major extremity.  A 50 percent rating is warranted for severe incomplete paralysis of the major extremity.  A 70 percent rating is warranted for complete paralysis of the major extremity. 

Under Diagnostic Code 8520, a 10 percent rating is warranted for mild paralysis of the sciatic nerve.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for moderate paralysis of the sciatic nerve.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for moderately severe paralysis of the sciatic nerve.  A 60 percent rating is warranted for severe paralysis of the sciatic nerve with marked muscular atrophy.  An 80 percent rating is warranted for complete paralysis of the sciatic nerve, which contemplates the foot dangles and drops, no active movement possible of muscles below the knee, flexion of knee weakened or (very rarely) lost.

The term "marked" is not defined in the regulation. When a regulation includes ambiguous or subjective terms, the Board must define such term.  See Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 255 (2018).  The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines "marked" as "having a distinctive or emphasized character."  See https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/marked (last visited March 14, 2025).

In applying the schedular criteria for rating peripheral nerve disabilities, the term 'incomplete paralysis' indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type pictured for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  Attention should be given to the site and character of the injury, the relative impairment and motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120.

Additionally, words such as "mild," "moderate," and "severe" are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Rather than applying a mechanical formula, VA must evaluate all evidence, to the end that decisions will be "equitable and just."  38 C.F.R. § 4.6.  Although the use of similar terminology by medical professionals should be considered, it is not dispositive of an issue.  Instead, all evidence must be evaluated in arriving at a decision regarding a request for an increased disability rating.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6.

The Board acknowledges that the VA Adjudicative Procedures Manual M21-1 (hereinafter M21-1) contains provisions regarding rating peripheral nerve disabilities.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has held that the Board is not bound by the provisions of the M21-1 and the manual does not "carry the force of law."  DAV v. Sec'y of Veterans Affs., 859 F.3d 1072, 1077 (Fed. Cir. 2017).  It is "an internal manual used to convey guidance to VA adjudicators.  It is not intended to establish substantive rules beyond those contained in statute and regulation."  Id.  The M21-1 provisions do not go through the regular rulemaking procedures and are little more than evidence as to how VBA applies law and regulation in practices; they are not binding on the Board as they are not a regulation, instruction of the Secretary, or OGC opinion.  Id.; see also 38 U.S.C. § 7104(c).  The regulations further clarify that the Board "is not bound by Department manuals, circulars, or similar administrative issues."  38 C.F.R. § 20.105.

Nevertheless, in Overton v. Wilkie, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that the Board is required to discuss "any relevant provisions contained in the [M21-1] as part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases, but because it is not bound by those provisions, it must make its own determination before it chooses to rely on an [M21-1] provision as a factor to support its decision."  30 Vet. App. 257, 264 (2018).  More recently, in Wilson v. McDonough, the Court elaborated that, in the context of relevant guidance documents, the Board can "neither merely invoke nor ignore a relevant guidance provision to support its decision but must provide an independent rationale relating its decision to the relevant guidance document."  35 Vet. App. 75, 80 (2021).

Pursuant to Wilson, the Board finds that VA's M21-1 does contain guidance relevant to the adjudication of the issue currently on appeal.  Specifically, Part V, Subpart iii, Chapter 12, Section A(c) of the M21-1 provides "general guidelines" for the terms "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe" in the context of evaluating incomplete paralysis of upper and lower peripheral nerves.  

Under the M21-1, "mild" is described as the lowest level of evaluation based on the symptoms, however, slight, as long as they were sufficient to support a diagnosis of the peripheral nerve impairment.  Generally, "mild" is limited to a disability limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, and affecting a small area and/or a very minimal reflex or motor abnormality.

"Moderate" in the M21-1 is described as the maximum evaluation reserved for the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment.  The M21-1 further elaborates that the following "sign/symptom combinations" may fall into the moderate category: combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate.

The M21-1 provides that "moderately severe" is only applicable for involvement of the sciatic nerve and is described as motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability is expected.  Atrophy may be present with moderately severe peripheral neuropathy.  "Severe," in general, is expected to include motor and/or reflex impairment (for example atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability.  Trophic changes may be seen with severe longstanding neuropathy.  Even though severe incomplete paralysis cases should show findings substantially less than representative findings for complete impairment of the nerve, the disability picture for severe incomplete paralysis may contain signs/symptoms resembling some of those expected in cases of complete paralysis of the nerve.

The Veteran appeared for a VA multiple sclerosis examination in July 2022.  He reported right side numbness and weakness and right leg pain.  The examiner noted muscle weakness in the upper and/or lower extremities.  

Upon neurologic examination, the examiner noted an abnormal gait.  The Veteran dragged his right foot, and his gait was unsteady.  

As to the right upper extremity, the Veteran had less than normal strength with shoulder extension and flexion, elbow extension and flexion, wrist extension and flexion, grip, and pinch.  Deep tendon reflexes were decreased in the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis.  Sensation testing was decreased in the shoulder area, inner/outer forearm, hand/fingers, and thorax.  The examiner noted moderate right upper extremity muscle weakness.

As to the right lower extremity, the Veteran had normal strength with hip extension and flexion, knee extension, ankle plantar flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion.  Deep tendon reflexes were normal in the knee and ankle.  Sensation testing was normal in the anterior and posterior trunk, thigh/knee, lower leg/ankle, and foot/toes.  The examiner noted mild right lower extremity muscle weakness.

The Veteran appeared for a VA peripheral nerves conditions examination in July 2022.  He reported right arm numbness, tingling, and burning.  

As to the right upper extremity, the Veteran endorsed moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and numbness.  He displayed active movement against some resistance with elbow extension and flexion, wrist extension and flexion, grip, and pinch.  Deep tendon reflexes were decreased in the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis.  Sensation testing was for light touch decreased in the shoulder area, inner/outer forearm, and hand/fingers.

As to the right lower extremity, the Veteran endorsed moderate intermittent pain (usually dull).  He displayed normal strength with knee extension, ankle plantar flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion.  Deep tendon reflexes were normal in the knee and ankle.  Sensation testing for light touch was normal in the upper anterior thigh, thigh/knee, lower leg/ankle, and foot/toes.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's gait was unsteady.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence weighs against a disability rating in excess of 30 percent for right upper extremity muscle weakness for the relevant period on appeal.  This evaluation is consistent with the medical evidence of record, which fails to show the Veteran's right upper extremity muscle weakness was manifested by severe incomplete paralysis of the major extremity to warrant an increased rating at any time during the period on appeal.  Without evidence of severe incomplete paralysis of the major extremity, a disability rating in excess of 30 percent must be denied.

The Board further finds that the evidence weighs against a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for right lower extremity muscle weakness for the relevant period on appeal.  This evaluation is consistent with the medical evidence of record, which fails to show the Veteran's right lower extremity muscle weakness was manifested by moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve to warrant an increased rating at any time during the period on appeal.  Without evidence of moderate incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve, a disability rating in excess of 10 percent must be denied.

The Board is aware of the Court's recent decision in Banschbach v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 422, 429 (2024), which held that, as a matter of law, the assignment of a rating based on paralysis or incomplete paralysis under 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a does not preclude separate ratings for neuritis and neuralgia of the same nerve.  The Court further noted that, when determining how to evaluate separate conditions, adjudicators must first evaluate the ratable conditions before assessing whether compensable conditions present the same manifestation such that it constitutes impermissible pyramiding.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14.

Neuralgia is marked by "dull and intermittent pain," whereas neuritis manifests via "loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain, at times excruciating."  In comparison, paralysis is characterized by "loss of function."  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124, 4.124a.

In this case, the Board finds that a separate 10 percent rating is warranted for neuralgia of the right sciatic nerve for the entire period on appeal.  Notably, the July 2022 VA peripheral nerves examiner noted that the Veteran experienced mild intermittent pain such that a 10 percent rating is warranted under Diagnostic Code 8720.  The Board finds that a 10 percent rating for neuralgia during the relevant period on appeal based on intermittent pain does not constitute pyramiding because the Veteran's 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 8520 during this appeal period for right lower extremity muscle weakness is based on a separate finding of mild incomplete paralysis of the sciatic nerve.

In reaching the above-stated conclusions, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as the evidence weighs against the Veteran's claims of entitlement to increased ratings, beyond that assigned herein, that doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

3. Entitlement to an increased disability rating for voiding dysfunction associated with multiple sclerosis

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for his voiding dysfunction associated with multiple sclerosis

The Veteran's voiding dysfunction is evaluated under DC 7542, applicable to neurogenic bladder.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b.  Diagnostic Code 7542 instructs that the condition should be rated as a voiding dysfunction.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7542.  Voiding dysfunction is rated under the particular condition as urine leakage, frequency, or obstructed voiding.  38 C.F.R. § 4.115a.  Only the predominant area of dysfunction is considered for rating purposes. Id.

For continual urine leakage, post-surgical urinary diversion, urinary incontinence, or stress incontinence, a 20 percent rating is warranted for a condition requiring the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed less than 2 times per day.  A 40 percent rating is warranted for a condition requiring the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed 2 to 4 times per day.  A 60 percent rating is warranted for a condition requiring the use of an appliance or the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed more than 4 times per day. Id.

For urinary frequency, a 10 percent rating is warranted for daytime voiding interval between two and three hours, or awakening to void two times per night.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for daytime voiding interval between one and two hours, or awakening to void three to four times per night.  A maximum 40 percent rating is warranted for daytime voiding interval less than one hour, or awakening to void five or more times per night. Id.

For obstructed voiding, a noncompensable rating is warranted for obstructive symptomatology with or without stricture disease requiring dilatation 1 to 2 times per year.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for marked obstructive symptomatology (hesitancy, slow or weak stream, decreased force of stream) with any one or combination of the following: (1) post void residuals greater than 150 cc.; (2) uroflowmetry; markedly diminished peak flow rate (less than 10 cc/sec); (3) recurrent urinary tract infections secondary to obstruction; or (4) stricture disease requiring periodic dilatation every 2 to 3 months.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for urinary retention requiring intermittent or continuous catheterization.  

The Veteran appeared for a VA multiple sclerosis examination in July 2022.  The examiner noted that the Veteran had a voiding dysfunction that did not require use of absorbent material, cause obstructed voiding, nor require the use of an appliance.  The Veteran did not have a history of recurrent symptomatic urinary tract infections.  However, the Veteran endorsed a daytime voiding interval between two and three hours.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence does not reflect symptoms that would meet the criteria for a rating in excess of 10 percent for voiding dysfunction during the relevant period on appeal.  The evidence demonstrates that the Veteran has not been shown to have urinary frequency with daytime voiding interval between one and two hours, or awakening to void three to four times per night.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a, DC 7542.  Without such evidence, an evaluation in excess of 10 percent for voiding dysfunction cannot be granted.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the claim of entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for voiding dysfunction must be denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as the evidence weighs against the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an increased rating, that doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

4. Entitlement to an increased disability rating for erectile dysfunction associated with multiple sclerosis

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a compensable disability rating for his erectile dysfunction associated with multiple sclerosis.

The Veteran's erectile dysfunction is evaluated under DC 7522, applicable to erectile dysfunction with or without penile deformity.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b.  The Board notes that VA amended the criteria for rating the genitourinary systems effective from November 14, 2021.  These new regulations apply to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after November 14, 2021.  In the instant case, the new regulations apply.

Under Diagnostic Code 7522, the only schedular evaluation available is a 20 percent rating for a disease or traumatic injury of the penis resulting in scarring or deformity.  A footnote to DC 7522 also instructs the rater to review the claim for entitlement to SMC under 38 C.F.R. § 3.350.

In this case, a noncompensable rating was assigned because the requirements for the only compensable evaluation were not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.  The Veteran was also granted SMC for loss of use of a creative organ, effective June 24, 2022, which is the same effective date as his noncompensable evaluation for service-connected erectile dysfunction.

The issue is therefore whether the evidence more nearly approximates a disease or traumatic injury of the penis resulting in scarring or deformity to meet the compensable rating criteria of DC 7522.  For the following reasons, a compensable rating for service-connected erectile dysfunction is not warranted.

The Veteran appeared for a VA multiple sclerosis examination in July 2022.  The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have erectile dysfunction attributable to multiple sclerosis and was able to achieve an erection-with medication-sufficient for penetration and ejaculation.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence does not reflect symptoms that would meet the criteria for a compensable rating for erectile dysfunction during the relevant period on appeal.  The evidence demonstrates that the Veteran has not been shown to have a disease or traumatic injury of the penis resulting in scarring or deformity.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a, DC 7522.  Without such evidence, a compensable disability rating for erectile dysfunction cannot be granted.  As indicated above, SMC for loss of use of a creative organ has already been awarded.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the claim of entitlement to a compensable disability rating for erectile dysfunction must be denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as the evidence weighs against the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an increased rating, that doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

5. Entitlement to an increased disability rating for right index finger crush tip injury

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for his right index finger crush tip injury.

His right index finger crush tip injury is evaluated under DC 5229, applicable to limitation of motion of the index or long finger.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Under Diagnostic Code 5229, a noncompensable rating is warranted for limitation of motion of the major (dominant) thumb with a gap of less than one inch (2.5 cm.) between the fingertip and the proximal transverse crease of the palm, with the finger flexed to the extent possible, and extension is limited by no more than 30 degrees.  A 10 percent disability rating is warranted for limitation of motion of the major thumb with a gap of one inch (2.5 cm.) or more between the fingertip and the proximal transverse crease of the palm, with the finger flexed to the extent possible, or with extension limited by more than 30 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5229.

The Veteran appeared for a VA hand and finger conditions examination in July 2022.  He reported numbness and tingling in the right index finger.  He denied flare-ups, as well as functional loss or impairment.

Right index finger active range of motion revealed flexion of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint ended at 60 degrees and extension ended at 0 degrees; flexion of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint ended at 100 degrees and extension ended at 0 degrees; flexion of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint ended at 50 degrees and extension ended at 0 degrees.  On active range of motion, there was a one centimeter gap between the index finger and proximal transverse crease of the hand on maximal finger flexion.  There was no objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue.  

Passive range of motion revealed flexion of the MCP joint ended at 70 degrees and extension ended at 0 degrees; flexion of the PIP joint ended at 100 degrees and extension ended at 0 degrees; flexion of the DIP joint ended at 50 degrees and extension ended at 0 degrees.  On passive range of motion, there was no gap between the pad of the thumb and the fingers nor between the finger and proximal transverse crease of the hand on maximal finger flexion.  There was no objective evidence of localized tenderness or pain on palpation of the joint or associated soft tissue.  

There was no evidence of pain on examination.  The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing with at least three repetitions without additional functional loss or range of motion.  Though the Veteran was not being examined immediately after repetitive use over time, procured evidence did not suggest pain, fatigability, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination significantly limited functional ability with repeated use over time.  There were no additional contributing factors of disability.  Muscle atrophy nor ankylosis was present.  Muscle strength testing revealed active movement with gravity eliminated in hand grip.  There were no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms related to the Veteran's right index finger crush tip injury.

The Board notes that the Veteran's right index finger crush tip injury has been rated 10 percent disabling since the effective date of the award of service connection, June 24, 2022.  Thus, the Veteran has been in receipt of the maximum schedular rating available under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5229 (and under Diagnostic Code 5225 for ankylosis).  

As the Veteran is in receipt of the maximum available ratings under Diagnostic Code 5229 (and under Diagnostic Code 5225 for ankylosis), the Board concludes that the maximum rating fully accounts for the Veteran's reports of numbness and tingling, as there is no higher rating available.  See DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. at 202; Mitchell, 25 Vet. App. at 32; Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017).

Accordingly, the Board finds that the claim of entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for right index finger crush tip injury must be denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as the evidence weighs against the Veteran's claim of entitlement to an increased rating, that doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to an increased disability rating for diplopia associated with multiple sclerosis

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a compensable disability rating for his diplopia associated with multiple sclerosis.

The Veteran appeared for a VA multiple sclerosis examination in July 2022.  The examiner noted that the Veteran had diplopia that was attributable to multiple sclerosis.  The multiple sclerosis disability benefits questionnaire instructs the examiner to complete the appropriate eye disability benefits questionnaire if any visual disturbances are attributable to multiple sclerosis.  However, the Board notes that the appropriate eye disability benefits questionnaire was not completed.  This pre-decisional duty to assist error should be remedied on remand by obtaining a VA eye examination to assess the severity of the Veteran's service-connected diplopia.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with the appropriate examiner to ascertain the current severity and manifestations of his service-connected diplopia.  Any and all studies, tests, and evaluations deemed necessary by the examiner should be performed.  The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's diplopia under the rating criteria.
