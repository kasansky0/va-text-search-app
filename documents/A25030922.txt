DOCKET NO. 240723-459218
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

An effective date prior to February 2, 2022 for eligibility to Dependents Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's service-connected disabilities did not result in permanent total disability until February 2, 2022 and therefore eligibility for DEA benefits is not shown until that time.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Prior to February 2, 2022, the criteria for eligibility to DEA under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.807.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from January 1974 to November 1975.

As pertinent here, the Veteran filed a claim for increased rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on February 2, 2022.  A claim for entitlement to individual unemployability (TDIU) was raised by the record and deferred by an April 2022 rating decision.  

Thereafter, a January 2024 rating decision granted entitlement to a TDIU effective February 2, 2022, and granted entitlement to DEA benefits effective the same date.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Earlier Effective Date for DEA Benefits

Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, the Board finds that an earlier effective date is not warranted.  The Veteran was awarded eligibility to DEA effective February 2, 2022, based upon the date his service-connected warranted entitlement to a TDIU.

Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), effective dates relating to awards under Chapter 35 shall, to the extent feasible, correspond to effective dates relating to awards of disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. § 5113.  Subsection (b) provides that when determining the effective date of an award under Chapter 35 for an individual described in paragraph (b)(2) of 38 U.S.C. § 5113, based on an original claim, VA may consider the individual's application as having been filed on the eligibility date of the individual if that eligibility date is more than one year before the date of the initial rating decision.  For these purposes, "eligibility date" means the date on which the individual became an eligible person as defined by 38 U.S.C. § 3501 (a)(1), and "initial rating decision" means a decision by VA that establishes the Veteran's total disability as permanent in nature.  38 U.S.C. § 5113(3).

In the case of a veteran who is alive, the conditions for basic eligibility for DEA include: (1) the Veteran's discharge from service under conditions other than dishonorable; and (2) the Veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.807 (a).  Total disability will be considered to exist when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  Total disability may or may not be permanent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a).  Permanence of disability will be taken to exist when such impairment is reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled person.  38 C.F.R. § 3.340(b).  The term "total disability permanent in nature" for the purpose of DEA benefits means any disability rated total for the purposes of disability compensation which is based on an impairment reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled person.  38 U.S.C. § 3501(a)(7).

As the only method of eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits which is relevant to the Veteran is through having a permanent total service-connected disability, the effective date for Dependents' Educational Assistance benefits is directly predicated on the effective date from which VA considered that the Veteran's permanent and total disability commenced for purposes of VA benefits.  See 38 C.F.R. § 21.3021(a)(iii), (p), (r).

Considering the TDIU has been granted effective February 2, 2022, the Board notes that the effective date for establishing eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits must also be the same.  Thus, an effective date prior to February 2, 2022 for DEA benefits is not warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (a).

The Board acknowledges the representative's September 2024 argument regarding earlier effective date for entitlement to a TDIU; however, in the July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran specifically listed only the issue of "Basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability status is established from February 2, 2022."  He did not list the issue granting entitlement to a TDIU.  Accordingly, the Board does not have judicial purview to address the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for TDIU under the present appeal because the Veteran did not appeal this issue.

Lastly, the Board notes that in the July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran also identified issues of entitlement to service connection for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and sleep apnea; however, these issues were not adjudicated by any rating decision within a year of the July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  Accordingly, here again, the Board does not have judicial purview to consider these issues under the present appeal.
