REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served in the United States Air Force from August 1979 to April 1987. He also served in the Air Force Reserves.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2020 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the August 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2020 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, because the Board is remanding the claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

These matters were previously before the Board in February 2024, at which time the Board determined that new and relevant evidence had not been found, and thus readjudication of these issues was denied. The Veteran timely appealed this decision to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court).

In a December 2024 Joint Motion for Partial Remand (JMPR), the parties agreed that the Board erred when it provided an inadequate statement of reasons and bases because it failed to address relevant evidence. Specifically, the parties noted the Board found the Veteran's earliest period of active-duty service began in July 1983; however, the record contains AF Form 526, ANG/USAFR Point Credit Summary, that shows the Veteran had active duty service beginning in 1979. As such, the parties agreed that remand was required for the Board to address this evidence and readjudicate the above claims.

Upon review of the file, the Board finds that the evidence of record establishes that the Veteran had a period of service prior to July 1983. A copy of DD Form 471, Enlistment/Reenlistment Document - Armed Forces of the United States, shows the Veteran enlisted in the USAF on August 3, 1979. Additionally, the Veteran's DD 214 for the period from July 6, 1983, to April 1, 1987, shows that the Veteran had 3 years, 11 months, and 3 days of prior service, and the "Military Education" block notes the Veteran attended USAF basic training in September 1979 and the law enforcement specialist course in November 1979. Thus, the Board finds the Veteran's earliest period of active duty service began on August 3, 1979, the date which he first enlisted in the USAF.

While there are documents in the record showing the Veteran first entered into active duty service on August 3, 1979, there are no correlating service treatment records or military personnel records. Because the AF Form 526, DD Form 471, and DD 214 were all of record at the time of the July 2020 rating decision, the AOJ should have obtained all outstanding records associated with the Veteran's service beginning August 3, 1979. As such, the AOJ's failure to obtain these records constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error, and remand is necessary in order to obtain these records.

Accordingly, these matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain all outstanding service records related to the Veteran's period of service beginning August 3, 1979. If any of these records are unavailable, the AOJ is to document all attempts to obtain said records and inform he Veteran that said records cannot be located and/or procured.

2. Following completion of the above development, readjudicate the claims.
