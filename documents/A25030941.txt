ORDER

Entitlement to an increased rating of 50 percent from August 27, 2021 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and asthma, is granted. 

Entitlement to an increased rating of 30 percent from March 28, 2024 for diabetic neuropathy of the right upper extremity, is granted.

Entitlement to an increased initial rating of 60 percent for chronic kidney disease (CKD), is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, from August 27, 2021, his sleep apnea required the use of a breathing assistance device such as a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and the evidence does not support a finding that the Veteran's COPD with OSA and asthma results in FEV-1 of 40-to 55-percent predicted or FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, nor requires monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations or intermittent courses of systemic corticosteroids. 

2. From March 28, 2024, the Veteran's diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the right upper extremity manifests in moderate incomplete paralysis.

3. During the appeal period, the Veteran's CKD more closely approximates a 60 percent rating due to eGFR of 30 to 44 mL/min/1.73 m2 over three consecutive months during a 12-month period.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a rating of 50 percent from August 27, 2021 for COPD with OSA and asthma have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.97, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6602-6847. 

2. The criteria for entitlement to a disability rating of 30 percent from March 28, 2024 for diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the right upper extremity have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.14, 4.124a, DC 8514.

3. The criteria for an initial rating in excess of 30 percent for chronic kidney disease have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.115a, 4.115b, DC 7530.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from April 1962 to April 1988.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of two rating decisions from January 2025 by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The Veteran filed his timely VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal and chose direct review by a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ). 

Accordingly, the Board will consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2025 rating decisions. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.

Increased ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity as a result of a service-connected disability, and separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

VA has a duty to consider all regulations that are potentially applicable through the assertions and issues raised in the record. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  The Board will consider whether separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on facts found, a practice known as "staged ratings."  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Effective dates

In general, the effective date of an award of disability compensation, in conjunction with a grant of entitlement to service connection, is the date of receipt of a claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date of compensation will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claimant's application, unless the application is received within one year of discharge from service. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a).

The general rule regarding effective dates is that the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date of an award of disability compensation, in conjunction with a grant of entitlement to service connection on a direct basis, shall be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year of separation from service. Otherwise, the effective date shall be the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i).

A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Secretary of VA must be filed in order for benefits to be paid to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.151. The term "claim" or "application" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief of entitlement, to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p). "Date of receipt" generally means the date on which a claim, information, or evidence was received by VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1(r).

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2), the effective date of an award of increased disability compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if application is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of VA receipt of the claim for increase, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. Id.; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), (b)(3).

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2) are applicable only where an increase in disability precedes a claim for an increased disability rating; otherwise, the general rule of 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1) applies. See Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125, 126 (1997). Thus, three possible dates may be assigned depending on the facts of the case:

(1) if an increase in disability occurs after the claim is filed, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (date entitlement arose) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1));

(2) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by a year or less, the date that the increase is shown to have occurred (factually ascertainable) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2));

(3) if an increase in disability precedes the claim by more than a year, the date that the claim is received (date of claim) (38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2)).

Harper, 10 Vet. App at 126. Thus, determining an appropriate effective date for an increased rating under the effective date regulations involves an analysis of the evidence to determine (1) when a claim for an increased rating was received and, if possible, (2) when the increase in disability actually occurred. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400(o)(2).

1. Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 30 percent for COPD with OSA and asthma

The Veteran contends he is entitled to an increased rating for his COPD with OSA and asthma.

The Veteran's disability is evaluated under DC 6602-6847, applicable to bronchial asthma and sleep apnea syndromes (obstructive, central, mixed). Hyphenated DCs are used when a rating under one DC requires use of an additional DC to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

Rating co-existing respiratory conditions is governed by 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(a), which states that ratings under DCs 6600 through 6817 and 6822 through 6847 will not be combined with each other. Where there is lung or pleural involvement, ratings under DCs 6819 and 6820 will not be combined with each other or with DCs 6600 through 6817 or 6822 through 6847. A single rating will be assigned under the DC which reflects the predominant disability with elevation to the next higher evaluation where the severity of the overall disability warrants such evaluation. Accordingly, separate ratings for asthma under DC 6602 and sleep apnea under DC 6847 are not permitted and the Board will consider which DC is more appropriate throughout the appeal period.

Under DC 6602, a 30 percent evaluation is warranted for an FEV-1 of 56- to 70-percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent, or; daily inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy, or; inhalational anti-inflammatory medication. A 60 percent evaluation is warranted for an FEV-1 of 40- to 55-percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, or; at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or; intermittent (at least three per year) courses of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids. A maximum 100 percent evaluation is warranted for an FEV-1 less than 40-percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC less than 40 percent, or; more than one attack per week with episodes of respiratory failure, or; requires daily use of systemic (oral or parenteral) high dose corticosteroids or immuno-suppressive medications. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6602.

Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) results are generally reported before and after the administration of bronchodilator therapy. VA regulations require the use of post-bronchodilator results in determining disability ratings for DCs 6600, 6603, 6604, 6825-6833, and 6840-6845, unless post-bronchodilator results are poorer than pre-bronchodilator results. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(4). There are no regulations specifying whether pre- or post-bronchodilator results should be used when determining disability ratings under DC 6602.

It is important to note that post-bronchodilator studies are required when PFT's are done for disability evaluation purposes except when the results of pre-bronchodilator pulmonary function tests are normal or when the examiner determines that post-bronchodilator studies should not be done and states why. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(4). Additionally, post-bronchodilator results are to be used in applying the evaluation criteria in the rating schedule unless the post-bronchodilator results are poorer than the pre-bronchodilator results. In those cases, the pre-bronchodilator values are used for rating purposes. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(5). 

When there is a disparity between the results of different PFT's so that the level of evaluation would differ depending on which test result is used, the test result that the examiner states most accurately reflect the Veteran's level of disability is to be used. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(6).

Sleep apnea syndromes, whether obstructive, central, or mixed in nature, are rated under DC 6847. A 50 percent rating is assigned for sleep apnea that requires the use of a breathing assistance device such as a continuous airway pressure (CPAP) machine. A 100 percent rating is assigned for sleep apnea manifested by chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale, or if the condition requires tracheostomy. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6847.

Here, the Veteran contends he is entitled to a 60 percent rating based on the August 2019 VA examination. The August 2019 VA respiratory condition examination showed the Veteran's PFT resulted in FVC of 60 percent predicted, FEV-1 of 51 percent predicted and FEV-1/FVC of 85 percent predicted. The examiner indicated the Veteran's FEV-1/FVC most accurately reflects the Veteran's level of disability. The examiner found the Veteran's respiratory condition does not require the use of oral or parenteral corticosteroid medications. The examiner indicated the Veteran did not require daily inhalational bronchodilator therapy or inhalational anti-inflammatory medication.

The Veteran was afforded a VA respiratory condition examination in January 2023. The examiner found the Veteran underwent a PFT in February 2023. The results  showed the Veteran's PFT resulted in FVC of 90 percent predicted, FEV-1 of 89 percent predicted and FEV-1/FVC of 97 percent predicted. The examiner indicated the Veteran's FEV-1/FVC most accurately reflects the Veteran's level of disability. The examiner found the Veteran's respiratory condition does not require the use of oral or parenteral corticosteroid medications. The examiner indicated the Veteran requires daily inhalational bronchodilator therapy.

As noted above, when there is a disparity between the results of different PFT's so that the level of evaluation would differ depending on which test result is used, the test result that the examiner states most accurately reflect the Veteran's level of disability is to be used. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(6). Here, the examiners of records have consistently found the Veteran's FEV-1/FVC most accurately reflects the Veteran's level of disability. Thus, pursuant to DC 6602, the Veteran's disability manifest in daily inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy, or; inhalational anti-inflammatory medication which results in a 30 percent rating. 

The Veteran also contends he is entitled to an evaluation in excess of 30 percent for his sleep apnea. Specifically, he asserts a 50 percent rating is warranted because it has been medically determined he needs a CPAP. The Board notes the Veteran attempted to appeal both an increased rating for COPD and a separate issue of an increased rating for OSA. As discussed below, the Veteran does not have two separate ratings for COPD and OSA. In this case, the Veteran is assigned a single disability rating for his coexisting respiratory conditions of COPD, OSA, and asthma. 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(a).

The Veteran was afforded a VA sleep apnea examination in July 2023. The examiner indicated a diagnosis of OSA. The Veteran further reported he was unable to tolerate the use of a CPAP. The Veteran endorsed persistent daytime hypersomnolence attributable to his sleep apnea.

Review of the evidence shows the Veteran reported he was diagnosed with sleep apnea and assigned a CPAP machine. Medical records from September 2024 show the Veteran was advised to use a CPAP and was awaiting contact from the supplier.

After careful review of the evidence of record and resolving any doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that a 50 percent rating is warranted for his COPD with obstructive sleep apnea and asthma.

As outlined above, OSA requiring use of breathing assistance device such as CPAP machine warrants a 50 percent rating. The adjective "required" is not defined in the Rating Schedule. As with any regulatory interpretation, however, where the terms are not defined in the regulation it is reasonable to presume those terms carry their ordinary dictionary meaning. See Moody v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 329, 336 (2018); see also Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2415 (2019) (holding that where regulatory terms are unambiguous, the plain meaning dictionary definition can be used). Required has been defined as stipulated as necessary to be done, made, or provided https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/required (last visited March 31, 2025).

Weighing the severity of the Veteran's sleep apnea and breathing assistance device recommendations with the Veteran's treatment noncompliance, the evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran has required use of a breathing assistance device. When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Board must resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. Thus, a 50 percent rating for sleep apnea is warranted.

The criteria for a 100 percent rating for sleep apnea has not been met because the Veteran has not exhibited chronic respiratory failure with carbon dioxide retention or cor pulmonale or required tracheostomy. In this limited respect, the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a rating higher than 50 percent, and the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

Resolving any doubt in the Veteran's favor, an initial 50 percent rating, and no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's COPD with OSA and asthma. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7. The Board notes the effective date of August 27, 2021, which reflects the date the Veteran filed his claim for OSA which is the earliest date by law. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Additionally, for the entire period on appeal, including prior to August 27, 2021,  the Veteran's COPD with asthma disability did not manifest with the severity to warrant an increased rating in excess of 30 percent. 

2. Entitlement to an increased rating of 30 percent for diabetic neuropathy, right upper extremity

The Veteran contends he is entitled to the next higher rating of 30 percent for his right upper extremity neuropathy. 

In an Augst 2018 Board decision, the Veteran was denied an increased rating in excess of 20 percent. The Veteran appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC). However, the Veteran did not appeal the denial for an increased rating for right upper extremity neuropathy. Thus, the Board decision was final.

Then, in March 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995 supplemental claim. The Veteran's representative stated the Veteran disagreed with the March 2023 rating decision. The Board notes the March 2023 rating decision did not address the Veteran's right upper extremity neuropathy and the Board construes the supplemental claim as a claim for an increase rating. 

Under DC 8514 for the upper extremities, mild incomplete paralysis is rated as 20 percent for both the major and minor extremity. Moderate incomplete paralysis is rated as 30 percent for the major extremity and 20 percent for the minor extremity. Severe incomplete paralysis is rated as 50 percent for the major extremity and 40 percent for the minor extremity. Complete paralysis is rated as 70 percent disabling for the major extremity and 60 percent disabling for the minor extremity. Complete being drop of hand and fingers, wrist and fingers perpetually flexed, the thumb adducted falling within the line of the outer border of the index finger; cannot extend hand at wrist, extend proximal phalanges of fingers, extend thumb, or make lateral movement of wrist; supination of hand, extension and flexion of elbow weakened, the loss of synergic motion of extensors impairs the hand grip seriously; total paralysis of the triceps occurs only as the greatest rarity.

Descriptive words such as "mild," "moderate" and "severe" as used in the various DCs are not defined in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence for "equitable and just decisions." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6. According to MERRIAM WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 999 (11th Ed. 2007), "mild" moderate in action or effect or not severe. "Moderate" means limited in scope or effect. "Severe" means of a great degree.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function that is substantially less than that which is described in the criteria for an evaluation for complete paralysis of this nerve, whether the less than total paralysis is due to the varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial nerve regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a

The Veteran was afforded a VA diabetic sensory examination in September 2021. The Veteran was noted as right hand dominant. The examiner found the Veteran's right upper extremity neuropathy manifested with moderate intermittent pain, moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and moderate numbness. The Veteran's radial, median, and ulnar nerves were found to manifest in moderate incomplete paralysis. The Veteran's deep tenson reflexes and strength were all normal. The Veteran was noted as having decreased sensation from light touch/monofilament testing. 

The Board finds that the evidence supports a finding that the Veteran's right upper extremity symptoms were more accurately characterized as moderate incomplete paralysis due to the Veteran's moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and moderate numbness.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran's right upper extremity peripheral neuropathy manifests with moderate impairment beginning March 28, 2024, warranting a 30 percent rating for the right upper extremity.

Additionally, after careful review of the record, the Board finds that the evidence detailed above is persuasively against awarding a rating in excess of 30 percent for the right upper extremity. There is not medical or lay evidence showing the Veteran's upper right extremity neuropathy manifests in severe impairment. 

Lastly, with regards to the effective date, there is no medical evidence showing an increase in severity of right upper extremity neuropathy within one year of the March 2024 supplemental claim. Thus, the effective date of the rating increase is March 28, 2024, the date the Veteran filed his supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). The Veteran's representative points out the September 2021 VA diabetic sensory examination in support of a 30 percent rating. However, this showing of an increased of severity falls outside of the one year look back period from the March 2024 supplemental claim pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

3. Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 30 percent for CKD

The Veteran contends he is entitled to an increased rating for his CKD.

The Veteran's CKD is rated as 30 percent disabling under DC 7530, which instructs that chronic renal disease is to be rated as renal dysfunction. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a, which provides the criteria for rating renal dysfunction, a noncompensable rating is warranted for CKD with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2 and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) greater than 30 mg/g for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months.

A 30 percent rating is warranted with GFR from 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2 and structural kidney abnormalities (cystic, obstructive, or glomerular) for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months; or GFR from 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m2 and either recurrent red blood cell (RBC) casts, white blood cell (WBC) casts, or granular casts for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months; or with GFR from 45 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months.

A 60 percent rating is warranted for CKD with GFR from 30 to 44 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months.

An 80 percent rating requires CKD with GFR from 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months.

A maximum 100 percent evaluation is assigned for CKD with GFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months; or requiring regular routine dialysis; or eligible kidney transplant recipient. 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a.

The Board notes that if the medical record contains multiple lab tests during a 12-month period, separated by at least 3 months, and there is no evidence to contradict those findings in the interim period, VA will accept that the demonstrated renal dysfunction has persisted for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months.

The Veteran was afforded a VA kidney examination in December 2021. The examiner indicated a diagnosis of an acute kidney injury. The Veteran's GFR was measured at 41. The Veteran was afforded a VA kidney examination in June 2023. The examiner indicated a diagnosis of CKD with renal dysfunction. The Veteran's GFR was measured at 46. Private medical records from July 2024 show the Veteran's GFR was measured at 35. In August 2024, the Veteran's GFR was 28.

The Board finds the severity of the Veteran's CKD more closely approximates in a 60 percent rating due to the GFR readings from July and August 2024.

The Board has considered whether a higher disability rating is warranted for CKD, but the evidence of record does not show a GFR or eGFR less than 30 for at least 3 consecutive months during the past 12 months. As such, a higher disability rating than 60 percent is not warranted for the Veteran's CKD.
