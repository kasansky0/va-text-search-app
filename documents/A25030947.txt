ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of August 24, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for allergic rhinitis, is granted.

Entitlement to an effective date of August 24, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection for chronic sinusitis, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A July 2019 rating decision denied entitlement to service connection for chronic sinusitis; the Veteran did not initiate an appeal of that rating decision, which therefore, became final.

2. The Veteran filed claims for service connection for allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis disabilities on August 24, 2023, pursuant to the PACT Act.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of August 24, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection of allergic rhinitis, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.1, 3.151, 3.114, 3.400 (2024).

2. The criteria for an effective date of August 24, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection of sinusitis, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110 (2018); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.1, 3.151, 3.114, 3.400 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from December 1987 to December 1991.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement, "NOD"), the Veteran elected the Direct Review Docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Initially, the Board notes that in the August 2024, VA Form 10182, the Veteran identified a rating decision date which does not exist and also failed to properly identify an alleged error of fact or law, thereby frustrating the Board's ability to adjudicate an appealed claim.

As to the former, the NOD states that the rating decision being appealed from was issued on "3/24/2024." See August 2024, VA Form 10182. Review of the record confirms that there were no rating decisions issued, or notifications provided, on that date. A rating decision was issued on March 15, 2024, with notice sent to the Veteran and his representative on March 19, 2024; however, that rating decision addressed claims related to bilateral hearing loss and thoracic myofascial strain.

In the August 2024 NOD, the issues identified are as follows: "Allergic Rhinitis: Under the PACT," and "Chronic Maxillary: Under the PACT." Id. Given this language, the Board finds that the August 2024 NOD did not relate to the March 19, 2024, rating decision, as the claims at issue are completely distinct.

As to the specific issues listed, the Veteran did not state a challenge to anything other than the blanket claims for "Allergic Rhinitis: Under the PACT," and "Chronic Maxillary: Under the PACT." In the January 2024 rating decision, notification of which was sent on January 22, 2024, the Veteran was granted service connection for allergic rhinitis as well as chronic maxillary sinusitis, pursuant to the amendments of the PACT Act. See January 2024, Rating Decision. The Veteran was awarded an effective date of August 24, 2023, for both claims and each was assigned a noncompensable (0 percent) rating. Id. 

It is well understood that the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. However, as the time for appealing the January 2024 rating decision has expired, the Board also finds that the Veteran may be prejudiced by mere dismissal of the claims. Accordingly, the Board liberally construes the August 2024 NOD as appealing the January 2024 rating decision. In addition, as the Veteran identified "Under the PACT," as the issue related to both claims, the Board interprets this as a challenge to the effective date as the effective date assigned was not pursuant to the terms of the PACT Act and liberalizing laws. Accordingly, the Board will review the effective date as the challenged issue to the January 2024 rating decision.

The Board also notes that the Veteran filed a Request for Higher-Level Review, to the January 2024 rating decision. See January 2024, VA Form 20-0996. In that request, the Veteran also addresses a claim for tension headaches, and challenges the rating assigned for that disability as well as the ratings for sinusitis and rhinitis. Id. There is no reference made to the PACT Act, but the date of the January 22, 2024, rating decision is correctly stated. Id. On May 20, 2024, the Veteran was issued a HLR rating decision. The time to appeal the issues addressed within that decision has not yet expired. For the reasons outline above, along with the fact that the NOD identified a rating decision date which pre-dates the May 2024 rating decision, the Board finds that this is not the rating decision on appeal, again noting that the time to file an appeal thereto remains open, should the Veteran wish to appeal any of the issues adjudicated in the May 2024 rating decision. 

Earlier Effective Date - Allergic Rhinitis and Chronis Sinusitis

The Veteran has filed an appeal for "Allergic Rhinitis: Under the PACT," and "Chronic Maxillary: Under the PACT," which the Board is liberally construing as a challenge to the effective dates assigned for the service-connected disabilities of allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis. 

By way of procedural background, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection of chronic sinusitis on May 2, 2019. See May 2019, VA Form 21-526EZ. In a July 2019 rating decision, the claim was denied based upon a finding that the record failed to show the existence of the disability or any relation to the acute sinus treatment received during active service. See July 2019, Rating Decision. The Veteran did not effectuate a review of that decision or initiate an appeal. Accordingly, the July 2019 rating decision became final. 

Following the date of that decision, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, on August 24, 2023. In pertinent part, the Veteran specified that issues for entitlement to service connection for sinusitis and rhinitis as falling "under the PACT Act." See August 2023, VA Form 20-0995. In the January 2024 rating decision on appeal, service connection was granted with an effective date of August 24, 2023, reflecting the date of receipt of the claim. See January 2024, Rating Decision. 

The effective date for the grant of service connection based upon an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase is either the day following separation from active service, or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, it will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b).

In August 2022, the President of the United States signed into law the PACT Act, which became effective on August 10, 2022. See Pub. L. 117-168. VA regulations provide that where a service connection claim is received by VA within one year after a change in law, such as the PACT Act, and all the requirements were met for a grant of service connection on the effective date of the change in law, the proper effective date shall be the date of the change in the law. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a). When, however, a claim is received more than one (1) year following the effective date of a liberalizing law, "...benefits may be authorized for a period of 1 year prior to the date of receipt of such request." See 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a)(3). 

In this case, there is nothing within the record between the dates of enactment of the PACT Act and the filing of the August 24, 2023, VA Form 20-0995, which may be construed as a claim for service connection of the disabilities at issue. 

Nevertheless, the Board recognizes that the eligibility requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a) are preconditions for the 1-year retroactive provision of 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a)(3). To be eligible for a retroactive payment under these provisions, the evidence must show an award or increase of compensation that is granted pursuant to a liberalizing law and the Veteran must have met all eligibility criteria for the liberalized benefit on the effective date of the liberalizing law. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(g); 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a). 

In this regard, the Veteran underwent a VA examination in December 2023 as to the claims for service connection of sinusitis and allergic rhinitis. Based upon an in-person examination along with review of radiology studies conducted in December 2023, the examiner determined that there were diagnoses of allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis. See December 2023, VA Examination Report. Notably, the examiner relied upon a radiology report from December 2023, which indicated a confirmed diagnosis of chronic left maxillary sinusitis. 

In resolving any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that this evidence supports a finding that the Veteran met the eligibility requirements for service connection of allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis on the effective date of the PACT Act and that such eligibility has existed continuously from that date. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114(a). Given the date uncontroverted date of filing of August 24, 2023, and the controlling regulations applicable thereto, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of 1 year prior to the date of receipt of the claim.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively establishes entitlement to an effective date of August 24, 2022, but no earlier, for service connection of allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 776.
