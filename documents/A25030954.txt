ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for left hand condition (middle finger scar) is dismissed.

Entitlement to service connection for back strain (also claimed as back sprain) is dismissed.

Entitlement to a compensable rating for residual scar, right foot, is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for right knee condition is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for left knee condition is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In the May 2024 notice of disagreement, the Veteran indicated that he disagreed with a "deferred" decision as it relates to his claim for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus, which is a non-final, non-appealable agency action.

2. The Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for left hand condition (middle finger scar) stems from an untimely VA Form 10182, without good cause shown to extend the filing deadline.

3. The Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for back strain (also claimed as back sprain) stems from an untimely VA Form 10182, without good cause shown to extend the filing deadline.

4. The Veteran's scar, right foot, measures 6cm by 0.4cm with no evidence of underlying soft tissue damage.

5. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a right knee condition at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

6. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has had a left knee condition at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The January 2024 rating decision notifying of a "deferral" of adjudication for the claim of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus, is a non-final, non-appealable agency action and, therefore, the criteria for dismissal-of an issue not ripe for review-are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.105, 20.204.

2. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for left hand condition (middle finger scar) have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.202, 20.203.

3. The criteria for dismissal of entitlement to service connection for back strain (also claimed as back sprain) have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 511(a), 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500, 20.202, 20.203.

4. The criteria for a compensable disability rating for residual scar, right foot, have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7802.

5. The criteria for service connection for right knee condition are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

6. The criteria for service connection for left knee condition are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served honorably on active duty with the United States Marine Corps from July 1995 to December 1998.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeals from the December 2019 (left hand condition (middle finger scar) and back strain (also claimed as back sprain)), January 2024 (tinnitus, left knee condition, and right knee condition), and February 2024 (residual scar, right foot) rating decisions of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In September 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a July 2019 decision listing the issues as headaches, left and right knee conditions, tinnitus, and left middle finger scar.  In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued a HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of a prior August 2023 decision considering tinnitus, left knee condition, and right knee condition.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 decision relating to tinnitus, left knee condition, and right knee condition and any evidence submitted during an applicable evidentiary window.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 AOJ decision, considering tinnitus, left knee condition, and right knee condition, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2019 (left hand condition (middle finger scar) and back strain (also claimed as back sprain)), and February 2024 (residual scar, right foot) AOJ decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is dismissed.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, notice of disagreement (NOD), the Veteran identified the rating decision on appeal, with regard to the claim for service connection of tinnitus, as September 2023.  The Board notes there is no September 2023 rating decision.  However, the Veteran submitted the September 2023 HLR with regard to the claim for service connection of tinnitus decided in the August 2023 rating decision.  The Higher-Level Reviewer considered the Veteran's claim for service connection of tinnitus, determined that there had been a duty to assist error, and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development. 

The January 2024 rating decision stated a decision on the Veteran's claim for service connection of tinnitus was "deferred" pending further development.  

Therefore, the Board finds, for the claim of entitlement to service connection of tinnitus, the May 2024 VA Form 10182 NOD was premature.  

The Board finds the January 2024 rating decision, as it pertains to the Veteran's claim of service connection for tinnitus included no final, binding agency action.  The Board finds the January 2024 rating decision expressly deferred final adjudication of the claim for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus.  The May 2024 VA Form 10182 NOD was premature, as the January 2024 rating decision, in regard to the claim for service connection of tinnitus, does not constitute a final decision of the issue on appeal.  See Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 462 (2011) ("Because there is no 'final decision' when the RO [regional office] issues a deferred rating decision, there has been no 'adjudicative determination' from which [a] [Notice of Disagreement] can be filed.").

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  As this matter was not ripe for appellate consideration at the time the appellant submitted his NOD, the claim must therefore be DISMISSED.

2. Entitlement to service connection for left hand condition (middle finger scar) is dismissed.

In the May 2024, VA Form 10182 NOD the Veteran gave the date of the decision appealed with regard to "left middle finger scar" as June 2019.  The Board notes that there is no June 2019 rating decision in the evidence of record.  However, there is a December 2019 rating decision that denies entitlement to service connection for a "hand condition, left".

The Board notes the December 2019 rating decision makes the favorable finding the evidence of record shows a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during service, an August 1995 service treatment record (STR) shows complaints of a laceration of right middle finger.  

The Board finds the most recent rating decision in the evidence of record considering a claim for service connection of a "left middle finger scar," is the December 2019 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for "hand condition, left". 

Timely Appeal

Except as provided in the case of simultaneously contested claims, a claimant, or his representative, must file a properly completed notice of disagreement (NOD) with a decision by the RO within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision.  38 U.S.C. § 7105 (b)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.203 (b).  

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees.  38 U.S.C. § 7105 (d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (a).

Where a VA Form 10182, NOD, is not timely filed, the Board may grant an extension of the time to file and accept the VA Form 10182, NOD, as timely, where good cause has been shown.  38 C.F.R. § 20.203 (c).  

However, there is no legal entitlement to an extension of time; rather, 38 C.F.R. § 3.109 (b) leaves the decision to the sole discretion of VA.  See Corry v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 231, 235 (1992).

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims (Court) noted in Hall v. McDonough, although the Board cannot dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, it may dismiss an appeal for a procedural defect.  See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021) (the Board may not dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction but may consider dismissing it for other non-jurisdictional reasons such as a procedural defect.)

VA amended its adjudication regulations on March 24, 2015, to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on standard forms prescribed by the Secretary, regardless of the type of claim or posture in which the particular claim arises.  79 Fed. Reg. 57660 (Sept. 25, 2014).  The amendments, however, are only effective for claims and appeals filed on or after March 24, 2015.

The filing of an alternate form or other communication expressing disagreement with a rating action will not extend, toll, or otherwise delay the time limit for filing a NOD.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (e).  

Analysis

The Board finds the Veteran did not identify an accurate decision date to be appealed in the May 2024 VA Form 10182, NOD.  However, as the Veteran clearly identified the issue of "left middle finger scar", the Board finds the most recent rating decision of record relating to the same disability, is that of the December 2019 rating decision.

The Board finds the May 2024 VA Form 10182 NOD, was submitted well after the year to appeal the December 2019 rating decision.

The Board finds there is no evidence of record that the Veteran requested an extension to appeal the December 2019 rating decision.  Additionally, the Board finds there is no evidence of record that could be interpreted as showing a good cause as to why an extension of time is warranted.  

As set out above, the filing of an alternate form or other communication expressing disagreement with a rating action will not extend, toll, or otherwise delay the time limit for filing a NOD.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202 (e).  Therefore, the Board cannot consider the fully developed claim forms submitted by the Veteran between the December 2019 rating decision and May 2024 VA Form 10182 NOD.  The Board finds that good cause has not been shown to extend the time to file the VA Form 10182 NOD in this matter.

The Board finds it is unclear from the Veteran's actions whether he intended to appeal the December 2019 rating decision.  If the Veteran was attempting to have the AOJ readjudicate a previous claim, this would require submission of a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995).  If the Veteran is making a new claim for service connection of a scar, left middle finger, rather than a left-hand condition, this would require submission of a Fully Developed Claim (VA Form 21-526EZ).    

The Board finds there is no evidence of record the Veteran failed to receive the December 2019 rating decision.  

The Board finds as more than one year expired from the date of notification of the December 2019 rating decision, the May 2024 VA Form 10182 NOD was untimely as to the appeal of entitlement to service connection for left hand condition (middle finger scar). 

As set out above, the Board cannot dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, however, it may dismiss an appeal for a procedural defect.  See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021).  The Veteran's filing of the untimely May 2024, VA Form 10182, NOD, is (1) a procedural defect, and (2) no good cause has been shown to accept the untimely May 2024, VA Form 10182, NOD.  Therefore, the Veteran's claim for service connection of left-hand condition (middle finger scar) is hereby DISMISSED.  38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203.  

3. Entitlement to service connection for back strain (also claimed as back sprain) is dismissed.

In the May 2024, VA Form 10182 NOD, the Veteran gave the date of the decision appealed with regard to "back pain" as September 2023.  The Board notes that there is no September 2023 rating decision in the evidence of record.  However, there is an August 2023 rating decision.  The Board finds the August 2023 rating decision does not contain a decision on a claim of entitlement to service connection for "back pain" or any related condition.

The Board finds the most recent rating decision in the evidence of record considering a claim for service connection of a back condition, is the December 2019 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for back strain (also claimed as back sprain).  

The Board reiterates, as set out in full above, a claimant, or his representative, must file a properly completed notice of disagreement (NOD) with a decision by the RO within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision.  38 U.S.C. § 7105 (b)(1)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 20.203 (b).  The Board may grant an extension of the time to file and accept the VA Form 10182, NOD, as timely, where good cause has been shown.  38 C.F.R. § 20.203 (c).

The Board finds that good cause has not been shown to extend the time to file the VA Form 10182 NOD in this matter.

The Board finds it is unclear from the Veteran's actions whether he intended to appeal the December 2019 rating decision, or if he was attempting to have the AOJ readjudicate a previous claim, which would require submission of a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995).

As set out above, the Board cannot dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, however, it may dismiss an appeal for a procedural defect.  See Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329 (2021).  The Veteran's filing of the untimely May 2024, VA Form 10182 NOD, is (1) a procedural defect, and (2) no good cause has been shown to accept the untimely May 2024, VA Form 10182 NOD.  Therefore, the Veteran's claim for service connection of back strain (also claimed as back sprain) is hereby DISMISSED.  38 U.S.C. § 7105, 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.203.       

4. Entitlement to a compensable rating for residual scar, right foot, is denied.

The Veteran claims entitlement to a compensable rating for service-connected residual scar, right foot. 

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by comparing a veteran's present symptoms with the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based upon average impairment in earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher evaluation is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  After careful consideration of the evidence, any reasonable doubt is resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Board will consider whether separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found, a practice known as 'staged ratings.' Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 126 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is generally to be avoided.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  The critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the disabilities is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other disability.  See Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994). 

Where, entitlement to service connection has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of disability that is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  

In deciding claims, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record on appeal.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a).  Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need to discuss each piece of evidence submitted by the appellant or on his behalf.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claim and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claim.  See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-30 (2000).  

Service-connection for the Veteran's residual scar, right foot, was granted in the August 2023 rating decision as part of the Veteran's service-connected left foot hallux valgus, with a non-compensable disability rating, effective June 6, 2019.  (DC 7802).

The Veteran's residual scar, right foot, is rated in accordance with DC 7802 for Burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.

DC 7802 provides a maximum 10 percent rating for an area or areas of 144 square inches (929 sq. cm.) or greater.

Medical Exam

The October 2023 exam request records the Veteran did not attend the scheduled VA medical exam.  No explanation is provided as to why the Veteran failed to attend the VA medical exam.

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(a), when entitlement to a benefit cannot be established without a current VA examination or reexamination and a claimant, without good cause, fails to report for such examination or reexamination, action shall be taken in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b) or (c) as appropriate.  38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b) applies to original or reopened claims or claims for increase.

More specifically, when a claimant fails to report for a medical examination scheduled in conjunction with any other original claim, a supplemental claim for a benefit which was previously disallowed, or a claim for increase, without good cause, the claim shall be denied.  38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b).

The Board finds that 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(a) is only applicable where entitlement to the benefit sought cannot be established without a VA reexamination.  In the Veteran's case his residual scar, right foot, was examined in the June 2019 VA medical exam.  The Board finds there is no evidence of record to support a more recent change in the Veteran's residual right foot scar.

The Board finds the evidence of record sufficient to establish the Veteran's entitlement to the benefit sought in an increased rating for residual scar, right foot.  Therefore, the Board will proceed to consider the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for service-connected residual scar, right foot.

Factual Background

The June 2019 VA medical exam reviewed the Veteran's record and examined the Veteran in person.  The examiner confirmed the Veteran has a residual scar over the right foot near the right big toe as a result of bunionectomy surgery.  The examiner found the Veteran's scar was not painful or unstable, not located on the head, face, or neck, and not greater than 39 square cm.  The examiner noted the scar was well healed and not tender on exam.  The examiner recorded the Veteran's scar as measuring 6cm by 0.4 cm.  

Analysis

For the reasons set out below, the Board finds the Veteran's residual scar, right foot, more closely approximates a noncompensable rating.

The Board finds the June 2019 VA medical exam competent and credible, completed by an appropriately qualified medical professional following review of the Veteran's record, and an in-person examination.  The Board finds the June 2019 VA medical exam generally consistent with the evidence of record.  The Board affords the June 2019 VA medical exam probative weight.

The Board finds the Veteran's residual scar, right foot, does not involve the head, face, or neck, is not associated with underlying soft tissue damage, and measures 2.4 sq. cm. 

The Board finds the Veteran's residual scar, right foot, does not more closely approximate a compensable disability rating.  The June 2019 VA medical exam found the Veteran's residual scar, right foot, was not painful or unstable.  The June 2019 VA medical exam found the Veteran's residual scar, right foot, was well healed, and not tender on exam.  The June 2019 VA medical exam found the Veteran's residual scar, right foot, was 2.4 sq cm in size.     

The Board finds there is no evidence to support "staged" disability ratings for the period on appeal.  The Board finds the Veteran's disability level remained consistent for the period on appeal.

The Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms are fully contemplated by the assigned noncompensable schedular rating, and the persuasive weight of the evidence is against assigning a compensable rating.  As a result, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the Veteran's claim is adjudicated in accordance with the evidence and the schedular criteria.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; 4.3; 4.7.  

The Board therefore finds that the Veteran's residual scar, right foot, does not more closely approximate a compensable disability rating.  As such, the persuasive weight of the evidence is against the claim and the appeal for a compensable rating for residual scar, right foot, must be hereby DENIED.  38 U.S.C. § 5107.

5. Entitlement to service connection for right knee condition is denied.

The Veteran claims entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship (nexus) between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  See, e.g., Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  38 U.S.C. § 7104 (a); Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of the matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant; however, if the evidence of record is either persuasively for or persuasively against the claim, then the benefit-of-the-doubt rule no longer applies, and the claim is instead adjudicated in accordance with the evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

In deciding claims, it is the Board's responsibility to evaluate the entire record on appeal.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a).  Although the Board has an obligation to provide reasons and bases supporting this decision, there is no need to discuss each piece of evidence submitted by the appellant or on his behalf.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  Rather, the Board's analysis below will focus specifically on what evidence is needed to substantiate the claim and what the evidence in the claims file shows, or fails to show, with respect to the claim.  See Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122, 128-30 (2000). 

A VA examination is required when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service, or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, but (4) there is insufficient competent medical evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). See also 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d)(2), 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4)(i).  The third prong, which requires that the evidence of record "indicate" that the claimed disability or symptoms "may be" associated with the established event, is a low threshold. McLendon, 20 Vet. App. at 83.  When the VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).

Factual Background

In the August 2022 fully developed claim the Veteran claimed entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition.  The Veteran stated that due to the constant humps he has knee pain.  

In the September 2023 fully developed claim the Veteran claimed entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition.  The Veteran stated that during his time at Camp Lejeune he was exposed to extreme marching and 14-mile humps that caused his feet, lower back, and knees to be injured.  

 Analysis

The Board finds, for the reasons set out below, the evidence of record does not reflect a current disability of a right knee condition, a related disability, or recurrent symptoms of a disability.  The Board finds the evidence of record does not show an event, injury, or disease occurred in service.  The Board finds in the absence of competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, there is no requirement the Veteran be afforded a VA medical exam.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  Further, the Board finds in the absence of a current disability there can be no entitlement to service connection.

The Board finds the evidence of record contains no complaints of right knee pain either in the Veteran's VA treatment records or service treatment records (STR). The Board notes the Veteran states he has right knee pain in the August 2022 and September 2023 claims for service connection.  The Board finds the Veteran competent to report his observable symptoms such as pain.  However, the Board finds this is the only evidence the Veteran has made any complaint of knee pain during active-duty service or since separation.  The Board finds the Veteran's statements inconsistent with the evidence of record.  The Veteran provides no reason why he has never sought any medical treatment for his knee pain, or why he has waited over 20 years to make a claim for service connection.  The Board affords the Veteran's statements of experiencing knee pain, contained in the August 2022 and September 2023 fully developed claim for service connection no probative weight.        

In the absence of proof of a present disability of a right knee condition, or a related disability, there can be no valid claim for service connection.  See Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, supra.  Therefore, as the evidence of record persuasively shows the Veteran did not have competent evidence of a current right knee condition or persistent or recurrent symptoms of right knee pain, at any time during the appellate period, the Board concludes that service connection is not warranted, and no further discussion of the remaining elements is necessary.  See Watson v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 309, 314 (1993) ("A determination of service connection requires a finding of the existence of a current disability and a determination of a relationship between that disability and an injury or a disease incurred in service."); see also Coburn v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 427, 431 (2006) (finding that the absence of any one element will result in denial-of-service connection).

Accordingly, the evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran did not have any current disabilities related to a right knee condition, at any time during the appeal period, and therefore, the Board must deny this service connection claim and need not reach any further discussion related to either the "in-service incurrence" or "nexus" elements in this case.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Brammer, supra.  The Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim.  As a result, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply, and the Veteran's claim is adjudicated in accordance with the evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

The Veteran's claim for service connection for right knee condition, is not warranted by the persuasive weight of the evidence.  The persuasive weight of the evidence is against the claim.  Thus, the Veteran's appeal must hereby be DENIED.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

6. Entitlement to service connection for left knee condition is denied. 

The Veteran claims entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition.

As set out above, in order to establish service connection, including requiring the VA to provide the Veteran with a medical examination, there must be evidence of a current disability.

Factual Background

In the August 2022 fully developed claim the Veteran claimed entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition.  The Veteran stated that due to the constant humps he has knee pain.  

In the September 2023 fully developed claim the Veteran claimed entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition.  The Veteran stated that during his time at Camp Lejeune he was exposed to extreme marching and 14-mile humps that caused his feet, lower back, and knees to be injured.  

 Analysis

The Board finds, for the reasons set out below, the evidence of record does not reflect a current disability of a left knee condition, a related disability, or recurrent symptoms of a disability.  The Board finds the evidence of record does not show an event, injury, or disease occurred in service.  The Board finds in the absence of competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, there is no requirement the Veteran be afforded a VA medical exam.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).  Further, the Board finds in the absence of a current disability there can be no entitlement to service connection.
