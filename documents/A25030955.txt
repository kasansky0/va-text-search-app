REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty with the U.S. Navy from September 2008 to June 2010 and from February 2012 to January 2013. The Veteran had additional service with the Naval Reserves. 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 (elbow, upper back, and knee) and March 2024 (diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, anemia, and soft tissue mass) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Iron Deficiency Anemia with Chronic Blood loss

The Veteran contends that his anemia is related to toxic exposure during service, or chronic blood loss from hemorrhoids. 

Favorable findings from the March 2024 Rating Decision include a confirmed diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia and participation in a TERA. The February 2024 VA hematologic and lymphatic conditions examination noted iron deficiency anemia and chronic blood loss in 2020. 

In a February 2024 VA TERA opinion, the examiner opined that the claimed condition was less likely than not caused by the indicated toxic exposure activities. The examiner's rationale was that there was nothing in the Veteran's records that shows he was exposed to toxins that lead to his claimed anemia. Rather, his anemia is most likely due to the blood loss from rectal bleeding. The Board finds the February 2024 VA medical opinion inadequate to decide the claim. In that regard, the examiner did not provide adequate supporting rationale for the conclusions reached and did not provide an opinion for direct service connection. This opinion is therefore afforded little, if any, probative weight.

Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Veteran should be afforded a new VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of his anemia. The AOJ's failure to obtain an adequate etiology opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error that necessitates a remand for development.

2. Soft Tissue Mass, Right Scapula

The Veteran contends that his soft tissue mass, right scapula, is related to toxic exposure during service. 

Favorable findings from the March 2024 Rating Decision include a confirmed diagnosis of a soft tissue mass located at the right scapula and participation in a TERA. The February 2024 VA skin diseases examination noted a diagnosis of soft tissue mass, right scapula. In a February 2024 VA opinion, the examiner opined that the claimed condition was less likely than not caused by the indicated toxic exposure activities. The examiner's rationale was that there was nothing in the Veteran's records that shows he was exposed to toxins that led to the development of a soft tissue mass, right scapula. The Board finds the February 2024 VA medical opinion inadequate to decide the claim. In that regard, the examiner did not provide adequate supporting rationale for the conclusions reached and did not provide an opinion for direct service connection. This opinion is therefore afforded little, if any, probative weight.

Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Veteran should be afforded a new VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of his soft tissue mass, right scapula. The AOJ's failure to obtain an adequate etiology opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error that necessitates a remand for development.

3. Hemorrhoids

The Veteran contends that his hemorrhoids are related to exposure to toxins in service. 

Favorable findings from the March 2024 Rating Decision include a confirmed diagnosis of hemorrhoids and participation in a TERA. During the February 2024 VA rectum and anus conditions examination, the Veteran reported that he was diagnosed with hemorrhoids following a colonoscopy procedure for his anemia in 2020. He underwent a hemorrhoidectomy in 2021. On physical examination during the February 2024 VA rectum and anus conditions examination, the Veteran was found to have three hemorrhoids on the right anal side, that were mild to moderate in size, non-bleeding and soft. 

In a February 2024 VA opinion, the examiner opined that the claimed condition was less likely than not caused by the indicated toxic exposure activities, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities. The examiner's rationale was that there was nothing in the Veteran's records that shows he was exposed to toxins that led to his claimed hemorrhoids. The Board finds the February 2024 VA medical opinion inadequate to decide the claim. In that regard, the examiner did not provide adequate supporting rationale for the conclusions reached and did not provide an opinion for direct service connection. This opinion is therefore afforded little, if any, probative weight.

Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Veteran should be afforded a new VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of his hemorrhoids. The AOJ's failure to obtain an adequate etiology opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error that necessitates a remand for development.

4. Diverticulosis of the Large Intestine

The Veteran contends that his diverticulosis is related to exposure to toxins in service. 

Favorable findings from the March 2024 Rating Decision include a confirmed diagnosis of diverticulosis and participation in a TERA. During the February 2024 VA intestinal conditions examination, the examiner noted a diagnosis of diverticulosis of the large intestine after a colonoscopy in 2020. A December 2022 VA memo confirmed the Veteran served in Iraq in 2010 and Bahrain in 2012, and therefore, met the definition of a Persian Gulf Veteran and satisfied the criteria for presumptive toxic exposure. 

In a February 2024 VA opinion, the examiner opined that the claimed diverticulosis was less likely than not caused by the indicated toxic exposure activities, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. The examiner's rationale was that diverticulosis is thought to occur due to peristalsis abnormalities, intestinal dyskinesia, or high segmental intraluminal pressures, with some environmental and lifestyle risk factors, including a diet low in fiber and high in red meat. The examiner found that diverticulosis is unrelated to toxic environmental exposures, such as dust storms, vehicle exhaust, construction sites, farming, and emissions from local industries. The February 2024 VA examiner explained the reasons for the conclusions based on an accurate characterization of the evidence, and her opinion is entitled to substantial probative weight. 

The Board finds the February 2024 VA medical opinion inadequate to decide the claim. In that regard, the examiner did not provide adequate supporting rationale for the conclusions reached and did not provide an opinion for direct service connection. This opinion is therefore afforded little, if any, probative weight.

Accordingly, the Board concludes that the Veteran should be afforded a new VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of his diverticulosis. The AOJ's failure to obtain an adequate etiology opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error that necessitates a remand for development.

5. Left Elbow, Left Upper Back, and Right Knee Pain

The Veteran contends that he developed a left elbow and upper back conditions as a result of his service. In his August 2023 claim, the Veteran reported injuring his elbow during his tour in Iraq, and his upper back pain was due to constant movement and activity in service. The Veteran contends that he injured his right knee during his tour in Iraq. 

There are no favorable findings from the February 2024 Rating Decision as it pertained to the claimed left elbow and upper back. The favorable finding from the February 2024 Rating Decision indicates the Veteran had a diagnosis of right knee sprain and lateral meniscus tear. Review of private treatment records show the Veteran suffered an injury while exercising in August 2023 and was treated with rest, pain medication, and a knee brace. 

VA's duty to assist includes a duty to provide a medical examination or obtain a medical opinion where it is deemed necessary to make a decision on the claim. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d) (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159 (c)(4) (2019); Duenas v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 512 (2004); Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that a lay person is competent to report a contemporaneous medical diagnosis), McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006). For below noted reasons, the Board finds that a VA examination is necessary in order to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed disorders.

The Veteran alleges that he suffers from left elbow, left upper back, and right knee disorders that manifest in pain. The Board is cognizant of the holding in Saunders, namely, that pain itself can constitute a disability. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Here, similarly to Saunders, the Veteran has demonstrated that his left elbow, left upper back, and right knee disorders symptoms result in an impairment of earning capacity or other functional impairment. As such, Saunders is applicable to the case currently before the Board. 

The Veteran has not yet been afforded a VA examination to determine the etiology of his claimed peripheral neuropathy of the extremities. Therefore, on remand, such an examination with an opinion should be obtained. The AOJ's failure to obtain an adequate etiology opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error that necessitates a remand for development.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate medical examiner and obtain an etiology opinion to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed iron deficiency anemia with chronic blood loss. The need for physical examination or telehealth evaluation is left to the discretion of the medical professional offering the medical opinion. The record must be made available to the examiner for review, and the examiner should indicate that the record was reviewed in connection with the examination. All indicated tests and studies should be accomplished and the findings then reported in detail.

The examiner should respond to the following question:

Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that any currently present iron deficiency anemia with chronic blood loss had its onset during the Veteran's active service, or is otherwise etiologically related to such service, to include his in-service exposure to the environmental hazards in Southwest Asia (notwithstanding the fact that there may not be a presumed association)? The examiner must consider the Veteran's lay statements regarding the onset and continuity of his symptoms.

A rationale should be provided for all opinions offered. If it is not possible to provide a specific opinion regarding the above questions, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).

The medical opinion must support the conclusions reached with an analysis that is adequate to consider and weigh against other evidence of record; medical opinions must contain not only clear conclusions with supporting data, but also a reasoned medical explanation connecting the two. If an opinion cannot be expressed without resort to speculation, ensure that the clinician so indicates and discusses why an opinion is not possible, to include whether there is additional evidence that could enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge.

2. Then, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate medical examiner and obtain an etiology to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed soft tissue mass, right scapula. The need for physical examination or telehealth evaluation is left to the discretion of the medical professional offering the medical opinion. The record must be made available to the examiner for review, and the examiner should indicate that the record was reviewed in connection with the examination. All indicated tests and studies should be accomplished and the findings then reported in detail.

4. Then, schedule the Veteran for a VA examination with an appropriate medical examiner and obtain an etiology opinion to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed diverticulosis of large intestine. The need for physical examination or telehealth evaluation is left to the discretion of the medical professional offering the medical opinion.

Board of Veterans' Appeals

Attorney for the Board	A. Price Umaru, Esq.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
