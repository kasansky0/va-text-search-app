REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus with degenerative arthritis is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1995 to October 1998. This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral pes planus with degenerative arthritis is remanded.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in June 2023 where the examiner provided a negative nexus opinion. In this opinion, they mentioned that they were unable to find the Veteran's separation examination in the claims file. A careful review of the claims file confirms that that examination is missing. There is also no indication whether the Veteran waived his separation examination, as the entirety of the Veteran's military personnel records are also missing. VA has a duty to assist claimants to obtain evidence needed to substantiate a claim, which includes making as many requests as are necessary to obtain relevant records from a Federal department or agency, including military personnel records. 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (2012); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(2); Bell v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 611, 613 (1992). Accordingly, a pre-decisional duty to assist error has been identified, and remand is required.

By this remand the Board makes no determination, expressed or implied, concerning the credibility of any statements on file.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain the Veteran's service treatment records, to include the separation examination, and his military personnel records. If any requested records are not available, or the search for any such records otherwise yields negative results, that fact must clearly be documented in the claims file. Efforts to obtain these records must continue until it is determined that they do not exist or that further attempts to obtain them would be futile. The non-existence or unavailability of such records must be verified and this should be documented for the record. Required notice must be provided to the Veteran and his or her representative.
