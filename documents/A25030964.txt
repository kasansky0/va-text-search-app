DOCKET NO. 240722-456542
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

The request for a correction of payment (or "audit of benefits") is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. In a June 2024 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) granted entitlement to aid and attendance benefits for the Appellant, effective April 2023.

2. In a July 2024 VA Form 10182, the Appellant did not express disagreement with either the amount or the effective date of the award established in the June 2024 rating decision; rather, the Appellant indicated that she had not received payment of the award from January 2024 through June 2024. 

3. To date, the AOJ has not conducted an audit of the Appellant's benefits or notified the Appellant of the results of such an audit. 

4. Since the Appellant has not expressed disagreement with a decision by the AOJ, there is no question of law or fact presently before the Board. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Board lacks jurisdiction over the request for an audit of benefits.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 1974 to February 1976.  Sadly, the Veteran passed away in April 2023.  The Appellant in this matter is the Veteran's surviving spouse. 

1. The request for a correction of payment (or "audit of benefits")

As a matter of background, following the Veteran's death, the Appellant submitted an application for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC).  As a result of that application, in a June 2024 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) awarded, in pertinent part, entitlement to aid and attendance allowance for the Appellant, effective April 1, 2023.  

In July 2024, the Appellant submitted, in unison, a VA Form 20-0996 (Request for Higher-Level Review), a VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement), and a VA Form 20-0995 (Supplemental Claim Application).  On each of these forms, the Appellant indicated that she had not received payment for the period from January 2024 through June 2024.  

The Board first wishes to emphasize that these three forms are all used to initiate an appeal of a decision by the AOJ.  However, only one form of appeal may be exercised at one time.  

A Supplemental Claim Action is used to initiate a review of a previous decision at the AOJ when the claimant has new and relevant evidence to submit.  

A Higher-Level Review is used when, within one year of a decision by the AOJ, the claimant wants that decision reviewed by a higher-level adjudicator at the AOJ, based solely on the evidence that was in the record at the time of the decision on appeal.  

A Notice of Disagreement is used when, within one year of a decision by the AOJ, the claimant wants that decision escalated to a review by the Board.  

In this case, the matter was docketed to the Board, based on receipt of the VA Form 10182.  As a result, the AOJ did not proceed with either the Supplemental Claim Application or the Higher-Level Review.  

Importantly, however, it does not appear that the Appellant is in disagreement with any AOJ decision.  Indeed, the Appellant has not expressed any disagreement with either the amount of benefits awarded by the June 2024 rating decision or with the effective date of those benefits.  

Rather, it appears that the relief the Appellant seeks is an audit of benefits-specifically as she alleges that she did not receive benefits for the period from January 2024 through June 2024.  Based upon the available evidence, the AOJ has not performed an audit or issued an appealable decision on that issue.  In other words, the Board cannot take up this issue of its own volition.  The Board is an appellate body and may only address decisions that have already been made by the AOJ or are otherwise assigned to its jurisdiction by statute.  

The Appellant may request an audit of benefits directly with the AOJ by contacting the Veterans Benefits Administration or contacting the VA benefits hotline for additional information.  If, after the AOJ conducts an audit, the Appellant is dissatisfied with the audit, she may then appeal the results of the audit using one of the form options discussed above, to include submitting a VA Form 10182 to appeal to the Board.

At the present time, however, as it stands, there is no question of law or fact presently before the Board.  Therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction of the Veteran's appeal.  38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105;?38 C.F.R. § 20.104.  As there is no question of law or fact before the Board, the appeal in this matter must be dismissed.  Id.
