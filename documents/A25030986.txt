ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of June 25, 2018, for a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is granted. 

Entitlement to an earlier effective date of June 25, 2018, for basic eligibility to Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. As of June 25, 2018, the Veteran's service-connected disabilities precluded him from securing and maintaining substantially gainful employment.

2. As of June 25, 2018, the Veteran met the criteria for a grant of entitlement to a TDIU and establishment of DEA. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of June 25, 2018, for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU are met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 3.400, 4.3, 4.16.

2. The criteria for an effective date of June 25, 2018, for the establishment of DEA are met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.3, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 1971 to October 1971. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to a TDIU prior to February 1, 2019.

The Veteran asserts entitlement to an effective date for a TDIU prior to February 1, 2019. Upon a review of the record, the Board finds that an effective date of June 25, 2018, for the grant of a TDIU is warranted.

A TDIU is granted upon a showing the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due solely to impairment resulting from his service-connected disability or disabilities. See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16, 4.18, 4.19. A TDIU may be assigned where the veteran is rated at 60 percent or more for a single service-connected disability or rated at 70 percent for two or more service-connected disabilities and at least one disability is rated at least at 40 percent, and when the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of the service-connected disability or disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

Marginal employment shall not be considered substantially gainful employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). Factors to be considered are the veteran's education and employment history and loss of work-related functions due to pain. Ferraro v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 326, 330, 332 (1991). Individual unemployability must be determined without regard to any nonservice-connected disabilities or the veteran's advancing age. 38 C.F.R. § 3.341(a); see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.19 (age may not be a factor in evaluating service-connected disability or unemployability); Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361, 363 (1993). The fact that a veteran may be unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not determinative. The ultimate question is whether the veteran, because of service-connected disability, is incapable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he can find employment. Van Hoose, 4 Vet. App. at 363.

If a Veteran does not meet the schedular rating requirements, a TDIU may be granted on an extra-schedular basis under § 4.16(b) if the Veteran is deemed incapable of obtaining and maintaining substantially gainful employment on account of service-connected disability or disabilities. 

For purposes of effective date rules, the issue of entitlement to a TDIU may be considered as part of a claim for underlying benefits (i.e., a service connection claim) or may be considered part of an increased compensation claim (i.e., in conjunction with an increased evaluation claim or as a freestanding claim to obtain an increased evaluation based on unemployability). See Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-54 (2009); Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 32-34 (2007).

The effective date of an award of a TDIU will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1). The effective date of an award of a TDIU may, however, be established at the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability causing unemployability had occurred, if the application for a TDIU is received within one year from that date. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2).

Thus, determining an appropriate effective date for an increased rating under the effective date regulations involves an analysis of the evidence to determine (1) when a claim for a TDIU was received and, if possible, (2) when the increase in disability causing unemployability actually occurred. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400(o)(2).

In the instant case, in terms of procedural history, on June 25, 2018, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 21-526b seeking an increased evaluation for service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). An August 2018 rating decision proposed a decrease from 70 percent disabling to 50 percent disabling for service-connected PTSD, and a November 2019 rating decision put such proposed reduction into effect on February 1, 2019. The Veteran subsequently filed a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) in February 2019. The VA issued a February 2020 Statement of the Case (SOC), and a February 2020 rating decision reinstated a rating of 70 percent for service-connected PTSD effective February 1, 2019. The Veteran subsequently filed a VA Form 9 appealing the claim to the Board in March 2020. In May 2020, the appeal was certified to the Board in a VA Form 8, and the VA issued a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC). A Board hearing was held on April 27, 2022. In a March 2024 decision, the Board denied entitlement to a rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD but granted a TDIU. The Board found that the Veteran's claim for a TDIU was implicitly raised by the record and was considered part-and-parcel of the higher rating claim on appeal. See Rice, 22 Vet. App. at 453-55. A March 2024 rating decision effectuated the Board's grant of a TDIU and assigned an effective date of February 1, 2019. The Veteran subsequently filed an April 2024 VA Form 10182 appealing the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date for TDIU to the Board. Based upon the Veteran's continuous pursuit of entitlement to an increased rating for PTSD, and that the Board previously found the Veteran's claim for a TDIU to be part-and-parcel of the increased rating claim for service-connected PTSD, the Board finds that the period on appeal begins on June 25, 2018. Therefore, the Board shall consider the evidence of record beginning June 25, 2018, to determine the earliest date in which a grant of TDIU is warranted. 

Turning to the evidence of record, June 2017 VA treatment records show that, over the past two weeks, the Veteran reported feeling nervous, anxious or on edge nearly every day, not being able to stop or control worrying nearly every day, worrying too much about different things nearly every day, trouble relaxing nearly every day, feeling restless nearly every day, becoming easily annoyed or irritable nearly every day and afraid as if something awful might happen nearly every day.

August 2017 VA treatment records show that, according to a patient health questionnaire, the Veteran reported little interest or pleasure for several days, feeling down, depressed or hopeless for several days, tired and low energy for several days, trouble concentrating nearly every day and motor retardation nearly every day over the past two weeks. The Veteran further reported that he could not work because "people irritate [him] too much." Treatment records further show that the Veteran had not worked since 2005. Additionally, the Veteran reported isolating at home.

An August 2018 VA examination for PTSD found that the Veteran experienced occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. The Veteran's psychiatric symptoms included depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss such as forgetting names, directions or recent events, difficulty establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a worklike setting. In terms of occupational history, the Veteran reported that he was not currently working. He last worked for the school board from 1991 to 1992 but had not worked steadily since then. The Veteran further reported that he preferred to stay home. He reported being constantly alert and on guard and stated that he wakes in the middle of the night to walk the perimeter of his home. He further reported that he usually sleeps during the day and spends most of the night awake because he does not feel safe. He endorsed a startle response, irritability, and mild anhedonia, but denied verbal or physical aggression. The Veteran also had nightmares, flashbacks and intrusive memories of his time in Vietnam. He doesn't like being around a lot of people and admitted that he feels sad "most of the time." The Veteran also stated that he feels hopeless about his inability to work, and he feels like his symptoms are not going to get any better.

August 2018 VA treatment records show that the Veteran was unemployed, but he had done stocking work in the past. The Veteran also reported that he was continuing to struggle with his PTSD. He reported fluctuating moods, fluctuating energy levels, anger outbursts, nightmares, and difficulty being around others as he expressed that he is concerned that others are against him. He reported poor sleep patterns with difficulty remaining asleep. He discussed that he would get up in the night and "walk the perimeter." He reported that he was seeing a psychiatrist in the   community three years ago but denied any medications. The Veteran reported that his anger outbursts prevent him from being able to maintain employment. He stated that they are not frequent but are significant when they occur. He discussed an event that took place while he was working at a carwash and that it took a significant amount of time for his significant other to calm him.

September 2018 VA treatment records show that the Veteran reported feeling anger due to stress. He also reported that he allows things to build up and then he explodes. He discussed that he was having flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, was on edge, had difficulty regulating anger and was hypervigilant. The Veteran discussed difficulty sleeping and that he was focused daily on the memory of when others in his unit placed a "hit" on him. He had difficulty with others and did better emotionally when his fiancé is with him as she is a calming influence on him.

January 2019 VA treatment records show that the Veteran described his PTSD symptoms to include flashbacks, hypervigilance, panic attacks, irritability, a quick temper, and isolative behaviors. The Veteran reported that he typically sleeps well but will have nightmares about his time in combat and that occasionally such nightmares are so vivid that it will take him days to recover.

Upon a review of the record, the Board finds that an effective date of June 25, 2018, for the grant of a TDIU is warranted. As an initial matter, a TDIU may be assigned where the veteran is rated at 60 percent or more for a single service-connected disability. During the period on appeal, the Veteran's service-connected PTSD has been rated at 70 percent disabling. Therefore, the Veteran meets the schedular requirements for a grant of TDIU during the period on appeal. 

Regarding the economic component of a TDIU, the evidence of record reflects that the Veteran has not been employed since 2005. See August 2017 VA Treatment Records and August 2018 VA Examination. Thus, the Veteran meets the economic component for a grant of a TDIU during the period on appeal. 

Regarding the non-economic component of a TDIU, the Board finds that, during the entire period on appeal, the Veteran was unable to secure and maintain substantially gainful employment due to his service-connected disabilities. The evidence of record shows the Veteran's isolative behaviors, his irritability, and general dislike of, being around others as well as difficulty establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. See August 2017, August 2018, and January 2019 VA Treatment Records; see also August 2018 VA Examination. Such symptoms would likely preclude employment in a collaborative work setting involving regular communication with coworkers or in a customer service setting involving regular interaction with the public. Further, in August 2018 treatment records, the Veteran reported an instance in which he had an angry outburst while working at a car wash and that it took a significant amount of time for him to calm down. This evidence suggests that, during the period on appeal, the Veteran's anger outbursts would have caused significant work stoppages, impacting the Veteran's overall work productivity and ability to maintain employment.

The evidence of record also noted the Veteran's chronic sleep impairment. The Veteran reported sleeping very little at night and sleeping during the day as his hypervigilance at night tends to keep him awake. The Veteran's lack of sleep would likely cause daytime hypersomnolence, as demonstrated by his sleeping during the day and low energy levels, which would ultimately impact his ability to focus and concentrate during a regular workday. See August 2017 and August 2018 VA Treatment Records. Relatedly, the August 2018 VA examination noted mild memory loss and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a worklike setting, which would also limit the Veteran's ability to complete work-related tasks in a timely manner as required by all types of employment. 

Therefore, during the period on appeal, the Board finds that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms significantly limited his ability to perform the tasks required of both sedentary and non-sedentary work. As noted above, the Veteran's irritability, inability to be around or collaborate with others, and angry outbursts precluded employment in both a sedentary office setting as well as a more labor-intensive, non-sedentary setting. Relatedly, the Veteran's chronic sleep impairment paired with his low energy levels, distrust of others, and inability to adapt to work-related stress would prevent the productivity necessary to maintain employment in any worklike setting. 

Based upon the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran's service-connected disability prevents him from securing and maintaining substantially gainful employment as of June 25, 2018, which was the day the Veteran submitted his claim for an increased rating for service-connected PTSD. As the Board has found that the Veteran's claim for a TDIU was part-and-parcel of the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for service-connected PTSD, and the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms precluded the Veteran from securing and following substantially gainful employment during the entire period on appeal, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of June 28, 2018, for the grant of a TDIU is warranted.

2. Entitlement to DEA prior to February 1, 2019.

The Veteran seeks an earlier effective date for DEA benefits pursuant to Chapter 35, Title 38 of the United States Code. The Veteran was awarded eligibility to DEA on the basis that he had a permanent and total service-connected disability permanent in nature. Upon a review of the record, the Board finds that an earlier effective date of June 25, 2018, for DEA benefits is warranted.

Basic eligibility for Chapter 35 benefits is established in one of several ways: (1) the veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death; or (4) the veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.

In this case the Veteran is alive and thus the effective date of the award of DEA basic eligibility is dependent on the Veteran having a permanent and total service-connected disability. As noted above, the Board has determined that the Veteran is entitled to a total service-connected rating on a schedular basis, permanent in nature, since June 25, 2018. As such, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to an earlier effective date of June 25, 2018, for basic eligibility of DEA under 35 U.S.C., Chapter 35.
