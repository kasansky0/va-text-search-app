ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hypercholesterolemia is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for lymphomas is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a disability manifested by blood clot(s) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Hypercholesterolemia is a laboratory finding and not a disease or disability under VA law and regulations.

2. The evidence of record does not reflect that the appellant has had a diagnosis of any disease or cancer associated with lymphomas at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

3. The evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the appellant's disability manifested by blood clot(s) had its onset in or otherwise etiologically related to his military service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hypercholesterolemia are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for lymphomas are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

3. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for blood clot(s) are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The appellant had active service in the United States Navy from October 1984 to October 1988.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 Higher-Level Review (HLR) of a January 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Benefits Administration (the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ)), which denied service connection for blood clot(s), hypercholesterolemia, and lymphomas.  In March 2024, the appellant submitted a notice of disagreement (NOD (via VA Form 10182)), appealing February 2024 HLR rating decision to the Board, and requesting Direct Review by a Veterans Law Judge.  

Evidentiary Window

As the appellant selected the Direct Review Docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of its decision on the issue(s) on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 301. The Board will not consider evidence received after the AOJ decision unless the claimant files a timely request for a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the NOD (VA Form 10182). 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The appellant has not filed such a request. If additional evidence was submitted after the AOJ decision, the Board will not consider it. If the appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the appellant may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. See also Cook v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 175 (2023).  However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for thrombosis (claimed as blood clot(s)), any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Service Connection, Generally

Generally, to establish a direct service connection claim a veteran must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1164, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may also be granted for any injury or disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease or injury was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

1. Entitlement to service connection for hypercholesterolemia is denied.

The appellant contends that service connection is warranted for his hypercholesterolemia. 

VA awards service connection for disabilities. See, e.g., 38 U.S.C. § 1110. Hypercholesterolemia is laboratory finding and is not a disability for VA compensation purposes. See 61 Fed. Reg. 20440 (May 7, 1996) (stating, regarding hyperlipidemia, elevated triglycerides, and elevated cholesterol, that such "are actually laboratory test results, and are not, in and of themselves, disabilities"). As it is not a disability for VA compensation purposes, service connection is not warranted for hypercholesterolemia.

As such, the criteria for service connection for hypercholesterolemia are not met and the appellant's claim is therefore denied. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

2. Entitlement to service connection for lymphomas is denied.

The appellant contends that service connection is warranted for lymphomas.

While the appellant is competent to describe any symptoms associated with lymphomas, VA treatment records do not reflect complaints of or treatment for lymphomas during the pendency of the appeal. Accordingly, the Board concludes that the appellant does not have and has not had a lymphoma disability at any time during the pendency of the claim or recent to the filing of the claim. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013) (holding when the record contains a recent diagnosis of disability prior to a veteran filing a claim for benefits based on that disability, the report of diagnosis is relevant evidence that the Board must address in determining whether a current disability existed at the time the claim was filed or during its pendency); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007) (finding a requirement of a current disability is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim and that a claimant may be granted service connection even though the disability resolves prior to the Secretary's adjudication of the claim). No lymphoma symptoms were reported or diagnosed during active service. There is no evidence in the claims file that a lymphoma disability has been diagnosed post-service. 

The Board acknowledges that the appellant's conceded non-deployment military occupational specialty exposure to asbestos as a Boatswain's Mate qualifies as a Toxic Exposure Risk Activities (TERA). See VA Memorandum, February 21, 2024. However, in November 2023, the appellant was afforded a VA examination, and no diagnosis was noted. See VA Hematologic and Lymphatic Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ), November 28, 2023. The clinician opined "The claimed condition was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activity(ies), after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the veteran. There is no pathology to warrant a diagnosis or condition that can be related to the claimed toxic exposure." See VA Medical Opinion DBQ, November 28, 2023.

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for service connection and VA disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 1131. Evidence must show that the veteran had the disability for which benefits are being claimed. Here, the evidence does not reflect that the appellant had any lymphoma disability at any point during the appeal period. Additionally, there is no indication the appellant had symptoms of the condition that caused him any functional impairment of earning capacity. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Therefore, the Board cannot grant the claim under any theory of entitlement.

While the application for service connection for lymphoma illustrates the appellant believes he has a lymphoma disability, however, he is not competent to provide a diagnosis in this case. The issue is medically complex as it requires the interpretation of diagnostic medical testing. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (2007). 

The Board does not question the appellant's sincerity in his belief that service connection is warranted for lymphomas. However, without evidence of lymphomas or symptoms causing functional impairment of earning capacity, the evidence is persuasively against the claim. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for lymphoma is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

3. Entitlement to service connection for blood clot(s) is denied.

The appellant contends that service connection for blood clots is warranted. 

However, the evidence of record does not support a finding that the appellant's post-service blood clot(s) had its onset in or otherwise etiologically related to his military service. 

Thorough review of the evidence of record revealed no treatment for or reports of blood clots during the appellant's military service. Post-service treatment records reflect that the appellant underwent a thrombectomy in June 2018.  See VA Treatment Records, June 28, 2018. The record reflects that the appellant reported having chest pains during sex, admitted to taking an erectile dysfunction medication, and was found to have a thrombus in one of his blood vessels. Id.

At the time of the manifestation until the time of the rating decision on appeal, the appellant was not service-connected for any disability. The remote onset of the blood clot (to the extent that the appellant has blood clots) is unrelated ot his military service. In January 2024, the appellant was afforded a VA examination. See VA Artery and Vein DBQ, November 28, 2023. The clinician noted "For the claimant's claimed condition of blood clot(s) there is no diagnosis because there are no findings, signs and or symptoms to support a diagnosis." Id. The clinician opined, "The claimed condition was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activity(ies), after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the veteran.  There is no pathology to warrant a diagnosis or condition that can be related to the claimed toxic exposure." See VA Medical Opinion DBQ, November 28, 2023.  

The Board does not question the appellant's sincerity in his belief that service connection is warranted for blood clots. However, without evidence of blood clot or symptoms causing functional impairment of earning capacity, the evidence is persuasively against the claim. 

As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for lymphoma is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, supra.
