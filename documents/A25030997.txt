ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for depressive disorder with anxious distress is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a statement received in August 2024, prior to a decision being promulgated by the Board on the Veteran's service connection claim, he indicated his desire to withdraw his appeal regarding the claim.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal as to the issue of service connection for depressive disorder with anxious distress have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(5); 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from February 1998 to January 2003.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a July 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In a July 2024 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran elected the direct review docket.

Entitlement to service connection for depressive disorder with anxious distress is dismissed.

The claimant or the claimant's representative may withdraw an appeal as to any or all issues on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.204(a).  Except for appeals withdrawn on the record at a hearing, withdrawal must be in writing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.204(b)(1).  A withdrawal is effective when received provided that receipt is prior to the issuance of a decision by the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 20.204(b)(3).  A written withdrawal request is effective where it includes (i) the name of the appellant, (ii) the file number, and (iii) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  38 C.F.R. § 20.204(b).  Withdrawal of a claim constitutes a withdrawal of the NOD.  38 C.F.R. § 20.204(c).  There is no obligation to proceed with further adjudication following withdrawal.  Hanson v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 29 (1996).

In an August 2024 communication, the Veteran indicated that he wanted to withdraw from appeal the psychiatric disorder service connection claim.  The communication contained the Veteran's name, file number, and signature, as well.  The withdrawal effectively meets the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 20.204.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees.  Consequently, dismissal of the pending appeal is the appropriate disposition.  See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d).  Accordingly, further action by the Board concerning the claim is not warranted, and the appeal of the claim is dismissed.  Id.
