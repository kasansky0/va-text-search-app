ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date of December 1, 2021, for a 30 percent rating for migraine headaches is granted.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Throughout the period on appeal, the Veteran has reported an identical disability picture, for which the AOJ has assigned a 30 percent rating.   

2. The Veteran has continuously pursued this claim since December 1, 2021. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an earlier effective date of December 1, 2021, and no earlier, for a 30 percent for migraine headaches, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5110 (a), 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i), 3.2500, Diagnostic Code 8100. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from March 1991 to August 1994.  This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 Higher Level Review (HLR) decision rating decision issued by an agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).

In his VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD), the Veteran elected the Direct Review option. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. §20.301. The HLR decision on appeal here considered the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 rating decision. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2601, 20.301.

A claim for a finding of total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is not inferred, as the record reflects the Veteran has continued to work throughout the period on appeal, despite reporting of the impact of headaches on attendance. Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). 

Currently, the Veteran's headaches are rated as noncompensable from December 1, 2021, until July 6, 2023, and at 30 percent disabling since July 6, 2023.  The Veteran contends that he is entitled to a 30 percent rating since December 1, 2021.  

At the outset, the Board notes that the evidence in this case, specifically the Veteran's reports of his migraine symptoms, present the same disability picture throughout the period on appeal.  In assigning a 30 percent rating since July 6, 2023, the AOJ implicitly found the Veteran's statements regarding his migraine symptoms credible, which is a favorable finding. The Board is bound by this.  38?C.F.R. §?3.104(c).  Accordingly, the remaining question is when the period on appeal began.

Continuous pursuit of a claim or an issue can be achieved by timely and properly filing an appropriate review option, generally within one year of an Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). If a claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500(c). A supplemental claim must be filed within one year after a final decision or the date entitlement arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

The Veteran first filed a claim for service connection of a headache condition on December 1, 2021.  Service connection was granted in a June 2022 rating decision, and a noncompensable rating was assigned.  The Veteran filed an HLR request in January 2023, seeking review of the noncompensable rating.  An April 2023 rating decision continued the Veteran's noncompensable rating, and on July 6, 2023, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim seeking review of the noncompensable rating.  In October 2023, a rating decision granted the Veteran a 30 percent rating, effective in October 2023.  In November 2023, the Veteran filed an HLR request seeking an effective date of December 1, 2021, for the 30 percent rating.  A March 2024 HLR rating decision granted an effective date of July 6, 2023, for the 30 percent rating.  This appeal followed.  

The Board finds that the Veteran has continuously pursued the issue of a compensable rating for his headaches since December 1, 2021, when he filed a claim for service connection for headaches.  Accordingly, the period on appeal began December 1, 2021, and the Veteran is entitled to a 30 percent rating since December 1, 2021.  Since the Veteran first filed a claim for service connection for headaches on December 1, 2021, more than a year after his separation from service, the Veteran is not entitled to an effective date prior to December 1, 2021.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i). 

The Board finds that the Veteran has timely and properly filed for review of his rating for migraine headaches since December 1, 2021.  Therefore, the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of December 1, 2021, and no earlier, for the 30 percent rating for migraine headaches.  This decision is a full grant of the benefits sought on appeal.
