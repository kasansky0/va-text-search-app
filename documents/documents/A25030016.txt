ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as due to toxic exposure risk activities, is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.	In-service participation in a toxic risk exposure activity (TERA) is conceded.

2.	The record evidence does not show that the Veteran's hypertension is related to active service or any incident of service, including as due to his conceded in-service participation in a TERA.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for hypertension, including as due to in-service exposure to toxic exposure risk activity, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1116, 1119, 1120, 1131, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309; PACT Act.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1989 to December 1991.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from March 2024 and May 2024 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

The Veteran selected the Direct Review lane when he submitted a VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, in May 2024. In the direct review lane, the Board reviews the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) rating decision for each issue. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

The Board notes that additional evidence, in the form of a Veteran statement was added to the Veteran's claims file in July 2024. However, because the Veteran selected the direct review lane, this evidence is ineligible for review in the current appeal. Under the direct review lane, the only evidence available for review is the evidence available at the time of the May 2024 rating decision.

1. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, to include as due to toxic exposure risk activities,

The Veteran asserts entitlement to service connection for hypertension. Specifically, the Veteran contends that his hypertension was caused by a TERA during service.

Service connection is warranted where the evidence of record establishes that an injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred in the line of duty in the active service or, if pre-existing service, was aggravated during service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(a), 3.304, 3.310.

To establish service connection for a disability, a veteran must show (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service; and (3) a causal relationship, or nexus, between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service or within an applicable presumptive period, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

It is the policy of VA to administer the law under a broad interpretation, consistent with the facts in each case, with all reasonable doubt to be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. In determining whether service connection is warranted for a disability, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the weight of the evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107.

While the Board must provide reasons and bases supporting a decision, there is no need to discuss, in detail, the evidence submitted by or on behalf of the Veteran. Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence). The analysis below focuses on the most salient and relevant evidence of record. The Veteran should not assume that the Board has overlooked evidence that is not explicitly discussed. Timberlake v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 122 (2000).

The ultimate question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury or disease.

A review of the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) shows multiple blood pressure readings including 98/72, 111/58, 90/65, 120/80, and 110/72. See January 1990, June 1990, August 1990, and November 1990 STRs. There is no evidence of complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of hypertension. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in February 2024. The VA examiner noted a diagnosis of hypertension. The Veteran reported an onset in 2013, found in a routine examination. Following the examination, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's hypertension is less likely than not caused by the toxic exposure risk activities (TERA). In support of this opinion, the VA examiner reasoned that hypertension is not known to be caused by burn pit exposure or exposure to fuels, gases, lubricants, and oils. The VA examiner cited to medical articles and studies to support their conclusion. 

Following a review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for hypertension is not warranted. 

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertions that her hypertension is the result of service. However, the Board finds that the Veteran, as a lay person, without appropriate medical training and expertise in diagnosing and treating hypertension, is not competent to provide a probative opinion as to whether hypertension was caused by active service. Madden v. Gober, 125 F.3d 1477 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The Veteran has not been shown to possess the adequate medical knowledge, education, or training to competently opine to the diagnosis or etiology of a hypertension disability. While the Veteran may state that she experienced hypertension, the Veteran is not competent to provide a diagnosis of a specific disability, or to opine as to the etiology of any disability as those issues fall outside the realm of common knowledge of laypersons. That determination must be provided by a medical professional with the proper training, education, and experience in the appropriate fields. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Board finds the May 2024 VA examiner opinion to be competent, credible, and persuasive. The VA examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's hypertension was related to a TERA. The Board finds the VA examiner's opinion to be more probative than the lay statements of record. The opinion of the VA examiner is highly probative because it is supported by rationale and provided by a trained medical professional. Accordingly, the VA examiner opinion is found to carry significant weight and to be the most persuasive evidence of record. Among the factors for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion are the physician's access to the claims file and the thoroughness and detail of the opinion. It is the responsibility of the Board to assess the credibility and weight to be given to evidence. Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60 (1993); Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190 (1992). The probative value of medical evidence is based on the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data and the medical conclusion reached; as is true of any evidence, the credibility and weight to be attached to medical opinions are within the province of the Board. Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467 (1993).

Additionally, the Veteran's medical records indicate that the Veteran was not treated for hypertension until over two decades after active service, and the Veteran reported at the May 2024 VA examination that the onset of the condition was in 2013. Accordingly, after careful review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the claim and against a finding that hypertension was caused by a TERA as the most persuasive evidence of record does not support that contention.

The Board notes that hypertension is a chronic disability that will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if it were shown as chronic in service; or, if it manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if it were noted in service or within an applicable presumptive period, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013). However, the evidence of record does not indicate that the Veteran's hypertension began during service or during the year after service, and the Veteran reported the disability's onset was 2013. Therefore, the evidence weighs against a finding that the Veteran's hypertension disability is a chronic disability presumed to be related to service.

Service connection is not warranted based on the evidence of record. Though the Veteran has a current hypertension disability, there is no evidence suggesting the existence of an incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury in service or of a causal relationship between an inservice disease or injury and the claimed disability.

The Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the claim of entitlement to service connection for hypertension, and the claim must be denied. The Board finds that the evidence is not in approximate balance, and there is no reasonable doubt to resolve in favor of the Veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is remanded.

The Veteran asserts entitlement to service connection for GERD. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in May 2024. The VA examiner noted a diagnosis of GERD. The Veteran reported an onset in 1991 with heartburn and indigestion. Following the examination, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's GERD is less likely than not caused by TERA. In support of this opinion, the VA examiner reasoned that medical literature does not show a correlation between GERD and TERA, as the cause of GERD is unknown. The VA examiner did not provide a direct service connection opinion. 

The Board finds the May 2024 VA examiner's opinion inadequate, and remand warranted to correct a predecisional duty to assist error. Specifically, the VA examiner did not opine as to direct service connection. The Board notes that the Veteran reports a symptom onset in 1991, during service. See May 2024 VA Examination Report. As such, remand is warranted to obtain an addendum opinion that addresses whether the Veteran's GERD was incurred in or caused by his service.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Forward the Veteran's claim to a qualified medical professional to obtain an addendum opinion as to the nature and etiology of the Veteran's GERD. All pertinent evidence of record must be made available to and reviewed by the clinician. If the clinician determines that an examination is necessary, one should be scheduled. After reviewing the record, the examiner must provide an opinion as to:

2. Whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's GERD is causally related to the Veteran's military service.

If the examiner is unable to offer the requested opinion, it is essential that the examiner offer a rationale for the conclusion that an opinion could not be provided without resort to speculation, together with a statement as to whether there is additional evidence that could enable an opinion to be provided, or whether the inability to provide the opinion is based on the limits of medical knowledge. See Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382 (2010).
