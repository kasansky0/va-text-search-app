DOCKET NO. 210903-182825
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

The appeal is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On February 20, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the appellant, through the authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the appellant (or the appellant's authorized representative) are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Air Force from March 1972 to February 1980.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals from a June 2021 rating decision that denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and diabetes mellitus type 2. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or an authorized representative. Id. 

A written withdrawal must be in writing and include (1) the name of the Veteran or the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the Veteran, (2) the applicable VA file number, and (3) a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety or list the issues withdrawn from the appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1).  In the present case, on February 20, 2025, VA received a statement from the appellant's authorized representative, indicating that the Veteran had opted to withdraw this appeal in this entirety.  This statement meets the requisite criteria for a written withdrawal in 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b).  Because the Veteran has withdrawn the present appeal, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
