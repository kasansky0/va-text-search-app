REMANDED

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for left knee instability is remanded.

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for lateral meniscal tear with left knee strain, status post meniscectomy, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1990 to May 1994.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in December 2023; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the January 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the Veteran's increased ratings claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the Veteran's claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103 (c)(2)(ii).

1. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for left knee instability.

2. Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for lateral meniscal tear with left knee strain, status post meniscectomy.

Under the AMA, if a duty to assist error occurred prior to the RO's decision on appeal, the appeal must be remanded to the RO for correction of the error.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  

When VA undertakes to provide a VA examination or obtain a VA opinion pursuant to the duty to assist, it must ensure that the examination or opinion is adequate.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 312 (2007).

The Board finds the September 2023 VA examination inadequate to make an informed decision, requiring remand.   In reporting range of motion measurements for the Veteran's left knee, the examiner did not address whether motion would be further limited if the Veteran were not taking medication.  In that regard, the examination shows that he treated his knee pain with Tylenol.  

VA may not deny a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when the ameliorative effects of medication are not contemplated by the rating criteria.  Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012); Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327, No. 23-1798 (March 12, 2025) ("VA may not evaluate a disability by relying on factors outside the rating criteria, such as the beneficial effects of medication when medication is not mentioned or contemplated by the rating criteria.")

Accordingly, because the examination is not adequate to make an informed determination on that issue, remand is warranted to correct the AOJ's error in satisfying VA's duty to provide an adequate examination, as the error occurred prior to the decision on appeal.

Further, during the September 2023 VA examination the Veteran reported that he was prescribed a cane for ambulation due to his left knee disability.  The AOJ made a request for any VA treatment records, but none were found at that time.  As such, it appears that the Veteran was treated by a private medical provider for his knee.  These records must be obtained on remand.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain the Veteran's complete treatment records related to his left knee disability from his private medical care provider.

2. Schedule an appropriate VA examination to assess the severity of the Veteran's service-connected left knee disability. The entire claims file and a copy of this REMAND must be made available to the examiner in conjunction with the examination.  

The examiner is asked to provide the following opinion:

If the Veteran were not benefitting from the ameliorative effects of medication, would his range of flexion and/or extension of the left knee be further reduced?  If so, the examiner is asked to provide an estimate, to the extent possible, of what the range of motion would be if his symptoms were not alleviated by medication.

If the examiner is unable to provide such an estimate, the examiner must explain why the available information, including the Veteran's statements, medical history, and the examination findings, is not sufficient for that purpose.
