ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus type II (diabetes) is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's hypertension is not related to service, to include as due to toxic herbicide exposure. 

2. The Veteran's diabetes is not related to service, to include as due to toxic herbicide exposure. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hypertension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1116, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.307, 3.309, 3.313.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for diabetes mellitus type II have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1116, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 3.307, 3.309, 3.313.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1957 to August 1959. 

This matter is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal of a November 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

In the November 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in, or aggravated by, active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1131. Generally, the evidence must show (1) the existence of a present disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service (nexus). Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Evidence of continuous symptoms since active duty is a factor for consideration as to whether a causal relationship exists between an in-service injury or incident and the current disorder as is contemplated under 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Certain chronic diseases, including diabetes and hypertension, may be presumed to have been incurred during service if they become manifested to a compensable degree within one year from separation from active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(3), 3.309(a). This presumption is rebuttable by affirmative evidence to the contrary. Id. 

If a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active service, then certain diseases, including diabetes and hypertension, will be service connected even though there is no record of such disease during service. 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307. For the purposes of this section, the term "herbicide agent" means a chemical in an herbicide used in support of the United States and allied military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era. 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(3); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307(a)(6), 3.309(e), 3.313.

Herbicide exposure may be established on a presumptive basis by demonstrating service in areas where herbicide use was known, such as in the Republic of Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6). Herbicide exposure may also be established as a factual finding based on the evidence. 

1. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension

2. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes 

The Veteran seeks service connection for hypertension and diabetes due to exposure to herbicides, asbestos, and toxic gases while in training and on duty in Korea. 

The Board finds that service connection of hypertension and diabetes is not warranted, to include as based on herbicide exposure. 

As an initial matter, the Board notes that most the Veteran's military records were destroyed in a fire at a National Personnel Records Center facility in July 1973. As a result, there are minimal personnel records and no access to the Veteran's service treatment records. In cases such as this, where the Veteran's service records are unavailable through no fault of the claimant, there is a heightened obligation to carefully consider the benefit-of-the-doubt rule. See O'Hare v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 365 (1991).

Next, the Board notes that the Veteran's treatment records and November 2024 VA examination show diagnoses of hypertension and diabetes. Therefore, the "current disability" element of service connection is met. 

Turning to the medical evidence, the Veteran's private treatment records show that he established with a new provider in August 2021. At that time, he had uncontrolled diabetes and a history of hypertension, but there is no indication when he was first diagnosed with either condition. He presented with oral medications for diabetes, and the bottles were noted to be old. He notably showed cognitive impairments that limited his ability to manage his medication and insulin. Later records indicate a diagnosis of dementia. He began home health services, and his family assisted in his treatment. He had a traumatic fall in February 2024, believed to be due to hypoglycemia. 

The Veteran's VA treatment records similarly show recent treatment for hypertension and diabetes in July 2024. At that time, he had experienced two traumatic falls. His family planned to admit him to a skilled nursing facility at or around that time. 

The Veteran was afforded a November 2024 VA examination, which he attended accompanied by his cousin. The examiner confirmed the diagnoses of diabetes and hypertension, but the onset of these disabilities could not be established. The Veteran was noted to be a poor historian with documented dementia. His cousin was not familiar with the details, but she believed his hypertension began "at a young age." The examiner was unable to complete an accurate diabetes peripheral neuropathy examination due to the Veteran's dementia and responses. The examiner provided negative nexus opinions, noting that there was no documentation to support the claimed toxic exposure, and the Veteran was not a reliable source or historian due to dementia. 

Therefore, the medical evidence does not suggest that the Veteran's disabilities have caused either continuous symptoms since service or that they arose within one year of service. 

Service connection can also be established through a lay statement of continuity of symptoms. However, in this case, the Veteran has not stated that his disabilities began either during service or within one year of separation. The Veteran's cousin indicated hypertension began "at a young age." However, this was not specific enough to imply an onset during or within a year of service that ended when the Veteran was 20 years old.  Accordingly, service connection is not established under either continuous symptoms or the chronic disease presumptions. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a).

Next, the Board has considered whether the disabilities are related to any event, injury, or occurrence during active duty. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). However, the Board finds that there is not sufficient evidence to show such an event, injury, or occurrence. 

In this regard, in his February 2024 claim, the Veteran contended that he developed diabetes and hypertension due to "military stress/Korean environ." In a March 2024 statement, the Veteran reported that he was exposed to herbicide, asbestos, and various gases while serving on active duty in Korea. 

First, the Board notes that the Veteran's service did not create a presumption of herbicide exposure. The Veteran separated from the military in August 1959, which was before any of the periods for which presumptive exposure would be established. See 38 U.S.C. 1116; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307.

Next, there are no contemporaneous service records supporting the Veteran's contentions of exposures. Most of the Veteran's service records were destroyed by fire, and no negative inference is drawn from this lack of evidence. At the same time, it is uncommon for records from the 1950s to include specific support for cases based on toxin exposure. 

The Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements, including that he was exposed to herbicide, asbestos, and various gases in Korea. The Veteran is competent to testify about his personal knowledge and actual observations. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vat. App. 465 (1994). However, competency differs from credibility and probative weight. In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant. See Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 39-40 (1994); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).

Regrettably, in this case, the only indication of toxin exposure is the Veteran's March 2024 statement. This was brief and vague. It included few details that would allow corroboration, only stating that he was exposed while training and staying in barracks in Korea. misstated his years of service, being off by one year regarding both entry and separation. Moreover, the Board cannot ignore the fact that it has been well over 60 years between the time the Veteran first sought service connection and when he left active duty. Finally, through no fault of his own, the Veteran's cognitive decline and diagnosed dementia render his statements less reliable in the absence of any corroboration. For these reasons, the Board finds that the lay evidence has minimal probative weight. 

On the other hand, the Board affords significant probative weight to the VA examiner's opinions, which were provided by a qualified medical professional after review of the claims file, interview with the Veteran and his cousin, examination, and application of the facts to current medical knowledge.

The Board notes that the November 2024 decision on appeal found that the Veteran had participated in toxic exposure risk activity (TERA). However, this finding relied solely on the Veteran's March 2024 statement. As addressed above, this evidence lacked probative weight. Furthermore, it conflicted with the highly probative November 2024 medical examiner's rationale, which was also relied on by the AOJ. Therefore, the Board is not bound by the prior favorable finding because it is rebutted by clear and unmistakable evidence. 

Accordingly, the probative evidence of record does not support a finding that the Veteran was exposed to herbicide agents, asbestos, or other toxins during service. See 38 CFR 20.801.

Because the evidence weighs against the claims, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).  The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
