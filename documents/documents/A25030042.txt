ORDER

Entitlement to basic eligibility for substitution is established, and the claim to substitute is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Within one year of the Veteran's death, the appellant-who is the surviving spouse of the Veteran-filed a request for substitution and a claim for entitlement to recognition of A.T., U.T., and H.T. as the Veteran's dependent children was pending at the time of the Veteran's death.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to basic eligibility for substitution based upon death of a claimant have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5121, 5121A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1000, 3.1010.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably from July 1965 to June 1967. He died in May 2023 and the appellant is his surviving spouse.

In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to basic eligibility for substitution is established, and the claim to substitute is granted.

The appellant is seeking to substitute for the Veteran for purposes of processing any claims pending at the time of the Veteran's death to their completion.

Legal criteria

The statute governing substitution of parties is set forth at 38 U.S.C. § 5121A. This first subpart of that statute provides:

If a claimant dies while a claim for any benefit under a law administered by the Secretary, or an appeal of a decision with respect to such a claim, is pending, a living person who would be eligible to receive accrued benefits due to the claimant under section 5121(a) of this title may, not later than one year after the date of the death of such claimant, file a request to be substituted as the claimant for the purposes of processing the claim to completion.

The implementing regulation further emphasizes that a claim or appeal must be pending. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010 (g)(1). A claim is considered to be pending if the claimant had filed the claim with an agency of original jurisdiction or Board but dies before the agency of original jurisdiction or Board makes a decision on the case. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010 (g)(1)(i).

Analysis

Turning to the evidence of record, the Board notes in August 2023, the appellant submitted a VA Form 21-534 application for dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC), death pension and accrued benefits by a surviving spouse.

VA regulations clearly state that a claim for DIC benefits is deemed to include a request to substitute. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010 (c)(2). As such, there is no dispute that the appellant timely filed her claim for substitution. The evidence of record also clearly establishes the appellant as the surviving spouse of the Veteran.

The disposition of this case therefore turns on whether the evidence establishes that there was a pending, unadjudicated claim filed by the Veteran prior to his death. The Board finds following a review of the record that there was a pending appeal to the Board related to a dependency claim filed by the Veteran prior to his death. Specifically, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement appealing a December 2022 AOJ decision in February 2023. This appeal is currently pending with the Board.

Consequently, because the Veteran's dependency claim remains pending with the Board, the appellant is recognized as the substitute claimant to continue the Veteran's claim to completion.
