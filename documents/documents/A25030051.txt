ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy, sciatic nerve, as secondary to the service-connected thoracic strain with thoracolumbar degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease (claimed as left leg condition), is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for a neck disability is denied.

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for tension headaches, to include as secondary to service-connected thoracic strain with thoracolumbar degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease, is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's left lower extremity radiculopathy, sciatic nerve, is due to the service-connected thoracic strain with thoracolumbar degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease.

2. The evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's neck disability is etiologically related to any in service injury, disease, or event.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy, sciatic nerve, as secondary to the service-connected as secondary to the service-connected thoracic strain with thoracolumbar degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease (claimed as left leg condition) have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5104(b)(4), 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.103(f)(4), 3.104(c), 3.303, 20.801(a).

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a neck disability have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1994 to April 2001.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a June 2022 rating decision from a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

By way of background, a December 2015 rating decision issued under the legacy review system denied service connection for headaches, neck condition, and left leg condition. The Veteran did not appeal this rating decision or submit new and material evidence within one year of notification of this rating decision. In February 2021, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim for headaches, neck pain, and left leg pain, among other conditions. In a May 2021 rating decision, the AOJ favorably found that new and relevant evidence had been received sufficient for reconsideration of the previously denied claims but continued the denial for service connection for headaches, neck condition, and left leg condition. In February 2022, the Veteran filed a VA 20-0996, Request for HLR. The AOJ identified a duty to assist error and returned the claims for further development. See March 2022 Rating Decision. However, after further development, the AOJ continued the denial of service connection for headaches, neck, and left leg radiculopathy. See June 2022 Rating Decision. 

In the August 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to service connection for tension headaches, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of that claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. To substantiate a claim of service connection, there must be evidence of: (1) a current disability (for which service connection is sought); (2) incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the disease or injury in service and the present disability. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be established on a secondary basis for a disability that is proximately due to, the result of, or aggravated by a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), (b). Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires competent and credible evidence demonstrating (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) a service-connected disability; and (3) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a), (b); see also Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter (which includes but is not limited to equipoise), VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 778 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy, sciatic nerve, as secondary to the service-connected thoracic strain with thoracolumbar degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease, is granted.  

The Veteran seeks service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy as secondary to his low back disability. See February 2022 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review (HLR). For the reasons stated below, the Board finds that service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy is warranted.

Subsequent to the June 2022 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ granted service connection for the "lumbosacral radiculopathy, sciatic nerve, left lower extremity as secondary to the service-connected degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine with degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) and thoracic strain," in a February 2024 rating decision. In doing so, the AOJ rendered favorable findings such as the Veteran having a current left lower extremity radiculopathy disability, a service-connected disability of degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine with degenerative disc disease other than intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) and thoracic strain, and a nexus between the current diagnosis and the service-connected disability. See February 2024 Rating Decision.

In this situation, caselaw has clarified that an appeal is moot only if the granting of the claim would not lead to any effectual relief whatsoever to the appellant, such as preserving the possibility of an earlier effective date or ancillary benefits. See Green v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 127, 136-48 (2024); Bailey v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 188, 204 (2021); see also Warren v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 214, 221 (2016) (holding that a subsequent AOJ decision cannot divest the Board of jurisdiction over the prior appeal; therefore, an AOJ grant of service connection cannot finally decide the claim of service connection already on appeal to the Board).

As a general matter, under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), if a later AOJ decision grants any benefits that are on appeal by a VA Form 10182 (NOD) before the Board, such as the case here, the Board should accept the favorable AOJ rating decision as binding. This is the case even though the Board cannot consider the untimely evidence the AOJ considered in rendering its favorable decision. The Board notes that the favorable findings in the February 2024 AOJ decision are not evidence and are binding on the Board. Thus, the Board may rely on these favorable findings to grant the service connection claim for left leg radiculopathy currently on appeal. Accordingly, the favorable findings demonstrate current diagnosis, a service-connected disability, and a nexus between the current diagnosis and the service-connected disability. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b)(4); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.103(f)(4), 3.104(c), 20.801(a).

Here, potential additional benefits may stem from the earlier claim pending on appeal before the Board. Accordingly, the claim of entitlement to service connection for left lower extremity radiculopathy, sciatic nerve, as secondary to the service-connected thoracic strain with thoracolumbar degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease, is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

Entitlement to service connection for a neck disability is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for a neck disability, diagnosed as spondylosis at C6-C7, which he contends is attributable to his period in service. See February 2022 Request for HLR; see also December 2015 C&P Exam. The Board concludes that, while the Veteran has a current diagnosis of cervical spondylosis, the evidence weighs against finding that the Veteran's disability is etiologically related to service. 

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the AOJ made favorable findings that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a neck disability and the Veteran has a qualifying event, injury, or disease during service, noting neck pain documented in the Veteran's service treatment record (STR) and a motor vehicle accident while on active duty. See June 2022 Rating Decision. The Board is bound by these favorable findings. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a). Thus, the first and second elements of direct service connection are satisfied, leaving the nexus element as the remaining issue to be addressed. 

Turning to the third element, the Board finds that there is no persuasive evidence of record linking the Veteran's current neck disability to his active duty service. The Veteran underwent a VA examination in December 2015. The examination report documents a diagnosis of spondylosis at C6-C7, noting functional and mechanical discomfort, as well as popping sensation with rotation, but no history of injury or surgery. The examiner opined that that the Veteran's neck disability is less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. The examiner explained that the Veteran has a very mild degeneration of his cervical spine that is age appropriate and would not have been present in 2001. See December 2015 C&P Exam. 

In April 2022, a review of the Veteran's record was conducted, and a VA examiner provided a medical opinion concluding that the Veteran's claimed neck disability was less likely than not (less than 50 percent probability) incurred in or caused by the reported in-service injury, event or illness. The examiner explained that the neck condition during service was acute. Additionally, there is no evidence of ongoing treatment or chronic care, with a significant gap in medical care from 2001 to 2022. As a result, a nexus between the current disability and military service has not been established. See April 2022 C&P Exam. 

In June 2022, another review of the Veteran's record was conducted, and the VA examiner similarly opined that the Veteran's claimed neck disability was less likely than not (less than 50 percent probability) incurred in or caused by the reported in-service injury, event or illness. The examiner noted that there is no objective evidence of a chronic neck condition during service or within one year of separation. While the Veteran reported neck pain following a motor vehicle accident in August 1999, the symptoms resolved. Post-service, the Veteran first reported neck pain in 2012, without any documented injury or details. The diagnosis of cervical spine spondylosis was based on a 2015 X-ray, representing a 13-year gap between separation and diagnosis. Additionally, there is no evidence of chronicity of care to support a service connection. See June 2022 C&P Exam. 

In support of his claim, the Veteran submitted private medical treatment records, including a statement from T.M.D., PA-C, who generally opined that the Veteran's "current diagnoses is [sic] more likely than not a direct result of a service-connected condition." Additionally, the private medical records document neck pain and muscle spasms in 2020-2021. Id. The statement references a cervical spine X-ray from August 23, 1999, but does not provide further explanation or a detailed rationale regarding the Veteran's neck disability. See March 2021 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds it challenging to rely on the private clinician's opinion because it lacks a clear rationale and supporting medical explanation. While the private clinician, T.M.D., PA-C, states that the Veteran's disability is "more likely than not" a direct result of a service-connected condition, the opinion does not explain why this conclusion was reached. Additionally, while the statement references a cervical spine X-ray from August 1999, it fails to analyze the findings or establish a medical link between the in-service event and the current diagnosis. The March 2018 private medical opinion is conclusory and does not provide the necessary evidentiary weight for adjudication.

Moreover, all three VA medical opinions-December 2015, April 2022, and June 2022-concluded that there is no nexus between the Veteran's current neck disability and his military service. Although the Board assigns the April 2022 VA opinion no probative value as it contained an inaccurate factual premise (e.g., "gap in care from 2001-2022"), see Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (holding that a medical opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value), the Board finds the December 2015 and June 2022 VA opinions to be probative in this case, as they are based upon review of the pertinent evidence and provides supporting rationale for their conclusions. The December 2015 VA examiner explained that the Veteran has a very mild degeneration of his cervical spine that is age appropriate and would not have been present in 2001. The most recent VA opinion from June 2022 specifically emphasizes that there is no chronicity of care, noting that the Veteran's in-service August 1999 motor vehicle accident resulted in acute neck pain that subsequently resolved with no evidence of ongoing treatment or complaints after service. 

Notably, despite the availability of medical care, there was no documented complaint or treatment for a chronic neck condition in the years following service. This conclusion is further supported by relevant VA treatment records, which show that the Veteran sought treatment for other conditions since 2008 but did not report neck pain until July 2014, many years after his service. See March 2022 CAPRI Record. Moreover, the Veteran has not contended that he had neck symptomatology since service.  The significant gap in care and lack of continuity of symptoms reinforce the examiner's determination that the Veteran's current neck disability is less likely than not related to service. See Maxson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 453, 459 (1999), aff'd sub nom. Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Fountain v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 258, 272 (2015) ("[T]he Board must first establish a proper foundation for drawing inferences against a claimant from an absence of documentation."); Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 239 n.7 (2012) (recognizing that the absence of evidence cannot be substantive negative evidence without "a proper foundation...to demonstrate that such silence has a tendency to prove or disprove a relevant fact"); Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 221, 224 (2011) (citing Fed. R. Evid. 803 (7) for the proposition that "the absence of an entry in a record may be evidence against the existence of a fact if it would ordinarily be recorded"). 

In this case, there is no probative evidence linking the Veteran's current neck disability to his active duty service. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's lay statements regarding etiology but assigns them less probative weight than the objective evidence of record. The issue as to the etiology of the Veteran's neck disability is medically complex, as it requires specialized medical knowledge and training, which the Veteran has not been shown to possess. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007); see also Kahana v. Shinseki, 24. Vet. App. 428 (2011). Consequently, the Board gives more probative weight to the VA examiner's opinion.  

In the absence of competent and credible evidence linking the Veteran's current neck disability to any incident of service, entitlement to service connection for a neck disability, diagnosed as spondylosis at C6-C7, on a direct basis is not warranted. In sum, the most probative evidence establishes that the Veteran's neck disability is not etiologically related to his period of service. Accordingly, the service connection claim for a neck disability is denied. As the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), is therefore not for application as to this claim. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application); 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to service connection for tension headaches, to include as secondary to service-connected thoracic strain with thoracolumbar degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease, is remanded.

The Veteran seeks service connection for headaches. See August 2022 VA Form 10182 NOD. The Veteran's representative argued that the Veteran's service treatment records are positive for treatment for headaches. See August 2022 Third Party Correspondence. 

As an initial matter, in March 2022, the AOJ found a duty to assist error and returned the Veteran's claim for headaches to develop for a direct service connection and secondary service connection medical opinions. See March 2022 VA Form 20-0996 HLR Return. It was specifically requested to provide a secondary service connection opinion for headaches due to the back and/or neck condition. Id. However, the Board notes that the Veteran does not have a service-connected neck disability, as that claim has been denied herein. Thus, service connection for headaches cannot be granted secondary to a neck disability. 

Upon review of the record, the Board finds that a remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty-to-assist error. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). Specifically, remand is necessary in this case to obtain an adequate medical opinion. See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (holding that when VA provides an examination to a claimant, VA must ensure the examination is adequate).

Here, the relevant evidence of record shows that there are three VA medical opinions for headaches. In December 2015, the VA examiner concluded that she cannot associate the Veteran's current headaches to the one-time evaluation of tension headaches (March 30, 1998) in service without resorting to speculation. The examiner noted that there is no evidence of ongoing headaches in service. See December 2015 C&P Exam. While the examiner acknowledged the Veteran's medical history, the VA opinion is inadequate because the examiner did not provide a clear explanation why a nexus opinion cannot be provided without resorting to mere speculation, particularly given that the STRs also document headache complaints on December 19, 1996, in addition to the March 30, 1998, one-time evaluation she referred to. Additionally, the rationale does not provide for a secondary service connection opinion relevant to the issue on appeal. 

In April 2022, the VA examiner provided an addendum opinion stating that the Veteran's tension headaches are less likely than not (less than 50 percent probability) incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event, or illness. The examiner noted that the Veteran's headaches were acute, and that no chronicity of care was established. The examiner also noted that there was a gap in care from 2001-2022; thus, a nexus has not been established. See April 2022 C&P Exam. Here, the Board finds the opinion inadequate because it is based on an incorrect factual premise. See Reonal, 5 Vet. App. at 461 (holding that a medical opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise has no probative value). The examiner noted that there is a gap in care from 2001-2022 but VA treatment records document reports of headaches as early as October 2008. See November 2015 CAPRI Record. 

In June 2022, a VA examiner opined that the Veteran's tension headaches are less likely than not (less than 50 percent probability) proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service-connected degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine with degenerative disc disease (DDD). The examiner explained that tension headaches and degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine with DDD are not medically related, and that medical literature does not support a causal relationship. Specifically, she mentioned that there is no medical literature that establishes a causal or potential for aggravation by an orthopedic condition to the neurological condition of headaches. It also cited to medical literature from UpToDate.com on the uncertain and multifactorial nature of tension-type headaches. See June 2022 C&P Exam. However, the Board finds this opinion inadequate because the opinion lacks discussion of the Veteran's unique medical history and the medical literature cited does not fully rule out an indirect relationship. The examiner actually points out that tension-type headaches is multifactorial, and its mechanism is uncertain, yet if it is dynamic and individualized, the Veteran's specific condition could still contribute to headache exacerbation. Moreover, the examiner gave no rationale for secondary aggravation. Therefore, the June 2022 VA examiner's opinion is inadequate to resolve the Veteran's claim for secondary service connection. See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 138-40 (2013) (holding that a medical opinion regarding secondary service connection must address both causation and aggravation to be adequate). 

Based on the foregoing, a remand is necessary to obtain an addendum opinion to determine the etiology of the Veteran's claimed headaches disability. The failure to obtain an adequate VA opinion prior to the June 2022 rating decision constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error warranting a remand. 38?C.F.R. §?20.802(a).

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum opinion regarding the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed headaches. The examiner should review the claims file and provide a complete rationale for all opinion(s) expressed. If a new examination is deemed necessary, one shall be provided. 

The examiner is specifically requested to address the following:

(a)	Please provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's headaches had its onset during the Veteran's active service, or is otherwise related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

(b)	Please provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's headaches were caused or aggravated by his service-connected thoracic strain with thoracolumbar degenerative arthritis and degenerative disc disease. Please provide separate rationales for both secondary causation and aggravation.

In addressing the above, the examiner must consider and discuss all pertinent in- and post-service evidence, including the Veteran's lay statements and assertions of his symptoms during his medical visits. The examiner is directed to consider the December 19, 1996, and March 30, 1998, note in the Veteran's STRs that he had complaints of headaches. See May 2001 STR-Medical.

The examiner must provide a comprehensive report including a clearly stated rationale for any opinions offered and conclusions reached, citing the objective medical findings leading to the conclusions, and must not be based solely on the lack of records. In this regard, the Board emphasizes that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms and history, and such statements by the Veteran regarding symptomatology and medical history must be specifically acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinions concerning the onset and severity of his disability. If such reports are rejected by the examiner, a reason for doing so must be provided. 

                                  (CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)

A complete rationale should be provided for all opinions expressed.
