ORDER

1. Entitlement to service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

2. The Veteran's tinnitus did not manifest in service or within one year of separation from active duty and is not otherwise related to service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309(a).

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for tinnitus have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131, 1137, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2012 to November 2012 and from January 2021 to February 2021.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an April 2024 rating decision issued by the AOJ, wherein the AOJ denied service connection for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  The AOJ additionally made favorable findings that are discussed further herein by which the Board is bound.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

In August 2024, the Veteran timely appealed the decision to the Board by submitting a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD) and requesting a "Direct Review" of the evidence by a Veterans Law Judge.  In an Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) Direct Review appeal where the rating decision on appeal is a higher-level review, the Board considers the evidence of record at the time of the April 2024 rating decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision here.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Veteran would like the VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  See 38 U.S.C. §1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  The three-element test to establish service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Disorders diagnosed after discharge will still be service connected if all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Additionally, where a veteran served 90 days or more of active service, and certain chronic diseases, such as sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus, which are organic diseases of the nervous system, become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within one year after the date of separation from such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309(a).

Special rules apply to National Guard and Reserve service.  The first step in any claim for veterans' benefits is whether the claimant is considered a "veteran" as defined under VA law.  Service in the National Guard, even during period of active duty for training or inactive duty training, without more, will not suffice to give one "veteran" status.  Donnellan v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 167, 172 (2010).  Active duty for training is, among other things, full-time duty in the Armed Forces performed by Reserves for training purposes or by members of the National Guard of any state.  38 U.S.C. § 101(22); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(c).  Thus, to establish "veteran" status with respect to service in the National Guard, and eligibility for service connection, the record must show that a claimant was disabled due to a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during a period of active duty for training.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 101, 1131; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1, 3.6; see also Biggins v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 474, 478 (1991).  Alternatively, service connection can be granted for an injury (but not a disease) incurred during inactive duty training.  See Mercado-Martinez v. West, 11 Vet. App. 415, 419 (1998); Paulson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 466, 470 (1995); Biggins v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 474, 478 (1991); see also 38 U.S.C. § 101(24); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(a).  A claimant whose claim is based on a period of active duty for training can never be entitled to the presumptions of service connection for chronic diseases.  Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40, 47 (2010).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability.   

The Veteran contends that service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability is warranted as related to in-service acoustic trauma.  Specifically, in a September 2023 lay statement, the Veteran states that in 2018 while on active-duty orders, his auditory protective gear fell out while qualifying for his M4 weapon on the rifle range.  Later that day, a cease fire was called, so he was not wearing his protective gear.  While standing a few feet away from a soldier cleaning a 50 caliber weapon, the weapon had a negligent discharge.  Following this incident, the Veteran contends that he could not hear as well in his left ear and was seen twice in relation to this incident.  He notes that after returning to regular National Guard status, he attended two yearly physicals that showed that the hearing in his left ear had decreased.  He states that pressure and altitude changes along with high-pitched noises cause him great discomfort and dizziness accompanied by headaches.        

Under VA regulations, hearing impairment constitutes a disability for VA purposes when auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz (Hz) is 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.

The Board has carefully reviewed the evidence of record and finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence is against the claim for service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability.  The reasons follow.

In the April 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ conceded in-service noise exposure based upon the Veteran's military occupational specialty of Combat Engineer, which has a high probability of noise exposure.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

Notwithstanding the fact that the Veteran experienced acoustic trauma during service, the cornerstone of any service-connection claim is a current disability.  In this instance, the Veteran does not have a current hearing loss disability for VA purposes.  

In a February 2024 VA audiological examination, pure thresholds, in decibels, were as follows: 

	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	20	25	20	15	15

LEFT	20	30	30	25	20

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 96 percent in both ears.

Here, the Veteran's February 2024 VA audiogram shows he did not have an auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz at 40 decibels or greater, or a measurement of auditory thresholds for at least three of these frequencies that was 26 decibels or greater.  38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  Additionally, his speech discrimination was at 96 percent in each ear, and it needs to be less than 94 percent to meet a hearing loss disability.  Id.  Accordingly, the evidence does not support that the Veteran has a bilateral hearing loss disability for VA purposes.  This same finding was documented in the July 2024 rating decision on appeal.

There is caselaw that says that the threshold for normal hearing is from zero to 20 decibels, with higher threshold levels indicating some degree of hearing loss. Hensley v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 155, 157 (1993).  Indeed, the Veteran's February 2024 audiogram revealed pure tone thresholds in the frequencies of 1000, 2000, and 3000 that are greater than 20 Hertz, which is indicative that the Veteran has some degree of hearing loss, bilaterally.  However, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 are clear in outlining the requirements of the degree of hearing loss required to be considered a disability for VA purposes.  Again, these requirements are auditory threshold in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz at 40 decibels or greater, or a measurement of auditory thresholds for at least three of these frequencies that was 26 decibels or greater.  Thus, while it may be true that the Veteran has some degree of hearing loss to a level that could be diagnosed by the February 2024 examiner, the audiometry findings of record did not show a severity for which the Veteran is able to be found to have a bilateral hearing loss disability under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  Consequently, the Veteran is found to not have a current bilateral hearing loss disability for VA purposes as a matter of law.  

Service connection is predicated on the existence of a current disability for VA purposes.  At present, there is no competent evidence of record that establishes the existence of a bilateral hearing loss disability under the clear requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans (Court) has specifically upheld the validity of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 to define hearing loss for VA compensation purposes.  Laypersons are sometimes competent to provide opinions regarding etiology and diagnosis.  In this case, the Board finds that the specific audiological results shown on examination are more probative evidence than the Veteran's own contentions as to whether he manifests a bilateral hearing loss disability for VA purposes.

The Board notes that within the February 2024 VA examination report, the audiologist concluded that the Veteran had sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear (but found normal hearing in the right ear), which, as noted above, is a "chronic disease" where service connection may be warranted if it manifests to a compensable degree within one year following discharge from service. However, there is no competent evidence that the Veteran incurred a left ear hearing loss "disability" to a compensable degree within one year of separation from service. The fact that a veteran has an organic disease of the nervous system during or after service is not determinative unless that disease results in "disability." For hearing loss purposes, VA has defined a hearing loss "disability' as a condition that meets the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. Because the Veteran's left ear hearing loss does not meet those criteria, he cannot be awarded service connection for a left ear hearing loss "disability."

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131.  Evidence must show that the Veteran currently has the disability for which benefits are being claimed.  Because the evidence shows that the Veteran does not have a bilateral hearing loss disability for VA purposes during the pendency of the appeal, the Board finds that service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability is not warranted.

For the above reasons, the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to whether service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability is warranted.  Rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).  Thus, the claim for service connection for a bilateral hearing loss disability is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus. 

The Veteran contends that service connection for tinnitus is warranted as related to in-service acoustic trauma.  In a September 2023 lay statement, the Veteran indicates that in 2018 while on active-duty orders, his auditory protective gear fell out while qualifying for his M4 weapon on the rifle range.  Later that day, there was another incident in which he was not wearing his protective gear because a cease fire was called.  While standing a few feet away from a soldier cleaning a 50 caliber weapon, the weapon had a negligent discharge.  He contends that since then, he cannot hear as well in his left ear.  The Veteran states that he was seen twice in relation to this incident.  The Veteran notes that after returning to regular National Guard status, he attended two yearly physicals that showed that the hearing in his left ear had decreased.  He continues to experience ringing in both ears.  He also stated that pressure and altitude changes along with high-pitched noises cause him great discomfort and dizziness accompanied by headaches.        

The Board has carefully reviewed the evidence of record and finds that the persuasive weight of the evidence is against the grant of service connection for tinnitus.  The reasons follow.

In the April 2024 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ conceded in-service noise exposure based upon the Veteran's military occupational specialty of Combat Engineer, which has a high probability of noise exposure.  The Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

While neither the AOJ nor the February 2024 VA examiner found that the Veteran had a current disability, the Board notes that a lay person is competent to diagnose tinnitus.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Here, the Veteran's report that he experiences ringing in his ears is sufficient to satisfy the current disability element.  With the elements of current disability and in-service disease or injury met, the threshold question is whether the Veteran's tinnitus is related to service. 

In this instance, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs against a nexus between the Veteran's tinnitus and his service.  Here, during a February 2024 VA examination, the Veteran reported experiencing intermittent tinnitus occurring on average twice per day for 10 seconds.  Based on this, the examiner found that the Veteran experienced tinnitus but that it was not recurrent.  The examiner referenced medical research showing that patients often confuse transient ear noise with chronic tinnitus.  The examiner stated that medical research differentiated the two as chronic tinnitus consisting of noise that must last at least five minutes and occur at least two times per week.  The examiner then stated that tinnitus could occur from different sources, but in most cases, tinnitus was accompanied by measurable hearing loss.  The examiner noted that on examination, the Veteran had normal hearing sensitivity and clinically normal hearing for VA standards.  The examiner indicated that in the Veteran's case, there was not a significant in-service threshold shift present.  In the absence of an objectively verifiable noise injury, the examiner stated that an association between the claimed tinnitus and noise exposure could not be assumed to exist.  The examiner acknowledged that the audiogram was an imperfect measurement.  Nevertheless, the examiner explained that audiograms were accepted as the objective basis for determining noise injuries.  As such, the examiner opined that it was less likely than not that the Veteran's tinnitus was caused by or a result of military noise exposure.

The Board finds the VA medical opinion adequate and probative because the examiner reviewed the claims file, performed an in-person examination, and supported conclusions with well-reasoned rationale.  Here, an August 2012 audiogram documents that for the Veteran's right ear, pure thresholds for frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz were 15, 10, 5, 15, and 5.  The left ear pure thresholds for frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz were 20, 15, 15, 10, and 0.  During the February 2024 VA examination, the Veteran's right ear pure thresholds for frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz were 20, 25, 20, 15, and 15.  Left ear pure threshold values were 20, 30, 30, 25, and 20.  This is consistent with the examiner's finding that the Veteran's hearing was normal during active duty and that 12 years later, the Veteran's hearing continues to be normal, demonstrating an absence of objectively verifiable noise injury.

The Board notes that although the Veteran is competent to report symptoms that establish a diagnosis of tinnitus, he is not competent to directly link his tinnitus to service, as medical expertise is required.  In this regard, the question of causation involves a medical subject concerning an internal physical process extending beyond an immediately observable cause-and-effect relationship.  As such, the question of etiology in this case may not be competently addressed by lay evidence, and the Veteran's lay statements are nonprobative evidence.

The Board additionally finds that service connection for tinnitus is not warranted on a presumptive basis.  In a September 2023 lay statement, the Veteran contends that he has experienced ringing in his ears since a 2018 incident on the rifle range.  Thereafter, during the 2024 VA examination, the Veteran reports the onset of his tinnitus as three to four years prior, which would be approximately 2020 to 2021.  Despite these conflicting statements regarding the onset of the Veteran's tinnitus, which raises credibility concerns, an onset of tinnitus in 2018 or in 2020 would not qualify for presumptive service connection.  In this instance, the Veteran's two periods of active duty are from August 2012 to November 2012 and from January 2021 to February 2021.  The first period lasted for more than 90 days, and the Veteran is not alleging that tinnitus began during that period or within one year of that period of active duty.  

A veteran is not entitled to consideration of presumptive service connection for a chronic disease for a period of active duty for training that is less than 90 days.  Thus, even if the Board conceded that tinnitus manifested in 2021 or 2022, that period of active duty does not qualify for presumptive service connection.  Thus, service connection for tinnitus is not warranted on a presumptive basis for a chronic disease. 

For all the reasons laid out above, the Board finds the persuasive weight of the evidence is against the claim for service connection for tinnitus.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine is therefore not for application.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.  Therefore, service connection for tinnitus is denied.
