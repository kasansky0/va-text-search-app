ORDER

An increased rating of 70 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted effective May 9, 2023.

An increased rating of 20 percent for limitation of right knee flexion is granted effective January 8, 2024.

A separate rating of 10 percent for symptomatic removal of right knee semilunar cartilage is granted effective January 8, 2024.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Beginning May 9, 2023, the Veteran's PTSD was productive of deficiencies in the areas of family relations, judgment, thinking, school, and mood. See May 2023 VA Treatment Record and January 2024 VA Medical Opinion.

2. Beginning January 8, 2024, the record demonstrates that without the use of Ibuprofen, the Veteran's right knee flexion would be limited to 30 degrees after repeated use over time and during flare-ups. See January 2024 VA Examination Report.

3. Beginning January 8, 2024, the record demonstrates that Veteran experienced swelling and pain after the September 2020 meniscectomy. Id. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an increased rating of 70 percent, but no higher, for PTSD are met, effective May 9, 2023. 38?U.S.C. §§?1155, 5107; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.102, 3.400(o), 4.1, 4.3, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411.

2. The criteria for an increased rating of 20 percent, but no higher, for limitation of flexion of the right knee are met, effective January 8, 2024. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400(o), 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.40, 4.45, 4.59, 4.68, 4.71a, DC 5260.

3. The criteria for a separate rating of 10 percent for symptomatic removal of semilunar cartilage of the right knee are met, effective January 8, 2024. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.10, 4.40, 4.45, 4.68, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5258 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2010 to November 2024. This matter comes before the Board of Veteran's Appeal (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In January 2024, the Veteran submitted his claim for increased ratings for PTSD and the right knee disability. Subsequently, in February 2024, the RO issued a rating decision that continued the 50 percent rating for PTSD and 10 percent rating for the right knee condition. In response, the Veteran submitted a February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal and selected the Direct Review docket at the Board.

Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of February 6, 2024-the date of the rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after February 6, 2024, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

As a final note, in February 2024, the Veteran was informed that he had a year from the date his rating decision was mailed to him or within 60 days of the date the Board received his NOD to switch his Board review option. The Veteran did not respond to the Board's February 2024 letter. As more than year passed since the February 2024 rating decision was issued and the 60-day period specified in the February 2024 letter has lapsed, the Board finds that the period to switch his Board review option has expired. Accordingly, the Board will proceed with the adjudication of his appeal.

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the rating criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) and represent the average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life including employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10.

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA compensation as well as the whole recorded history of the Veteran's disability. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; see generally Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for that rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Otherwise, the lower rating is assigned. Id. Additionally, while it is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

PTSD

As noted in the Conclusions of Law section, the Board finds that an increased rating of 70 percent for PTSD is warranted, but no higher. Accordingly, to this extent, the Veteran's claim is granted.

Turning to the evidence of record, the relevant clinical evidence includes a January 2024 VA medical opinion. The January 2024 VA examiner concluded that PTSD caused occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks, although generally functioning satisfactorily with normal routine behavior, self-care, and conversation. Notably, this determination is not binding on the Board. 

As stated in the Findings of Fact section, the Board, however, finds that PTSD resulted in an occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas. In first addressing impairment in family relations, the Veteran reported that he was unable to sustain a healthy intimate relationship. See January 2024 VA Medical Opinion. The examiner noted that aside from the Veteran's animals, he lived alone. Accordingly, this examiner opined that he had difficulty establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships and an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. Id. Based on the medical evidence, the Board finds that an impairment in family and social relations has been established. 

Additionally, the January 2024 VA medical opinion demonstrates that the Veteran experienced impairments in the areas of thinking, mood, and judgment. In this regard, the examiner noted that the Veteran continued to experience numerous acquired psychiatric symptoms, including depression and anxiety. See January 2024 VA Medical Opinion. He also demonstrated impaired judgment, as he recently was arrested. Id. Further, the examiner noted he reported that he suffered from irritable behavior, angry outbursts, reckless or self-destructive behavior, and hypervigilance. Id. and May 2023 VA Treatment Record. The examiner also noted that he experienced persistent, distorted cognitions and markedly diminished interest in significant activities. Id. Moreover, the examiner noted these PTSD symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social or other important areas of functioning. Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that record demonstrates that the Veteran experienced impairment in the areas of thinking, mood, and judgment throughout the appeal period. 

Turning next to impairment in the area of work, the Board finds an impairment in this area. Although the Veteran maintained his job with Los Angeles County, the examiner noted that experienced difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. The examiner also opined that PTSD symptoms caused clinically significant distress or impairment in his occupational functioning. The Board finds that this evidence supports the conclusion that PTSD causes a work impairment. The Board also finds that if the Veteran was enrolled in school, he would also experience an impairment in that area as well due to his PTSD symptoms.  

Although the Board finds that an increased 70 percent rating is warranted, it also finds that the next higher rating of 100 percent is not warranted for this period on appeal. In support of this determination, the Board finds that the PTSD was not productive of total?social?impairment as contemplated by the criteria for a 100 percent rating. In this regard, the January 2024 VA examiner noted that there was no evidence of any delusional thinking or odd speech. The examiner also noted that he denied past and current suicidal or homicidal thoughts. Although the VA examiner noted that he engages in self-destructive or reckless behavior, the Board finds that he is not in persistent danger of hurting himself or others. The Board acknowledges that he has a charge for driving while under the influence, but the record does not demonstrate that he regularly engages in this reckless behavior or self-destructive behavior. Further, he reported that has not suffered from suicidal or homicidal thoughts. It also appears that he sustained his employment this period on appeal, although he experienced a work impairment work. Although the Veteran experienced impairment in?most areas as?contemplated by the regulation, the Board cannot find that his condition was productive of total social or occupational impairment, in line with an even higher?100?percent rating.? Further, the record does not reflect, nor has the Veteran reported, gross impairment in thought processes or communication, persistent delusions or hallucinations, grossly inappropriate behavior, extreme memory loss, or an intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living.? As such, a higher 100 percent rating for PTSD is not warranted. 

In sum, the Board finds that the Veteran is entitled to a 70 percent rating for PTSD, but no higher. ?See?38?C.F.R. §?4.7. 

In assigning May 9, 2023 as the effective date for the 70 percent rating for PTSD, the Board notes that 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o) addresses the assignment of effective dates in claims for increased ratings. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1), the effective date of any award is either the date VA received the claim at issue, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. Further, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2), VA may assign a retroactive effective date up to one year prior to the date of receipt of claim if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred within the year prior to the claim's filing. Here, the evidence of record demonstrates that May 9, 2023 is the first date that is was factually ascertainable that the Veteran's PTSD increased in severity as a VA treating clinician noted that he needed help with anger management. See May 2023 VA Treatment Record. Thus, the Board finds that May 9, 2023 is the applicable effective date for the 70 percent rating for PTSD. 

Right Knee Disability

As indicated in the Conclusions of Law section, the Board finds that an increased rating of 20 percent for limited flexion of the right knee is warranted effective January 8, 2024. The Board also finds that a separate rating of 10 percent for symptomatic semilunar cartilage in the right knee is warranted effective January 8, 2024. Accordingly, to this extent, the Veteran's claim is granted.

As an overview of the organization of this analysis, the Board will first explain the applicable rating criteria for the Veteran's right knee condition. The Board will then address why the Veteran is entitled to 20 percent evaluation for limited flexion of the right knee. Next, the Board will explain why the Veteran is entitled to a separate rating under DC 5259, but no additional diagnostic codes for the right knee condition. 

Here, the Veteran's right knee strain status post meniscal tear is currently rated as 10 percent disabling under DC 5260. In addressing the Veteran's claim for an increased rating for the right knee condition, the Board first notes that, effective February 7, 2021, VA revised the criteria for evaluating disabilities of the musculoskeletal system. See Schedule for Rating Disabilities: Musculoskeletal System and Muscle Injuries, 85 Fed. Reg. 76453, 76464 (Nov. 30, 2020); Correction, 86 Fed. Reg. 8142, 8143 (Feb. 4, 2021). This amendment affected the evaluations of knee disabilities. As the Veteran filed his current increased rating claim after the amended codes went in effect, the Board finds that it must apply the amended criteria in this case.

Under 38 C.F.R § 4.71a, DC 5260, noncompensable, 10 percent, 20 percent, and 30 percent ratings are assigned for flexion limited to 60, 45, 30, and 15 degrees, respectively. Relatedly, under DC 5261, noncompensable, 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent, 40 percent, and 50 percent ratings are assigned for extension limited to 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 45 degrees, respectively.

Additionally, under 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5257, the amended criteria for recurrent patellar instability, a 10 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability (with or without history of surgical repair) that does not require a prescription from a medical provider for a brace, cane, or walker. A 20 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for one of the following: a brace, cane, or walker. A 30 percent rating is warranted for a diagnosed condition involving the patellofemoral complex with recurrent instability after surgical repair that requires a prescription by a medical provider for a brace and either a cane or a walker. 

For patellar instability, the patellofemoral complex consists of the quadriceps tendon, the patella, and the patellar tendon. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257, Note (1). A surgical procedure that does not involve repair of one or more patellofemoral components that contribute to the underlying instability shall not qualify as surgical repair for patellar instability (including, but not limited to, arthroscopy to remove loose bodies and joint aspiration). 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257, Note (2).

Diagnostic Codes 5258 and 5259 are assigned for symptoms associated with removal or dislocation of semilunar cartilage. Specifically, Diagnostic Code 5258 is assigned for frequent episodes of locking, pain, and effusion of the knee joint. Diagnostic Code 5259 is assigned for symptoms of a lesser degree than those contemplated by Diagnostic Code 5258.

In Lyles v. Shulkin, the Court held that evaluation of a knee disability under the diagnostic codes for recurrent subluxation or instability; limitation of extension; or limitation of flexion does not preclude as a matter of law a separate evaluation of a meniscal disability under Diagnostic Code 5258 or 5259. 29 Vet. App. 107, 115-16 (2017). Thus, separate ratings can be assigned for knee disabilities when none of the symptomatology overlaps and the separate rating is based on additional disabling symptomatology; this includes separate ratings based on limitation of flexion (Diagnostic Code 5260), limitation of extension (Diagnostic Code 5261), lateral instability or recurrent subluxation (Diagnostic Code 5257), and meniscal conditions (Diagnostic Codes 5258, 5259). See VAOPGCPREC 23-97, 62 Fed. Reg. 63, 603 (1997); VAOPGCPREC 9-98, 63 Fed. Reg. 56, 703 (1998); VAOPGCPREC 9-2004; 69 Fed. Reg. 59, 988 (2004); Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107 (2017), supra.

Turning to the medical evidence, the Veteran was provided a VA examination in January 2024. At the January 2024 examination, the Veteran reported severe knee pain during flare-ups and stated that he used stretching and Ibuprofen to alleviate symptoms. He reported that his flare-ups occurred two to three times per week and were precipitated by prolonged walking and standing. He also reported that he experienced knee instability. Interestingly, the examiner noted that he did not report any functional loss or have a history frequent knee swelling. 

Range of motion testing revealed right knee flexion limited to no less than 110 degrees, and the examiner noted that he exhibited signs of pain during his flexion range of motion testing. However, the testing revealed that his extension was normal with no signs of pain. The January 2024 VA examiner also stated that the Veteran experienced pain with weight-bearing, non weight-bearing, active motion, passive motion, and on rest/non-movement, but that his pain did not result in functional loss. The examiner also noted that there was objective evidence of crepitus. 

Although the examiner noted that the Veteran did not experience functional loss due to pain, he noted that the Veteran did experience functional loss after three repetitions due to pain, fatigability, and lack of endurance. The examiner stated that after repeated use over time and during flare-ups, the evidence suggested pain, weakness, and lack of endurance significantly limits functional ability. However, the examiner estimates that the flexion endpoint remained at 110 degrees. 

Based on this evidence, and resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, as is required by law, the Board finds that without the use of pain medication (Ibuprofen), the Veteran's right knee flexion would be limited to 30 degrees after repeated use over time and during flare-ups. See Ingram v. Collins, No. 23-1798 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327 (March 12, 2025) (holding that the Board must discount the beneficial effects of medication when the relevant rating criteria do not explicitly contemplate medication use). The Board acknowledges that the January 2024 VA examiner stated that the Veteran did not report any functional loss caused by his right knee condition. The examination report, however, indicated that the Veteran experienced functional loss due to pain, weakness, lack of endurance. The examiner also opined that the right knee condition interfered with his standing, disturbed his ambulation, and caused less movement than normal. Further, the examiner observed signs of pain during weight-bearing, non weight-bearing, on rest and non-movement, active motion, and passive motion. In Chavis v. McDonough, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) instructed the Board to consider 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45 to fully understand the nature of a veteran's disability. 34 Vet. App. 1, 10 (2021). Section 4.40 indicates that disability is the inability to perform normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance. Section 4.45 explains that reduced patterns of normal joint movement may include more or less than normal movement, weakened movement, excess fatigability, impaired ability to move smoothly and precisely, pain on movement, and other factors. Taking these provisions into consideration, and the findings of the VA examination, the Board concludes that if the Veteran did not take pain medication, right knee flexion would be limited beyond 110 degrees. As there is no competent evidence estimating the degree of motion that would be lost without the use of pain medication, the Board resolves doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds that flexion would be limited to 30 degrees, consistent with the criteria for the next higher rating of 20 percent. A rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted, as at no point during the appeal period on appeal has the evidence demonstrated a limitation of flexion to 15 degrees, as is required for a rating higher than 20 percent. 

The Board also finds that the Veteran is entitled to a separate10 percent rating for symptomatic removal of semilunar cartilage effective January 8, 2024 pursuant to DC 5259. Specifically, the record demonstrates that the Veteran underwent a meniscectomy in 2020. Also, the January 2024 VA examiner noted that the Veteran experienced swelling in his right knee, which the examiner attributed to his meniscal condition. Based on these findings, the Board finds that a separate 10 percent rating for symptomatic removal of semilunar cartilage is warranted under DC 5259. This is the maximum available rating under this diagnostic code.

In terms of the assignment of January 8, 2024 as the effective date for his increased ratings, the Board finds that this is the date of claim. Generally, in the increased rating context, VA is to assign as the effective date the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1). Further, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2), VA may assign a retroactive effective date up to one year prior to the date of receipt of claim if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred within the year prior to the claim's filing. Here, prior to filing the increased rating claim, there are no medical records showing an increase in severity of the right knee condition in the one-year look back period. His private treatment records document his 2020 meniscectomy, and his symptoms leading up to this surgery. However, as these records pre-date the one-year look back period, the Board finds that they do not demonstrate worsening during the period on appeal. Moreover, his VA treatment records also do not show worsening of the right knee condition. Thus, the Board finds that January 8, 2024 is the applicable effective date for the assignment of the increased 20 percent rating for limited flexion and the separate 10 percent rating for the symptomatic meniscal condition. 

The Board has also considered whether the Veteran is entitled to separate evaluations under additional diagnostic codes at any point during the period on appeal. However, there is no evidence demonstrating that he is entitled to separate rating under any additional diagnostic codes. Turning to DC 5261 for limited extension, the Board notes that there were no signs of painful extension or impairment with extension at the VA examination or in his medical records. Additionally, for DC 5256, which pertains to ankylosis of the knee, the Board finds that he is not entitled to separate ratings under this diagnostic code. Diagnostic Code 5260 allows for the assignment of disability ratings based on limitation of flexion. Flexion is the "act of bending or condition of being bent." Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 725 (31st ed. 2007). Further, ankylosis is "immobility and consolidation of a joint due to disease, injury, surgical procedure." Ankylosis is a greater degree of limitation of motion (i.e., immobility or complete limitation of motion) and necessarily includes all lesser limitation of motion, including limitation of flexion. To assign ratings under both diagnostic codes would violate the rules prohibiting pyramiding. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.14; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261 (1994). The Board has also considered whether he is entitled to compensable rating under DC 5257, but the record does not show any diagnoses of a sprain, or partial or complete ligament tear as required by the amended criteria. Therefore, although the examiner noted that he experienced instability, the Board noted that this examiner did not diagnose him with a ligament tear as required for a separate evaluation under the amended criteria of DC 5257.  The Board has also considered whether the Veteran is entitled to a rating under DC 5258 because he reported swelling and pain, but the record does not show that he contended that his right knee locks up. Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that he is not entitled to separate evaluations under any additional diagnostic codes.

As a final note, the January 2024 VA examiner noted that the right knee condition caused low back pain. However, the Veteran is already service connected for a lumbosacral strain effective November 12, 2014. See February 2024 Rating Decision - Codesheet. Accordingly, the Board finds that it has compensated the Veteran for all symptoms related to his right knee condition, to the extent allowed by 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.
