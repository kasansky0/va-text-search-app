ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a bilateral knee condition is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's April 2024 VA Form 10182 was an improper concurrent election as it sought to appeal a March 2024 rating decision denying entitlement to service connection for a bilateral knee condition while a higher-level review request of the same March 2024 rating decision was pending.

2. During the pendency of the appeal, the Veteran was granted service connection for a bilateral knee condition in a July 2024 rating decision.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal of entitlement to service connection for a bilateral knee condition are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(b), 20.205. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from April 2000 to March 2001.  

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a VA Regional Office, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).    

Dismissal

By way of background, the Veteran filed a service connection claim for a bilateral knee condition in June 2023 which was subsequently denied in a September 2023 rating decision.  Soon thereafter in November 2023, the Veteran filed a new claim, a supplemental claim, and a request for higher-level review for his claimed bilateral knee condition.  November 2023 VA 21-526EZ; November 2023 VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim; November 2023 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review.  A March 2024 Deferred Rating decision indicated the Veteran's November 2023 VA 21-526EZ was invalid and that it was further unclear whether the Veteran desired to pursue his service connection claim via his November 2023 supplemental claim or November 2023 request for higher-level review.  Accordingly, further clarification was needed.  March 2024 Deferred Rating Decision.    

The AOJ nonetheless continued to deny the Veteran's November 2023 supplemental claim in a March 2024 Rating Decision.  The AOJ thereafter held a Higher-Level Review informal conference on March 27, 2024, wherein it was stated that clarification was never obtained as to which review lane the Veteran preferred.  The Veteran confirmed that he desired his additional evidence to be considered with his filed supplemental claim and that he could submit an additional higher-level review request after receiving the supplemental claim decision.  March 2024 HLR - Informal Conference.  

The Veteran thereafter filed an April 2024, VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review of the March 2024 rating decision denying his supplemental claim.  The Veteran thereafter filed an April 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) appealing the same March 2024 rating decision.  The Board notes the Veteran also listed the prior September 2023 rating decision that originally denied the Veteran's service connection claim.  April 2024 NOD.  The Board issued a May 2024 Docketing Letter placing the Veteran's appeal on the Direct Review docket.  

Per the Veteran's April 2024 request for higher-level review, the AOJ issued a rating decision in July 2024 granting service connection for the Veteran's claimed bilateral knee condition.  Specifically, the Veteran was awarded service connection for left and right knee strains with respective evaluations of 10 percent, effective June 22, 2023.  July 2024 Rating Decision.  In August 2024, the Veteran's representative submitted an Appellate Brief stating that the Veteran had been granted service connection for left and right knee strains since the filing of his April 2024 NOD and that the issue currently on appeal had been resolved in the Veteran's favor.  August 2024 Appellate Brief.  

The Board thereafter issued a letter in January 2025 explaining that the Veteran's April 2024 NOD had been erroneously docketed as the Veteran had previously requested higher-level review for the same issue.  The Board further noted that service connection for a bilateral knee disability had been granted in the July 2024 rating decision.  The Board stated that the Veteran had 60 days from the date of the letter to respond if he disagreed with the Board's determination that his Board appeal request was invalid.  January 2025 BVA Letter.  No response has been received.  

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500, claimants may elect to review a decision by the AOJ by filing a supplemental claim, Higher Level Review (HLR) request, or Board appeal. The Veteran, however, is prohibited from concurrently requesting both types of review. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

The Board also acknowledges that the Court has held that a claimant may seek a second administrative review option with respect to the same decision on the claim, so long as the 1-year period from that decision has not run.  Terry v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023).  Even so, the Veteran may not seek both review options concurrently.  Id. at 2.  In other words, a second administrative review is permissible if it is timely, and it does not run concurrently with the first administrative review option.  Id.; see also 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A).

Here, a March 2024 rating decision denied the Veteran's service connection claim for a bilateral knee condition.  In April 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996 Higher Level Review (HLR) request regarding the March 2024 rating decision denying his service connection claim for a bilateral knee condition.  While the Veteran's HLR request remained pending, the Veteran thereafter submitted an April VA Form 10182 attempting to appeal the same March 2024 rating decision.  Accordingly, the Board finds the April 2024 VA Form 10182 was an impermissible concurrent election, and the docketing of the appeal was in error.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b); see Terry, 37 Vet. App. 1 (2023).

The Board has considered the applicability of any waiver of the prohibition on concurrent election.  See generally, Ferko v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 262 (2024) (en banc) (holding the one-year deadline to file a legacy NOD is not a jurisdictional bar to Board review, but a mandatory claims processing rule); see also Hall v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 329, 332 (2022) (regulatory claims-processing rules may be waived without affecting jurisdiction to adjudicate appeal); Percy v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 37, 45 (2009) (VA may implicitly or explicitly waive any issue of timeliness in the filing of a Substantive Appeal).  The Board still retains subject-matter jurisdiction over claims on appeal when claims-processing rules are not followed; it is the Board's duty to engage in factfinding and explain the basis for any waiver or forfeiture of the relevant claims-processing rules.  Hall, 34 Vet. App. at 333.

In particular, the Board considered whether it waived its right to enforce the prohibition on concurrent election by virtue of docketing the appeal.  See, e.g., Percy, 23 Vet. App. at 46-47 (holding VA waived any objection to the timeliness of the legacy substantive appeal because "VA consistently treated th[e] matter as if it was part of the timely filed Substantive Appeal[]" for over five years....").

On May 1, 2024, the Board sent a letter placing the Veteran's April 2024 NOD on the Direct Review docket.  The Board finds that assigning the appeal a docket in and of itself does not constitute a waiver of the prohibition of concurrent election.  Indeed, whether the Board has waived any objection to a concurrent election should be based on all facts and circumstances of that case.  Accord Percy, 23 Vet. App. at 46 (discussing VA's actions in that case in finding VA had treated the substantive appeal as timely filed).

Here, although the Board completed the ministerial action of docketing the appeal, unlike the circumstances of Percy, the Board did not continuously "engage in substantive and procedural development" of the appeal.  There were no further communications, no hearing held, no action in which the Veteran would be under the impression that the merits of the case were examined and being developed in any substantive way.  Indeed, the Board sent the Veteran a January 2025 letter stating that his appeal was docketed in error.  Furthermore, the Veteran's service connection claim for a bilateral knee condition remained under development at the AOJ level at the time the Veteran filed the April 2024 NOD, and the Veteran was subsequently granted service connection for a bilateral knee condition in a July 2024 rating decision.  Accordingly, the Board finds that there has been no waiver of the prohibition on concurrent election under the facts and circumstances of this case.

Finally, to the extent that the prohibition on concurrent election could be considered waived, the Board finds the July 2024 rating decision nonetheless constitutes a full grant of the benefit sought in the present appeal, service connection for the Veteran's bilateral knee disability.  See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

Accordingly, the Board finds the attempted appeal must be dismissed as the April 2023 VA Form 10182 was an impermissible concurrent election and no waiver (implicit or explicit) was made.  Furthermore, as the Veteran has since been granted service connection for a bilateral knee disability, the appeal must be dismissed as a matter of law as there remains no adverse action in which the Veteran disagrees.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.
