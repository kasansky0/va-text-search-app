FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran has been receiving the maximum schedular rating for tinnitus since October 13, 2006. The evidence in this case does not show such an exceptional disability picture that the assigned schedular evaluation for tinnitus is inadequate.

2. Audiometric examinations correspond to no greater than a level IV hearing loss for the right ear, and no greater than a level III hearing loss for the left ear.

3. The Veteran's PTSD had not resulted in total occupational and social impairment due to gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living; disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name.

4. For the period prior to January 16, 2018, the Veteran's diabetes mellitus required only restricted diet.

5. For the period since January 16, 2018, the Veteran's type II diabetes mellitus treatment does not require regulation of activities. 

6. The Veteran has already been provided consideration of the General Rating Formula under Diseases of the Heart for his service-connected ischemic heart disease. 

7. For the period since May 1, 2014, the Veteran's atrial fibrillation with bradycardia required the installation of a pacemaker, but the Veteran denied experiencing symptoms attributable to supraventricular arrhythmias, ventricular arrhythmias, or atrioventricular block.

8. The Veteran's surgical scar, pacemaker implantation disability has not been shown to occupy an area or areas of 39 square inches or greater. 

9.  The earliest date of entitlement for the Veteran's claim for ischemic heart disease is the date of diagnosis on April 29, 2013.

10. The earliest date of entitlement for the Veteran's claims for atrial fibrillation with bradycardia status post implanted cardiac pacemaker and for scar status-post pacemaker implant surgery is the date of surgery on February 28, 2014. 

11. A June 2017 rating decision granted service connection for a type II diabetes mellitus disability, effective March 23, 2017. The effective date was the date of the claim for service connection.

12. There is not clear evidence of any administrative irregularity by the agency of original jurisdiction, and VA received no communication from the Veteran, or any authorized representative, that constitutes a formal claim for a type II diabetes mellitus disability prior to March 23, 2017.

13. The Veteran filed a supplemental service connection claim for diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper and lower extremities on March 29, 2019. 

14. The Veteran's claim for service connection for diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper and lower extremities was granted by the AOJ and an effective date of March 29, 2019, was assigned.

15. Prior to March 29, 2019, there was no formal or informal service connection claim for diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper and lower extremities disabilities that remained pending.

16. The criteria for basic eligibility for DEA under Title 38, United States Code, Chapter 35, are met as of April 29, 2013.

17. The Veteran is in receipt of SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s) based on a 100 percent disability rating for ischemic heart disease and a 70 percent disability rating for PTSD, thereby rendering entitlement to TDIU moot.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from March 1969 to September 1970. 

In May 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of claims most recently addressed in June 2021, March 2022 and June 2022 rating decisions. In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision. 

The Board notes that in March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a February 2024 decision regarding increased ratings for diabetes mellitus and a TDIU. In June 2024, the AOJ issued the June 204 HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior February 2024 decision.

In the October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of service connection for Parkinson's disease, entitlement to earlier effective dates prior to February 28, 2014 to April 30, 2014, and prior to April 12, 2017 for entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate and entitlement to an effective date prior to April 29, 2013, for entitlement to eligibility to DEA under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of this claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Notably, in a November 2024 correspondence, VA informed the Veteran that he had the right to select a different Board review option by submitting a new VA Form 10182 within one year of the original AOJ decision or within 60 days of the date that VA received his VA Form 10182, whichever was later.

However, in the October 2024 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran's representative had already specifically waived the right to select a different Board review option. As a result, the appeal remains in the Direct Review Lane.

       Increased Ratings

Laws and Regulations

The Board must assess the credibility and weight of all evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant.  Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; every item of evidence does not have the same probative value.  

Disability evaluations are determined by evaluating the extent to which a Veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  The percentage ratings represent as far as can practicably be determined the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from such diseases and injuries and the residual conditions in civilian occupations.  Generally, the degree of disabilities specified are considered adequate to compensate for considerable loss of working time from exacerbation or illness proportionate to the severity of the several grades of disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1 (2012).  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities and the criteria for specific ratings.  If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned to the disability picture that more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7 (2021).  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3 (2021). 

The Veteran's entire history is reviewed when making a disability determination.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1 (2021).  Where service connection has already been established, and increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the present level of the disability that is of primary concern.  See Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55 (1994). However, in Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999), it was held that evidence to be considered in the appeal of an initial assignment of a disability rating was not limited to that reflecting the then current severity of the disorder.  The Court also discussed the concept of the "staging" of ratings, finding that, in cases where an initially assigned disability evaluation has been disagreed with, it was possible for a veteran to be awarded separate percentage evaluations for separate periods based on the facts found during the appeal period.  See also Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2008).

In this case, the Veteran is competent to testify on factual matters of which he has first-hand knowledge.  Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362 (2005).  He is also competent to report symptoms of his tinnitus, bilateral hearing loss, PTSD, diabetes mellitus, heart and scar disabilities.  Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-71 (1994). The Veteran is competent to describe his symptoms and their effects on employment or daily activities.  

Tinnitus

The Veteran contends that his bilateral tinnitus is more severe than the rating depicts.

Ten percent is the maximum schedular rating for tinnitus, regardless of whether the tinnitus affects one or both ears.  38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6260. Effective on June 13, 2003, Diagnostic Code 6260 for tinnitus was revised to clarify existing VA practice that only a single 10 percent evaluation is assigned for "recurrent" tinnitus, whether the sound is perceived as being in one ear, both ears, or in the head.  38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Note (2); 68 Fed. Reg. 25,822 (June 2003); see also Smith v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006). 

The Veteran has been receiving the maximum schedular rating for tinnitus since October 13, 2006, the effective date of the grant of service connection for tinnitus.  Thus, a higher schedular rating is not warranted. Under these circumstances, the disposition of this claim is based on the law, and not the facts of the case, and the claim for an increased schedular rating must be denied based on a lack of entitlement under the law.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).

The Board has also considered the potential application of other various provisions, including 38 C.F.R. § 3.321 (b)(1), for exceptional cases where schedular evaluations are found to be inadequate. See Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). Under Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111 (2008), there is a three-step inquiry for determining whether a veteran is entitled to an extraschedular rating.  First, the Board must determine whether the evidence presents such an exceptional disability picture that the available schedular evaluations for that service-connected disability are inadequate. Second, if the schedular evaluation does not contemplate a veteran's level of disability and symptomatology and is found inadequate, the Board must determine whether a veteran's disability picture exhibits other related factors such as those provided by the regulation as "governing norms." Third, if the rating schedule is inadequate to evaluate a Veteran's disability picture and that picture has attendant thereto related factors such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization, then the case must be referred to the Under Secretary for Benefits or the Director of the Compensation and Pension Service to determine whether, to accord justice, a veteran's disability picture requires the assignment of an extraschedular rating.

With respect to the first prong of Thun, the evidence in this case does not show such an exceptional disability picture that the available schedular evaluation for the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus is inadequate. A comparison between the level of severity and symptomatology of the Veteran's disability, ringing in the ears, with the established criteria shows that the rating criteria more than reasonably describe the Veteran's disability level and symptomatology. The criteria specifically provide for evaluation of the disability based upon recurrent tinnitus, and they practicably represent the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from the Veteran's service-connected disability. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. 

The Board, therefore, has determined that an extra-schedular rating pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.321 (b)(1) is not warranted. The weight of evidence reflects that there is not such an exceptional disability picture that the available schedular evaluation for the service-connected tinnitus is inadequate.

For the reasons and bases set forth above, the Board concludes that the most probative evidence weighs against finding that a rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is warranted. Therefore, the evidence is persuasively against the claim, and it is denied.

Bilateral Hearing Loss

The Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating that was received by VA in December 2020. 

The Veteran currently has a 10 percent disability rating for bilateral hearing loss under Diagnostic Code 6100.

A rating for hearing loss is determined by a mechanical application of the rating schedule to the numeric designations assigned based on audiometric test results.  Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992).

Under the rating criteria, the basic method of rating bilateral hearing loss is based on examination results including a controlled speech discrimination test (Maryland CNC), and a pure tone audiometric test of pure tone decibel thresholds at 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz with an average pure tone threshold obtained by dividing these thresholds by four.

Once these test results have been obtained, employing Table VI, a Roman numeral designation of auditory acuity level for hearing impairment is ascertained based on a combination of the percent of speech discrimination and pure tone threshold average.  Once a Roman numeral designation of auditory acuity level for each ear has been determined, Table VII is used to determine the percentage evaluation for bilateral hearing loss by combining the Roman numeral designations of auditory acuity level for hearing impairment of each ear.  38 C.F.R. § 4.85. 

There is an alternative method of rating hearing loss in defined instances of exceptional hearing loss.  In such exceptional cases, the Roman numeral designation for hearing loss of an ear may be based only on pure tone threshold average, using Table VIA, or from Table VI, whichever results in the higher Roman numeral.  Exceptional hearing exists when the pure tone threshold at the frequencies of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz is 55 decibels or more; or where the pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz, and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz. The higher Roman numeral, determined from Table VI or VIA, will then be elevated to the next higher Roman numeral.  Each ear will be evaluated separately.  38 C.F.R. § 4.86.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in March 2021.  On air conduction testing, audiological evaluation pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

			HERTZ		

	1000	2000	3000	4000	Average

RIGHT	40	50	60	70	55

LEFT	40	60	70	80	63

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 80 percent in the right ear and of 84 percent in the left ear.

Applying the air conduction results to the applicable criteria, under Table VI, the right ear pure tone threshold average of 55 decibels combined with the right ear speech discrimination of 80 percent results in a Roman numeral designation of IV, while the left ear pure tone threshold average of 63 decibels when combined with the left ear speech recognition of 84 percent results in a Roman numeral designation of III. I Application of these findings to Table VII corresponds to a 10 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.

As the March 2021 testing results noted above do not yield findings to support assignment of a rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral hearing loss, the Veteran is not entitled to an increased rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral hearing loss. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.7, 4.21.  

Notably, aside from the March 2021 VA examination reports, there are no other audiometric testing results which comply with the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 4.85 for rating purposes.  

The Board has carefully considered the Veteran's assertions and other lay statements of record and in no way discounts the Veteran's asserted difficulties or his assertions that his bilateral hearing loss should be rated higher.  However, as noted above, the March 2021 examination was conducted in accordance with the requirements for a hearing impairment examination for VA purposes.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85(a) (2021).

The lay statements are both competent and credible in regard to reporting worsening hearing acuity and functional effects. However, far more probative of the degree of the disability are the results of testing prepared by skilled professionals because the schedular criteria are predicated on audiological findings rather than subjective reports of severity of hearing loss. In essence, lay statements are of limited probative value.  As a layperson, the Veteran is competent to report difficulties with his hearing; however, he is not competent to assign particular speech recognition scores or pure tone decibel readings to his current acuity problems.

Although the Veteran has indicated that his hearing is worse than the criteria associated with the assigned evaluations, the rating criteria for hearing loss, as addressed above, requires the mechanical application of rating criteria to objectively-obtained audiometric testing results.  See Lendenmann v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 345 (1992).  The current noncompensable evaluation is reflected by the rating evidence of record and there is no indication that the findings on the March 2021 VA audiological examination are inadequate.  Thus, the Veteran's claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral hearing loss cannot be granted.

According to the regulation, an extraschedular disability rating is warranted based upon a finding that the case presents such an exceptional or unusual disability picture with such related factors as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization that would render impractical the application of the regular schedular standards.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b) (1) (2021). An exceptional case is said to include such factors as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization as to render impracticable the application of the regular schedular standards.  See Fanning v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 225, 229 (1993).

Under Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111 (2008), there is a three-step inquiry for determining whether a veteran is entitled to an extraschedular rating. First, the Board must determine whether the evidence presents such an exceptional disability picture that the available schedular evaluations for that service-connected disability are inadequate. Second, if the schedular evaluation does not contemplate the Veteran's level of disability and symptomatology and is found inadequate, the Board must determine whether the Veteran's disability picture exhibits other related factors such as those provided by the regulation as "governing norms."  Third, if the rating schedule is inadequate to evaluate a Veteran's disability picture and that picture has attendant thereto related factors such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization, then the case must be referred to the Under Secretary for Benefits or the Director of the Compensation and Pension Service to determine whether, to accord justice, the Veteran's disability picture requires the assignment of an extraschedular rating.

With respect to the first prong of Thun, the evidence in this case does not show such an exceptional disability picture that the available schedular evaluations for the service-connected bilateral hearing loss were inadequate. A comparison between the level of severity and symptomatology of the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss with the established criteria shows that the rating criteria reasonably described his disability level and symptomatology with respect to the symptoms he experienced. 

During his March 2021 audiological examination, the VA examiner noted that the Veteran's hearing loss impacted his ordinary conditions of daily life, including his ability to work as the examiner noted that without amplification, the Veteran would have difficulty understanding any speech at a normal level.  

In this case, the Board finds that the schedular rating currently assigned for hearing loss reasonably describes the Veteran's disability level and symptomatology.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.85, Diagnostic Code 6100.  The Veteran reports that he's had decreased hearing since his military service. The Court has held that the rating criteria for hearing loss contemplate the functional effects of decreased hearing and difficulty understanding speech in an everyday work environment as these are precisely the effects that VA's audiometric tests are designed to measure. Doucette v. Shulkin, No. 15-2818, 2017 WL 877340, at *3 (Vet. App. Mar. 6, 2017). The situations noted by the Veteran in this case amount to decreased hearing and are not exceptional or unusual for someone with hearing loss. In Doucette, the Court recognized that there were other functional effects the rating criteria did not discuss or account for, such as dizziness, vertigo, ear pain, recurrent loss of balance, social isolation, etc.  Id., at *3, *4. No such effects related to hearing loss are present in this case.  

The Veteran's description of difficulty hearing has been measured according to pure tone averages and speech discrimination. As explained above, the rating criteria are designed to take into account testing that accurately measures difficulty hearing in an objective way and the Veteran's reports of difficulty hearing simply do not represent an exceptional or unusual case. As such, the first Thun element cannot be met.  

Accordingly, the Board has concluded that referral of the Veteran's bilateral hearing loss impairment for extra-schedular consideration is not in order.

Under Johnson v. McDonald, 762 F.3d 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2014), a Veteran may be awarded an extraschedular rating based upon the combined effect of multiple conditions in an exceptional circumstance where the evaluation of the individual conditions fails to capture all the service-connected disabilities experienced.  In this case, the Veteran has multiple service-connected disabilities, but there is no argument or indication that the combination of these disabilities is so exceptional as to warrant extraschedular consideration. As such, further discussion of an extraschedular rating based upon the combined effect of multiple conditions is not necessary.  See Yancy v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 484, 495 (2016) ("the Board is required to address whether referral for extraschedular consideration is warranted for a veteran's disabilities on a collective basis only when that issue is argued by the claimant or reasonably raised by the record through evidence of the collective impact of the claimant's service-connected disabilities").

In short, the rating criteria reasonably describe the Veteran's disabilities level and symptomatology.  The Board, therefore, has determined that referral of this case for extraschedular consideration pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b) (1) is not warranted.

As a result, the Board finds that entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for bilateral hearing loss is not warranted. 

PTSD

The Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating that was received by VA in December 2020. 

The Veteran currently has a 70 percent disability rating under Diagnostic Code 9411 for his service-connected PTSD.

The Board notes that psychiatric disabilities other than eating disorders are rated pursuant to the criteria for General Rating Formula.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. 

Under the general rating formula for mental disorders, a noncompensable rating is assigned when a mental condition has been formally diagnosed, but symptoms are not severe enough to either require continuous medication, or to interfere with occupational and social functioning.

A 50 percent rating requires occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.

A 70 percent rating requires occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affected the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.

A 100 percent rating is assigned when there is total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  Id. 

The evidence considered in determining the level of impairment for psychiatric disorders under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 is not restricted to the symptoms provided in the rating code.  Disability ratings are assigned according to the manifestation of particular symptoms, but the use of the term "such as" in the General Rating Formula demonstrates that the symptoms after the phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather are to serve as examples of the type and degree of the symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating.  Accordingly, the evidence considered in determining the level of impairment from psychiatric disorder under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 is not restricted to the symptoms provided in Diagnostic Code 9411.  See Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002). 

When evaluating the level of disability from a mental disorder, the rating agency will consider the extent of social impairment but shall not assign an evaluation solely on the basis of social impairment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.126 (2020).

Factual Background and Analysis

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in March 2021. The examiner determined that the Veteran had occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity. The Veteran currently lived with his wife and the relationship had improved greatly. His relationship with his daughter had improved and he had several friends. He was retired and not taking any courses. His symptoms included anxiety, depressed mood, suspiciousness, chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss, impairment of short and long term memory, disturbances of motivation and mood and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances. He was alert and oriented in all spheres and was appropriately groomed and hygienic. He was cooperative and interactive throughout the entire evaluation. There was no current evidence of hallucinations or delusions and he denied suicidal plan or intent. 

After reviewing evidence of record as a whole, the Board finds that the assignment of a disability rating greater than 70 percent for the Veteran's PTSD is not warranted.

In not granting a 100 percent schedular rating for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD, the Board is not minimizing the severity of the Veteran's symptoms. The Board notes that the evidence demonstrates that the Veteran experienced significant social impairment as a result of his PTSD. 

Also, while treatment records demonstrate that the Veteran experienced significant occupational and social impairment, the Board again notes that the maximum rating of 100 percent requires total occupational and social impairment. 

Significantly, at no point did any VA examiner or treating physician find that the Veteran's PTSD caused total occupational and social impairment, as is required for the assignment of a 100 percent rating. 

As noted above, the maximum rating of 100 percent requires total occupational and social impairment. The VA treatment records and the March 2021 VA examination show no gross impairment in thought processes or communication, grossly inappropriate behavior, persistent danger of hurting self or others, disorientation to time or place, or memory loss for names of own relatives, own occupation, or own name. Additionally, the VA examiner also noted that the Veteran was in an improved relationship with his wife and had several friends. 

Additionally, the March 2021 VA examiner specifically described the Veteran's symptoms as occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity, which fits squarely for the criteria for a 50 percent evaluation under the General Rating Formula.  

Despite the fact that this description actually corresponds squarely with lesser disability ratings, the Board will not disturb the currently assigned 70 percent disability rating for PTSD. However, a rating in excess of 70 percent is not available based on these findings.

Accordingly, in this case, the overall evidence of record does not reflect that the Veteran's symptomatology is so severe as to merit a 100 percent disability rating. 

Thus, for all the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that a rating in excess of 70 percent for PTSD is not warranted.

Diabetes Mellitus

The Veteran filed a claim for an increased rating that was received by VA in May 2018. 

The Veteran currently has a 10 percent disability rating for diabetes mellitus for the period prior to January 16, 2018, and a 20 percent rating for the period since January 16, 2018, under Diagnostic Code 7913.

Under Diagnostic Code 7913, a rating of 10 percent is warranted if diabetes is manageable by restricted diet only, a 20 percent rating is warranted for diabetes requiring insulin and a restricted diet, or oral hypoglycemic agents and a restricted diet; a 40 percent rating is warranted when the diabetes requires insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities; a 60 percent rating is warranted when the diabetes requires insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring one or two hospitalizations per year or twice a month visits to a diabetic care provider, plus complications that would not be compensable if separately evaluated; and a 100 percent rating when the diabetes requires more than one daily injection of insulin, restricted diet, and regulation of activities (avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities), with episodes of ketoacidosis or hypoglycemic reactions requiring at least three hospitalizations per year or weekly visits to a diabetic care provider, plus either progressive loss of weight and strength or complications that would be compensable if separately evaluated.  38 C.F.R. § 4.119, Diagnostic Code 7913. 

Complications of diabetes are evaluated separately unless they are part of the criteria used to support a 100 percent rating.  Noncompensable complications are deemed part of the diabetic process under Diagnostic Code 7913.  38 C.F.R. § 4.119, Diagnostic Code 7913, Note (1).

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in May 2017.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's diabetes was managed by a restricted diet. However, the Veteran did not require insulin or the regulation of activities as part of his medical management of his diabetes.  He visited his diabetic care provider less than 2 times a month for episodes of ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia and needed no hospitalizations in the past 12 months.  He did not have progressive unintentional weight loss or loss of strength attributable to his diabetes. The examiner also found that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus did not impact his ability to work.  

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in April 2018.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's diabetes was managed by a restricted diet and prescribed oral hypoglycemic agent. However, the Veteran did not require regulation of activities as part of his medical management of his diabetes.  He visited his diabetic care provider less than 2 times a month for episodes of ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia and needed no hospitalizations in the past 12 months.  He did not have progressive unintentional weight loss or loss of strength attributable to his diabetes. The examiner also found that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus did not impact his ability to work.  

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in March 2021.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's diabetes was managed by a restricted diet and a prescribed oral hypoglycemic agent. However, the Veteran did not require regulation of activities as part of his medical management of his diabetes.  He visited his diabetic care provider less than 2 times a month for episodes of ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia and needed no hospitalizations in the past 12 months.  He did not have progressive unintentional weight loss or loss of strength attributable to his diabetes. The examiner also found that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus did not impact his ability to work.  

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in July 2023.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's diabetes was managed by a prescribed oral hypoglycemic agent. However, the Veteran did not require regulation of activities as part of his medical management of his diabetes.  He visited his diabetic care provider less than 2 times a month for episodes of ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia and needed no hospitalizations in the past 12 months.  He did not have progressive unintentional weight loss or loss of strength attributable to his diabetes. The examiner also found that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus impacted his ability to work as he had limitations related to lightheadedness, nausea and dizziness as well as generalized fatigue.

Period prior to January 16, 2018

Based on the evidence, the Board does not find that the Veteran is entitled to an evaluation in excess of the current 10 percent disability rating for his service-connected type II diabetes mellitus disability for the period prior to January 16, 2018.

Notably, the Veteran's treatment records during this time period do not indicate the use of insulin or show that the criteria for a higher rating have been met. As reflected above, the May 2017 VA examination noted that the Veteran's diabetes was managed by a restricted diet but did not require insulin or the regulation of activities as part of his medical management of his diabetes.

Ultimately the record does not substantiate entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for the Veteran's diabetes as the weight of the probative evidence of record does not establish that any of the criteria required for a rating higher than 10 percent have been met.

In rendering a decision, the Board has considered all evidence of record including the Veteran's contentions and lay statements. While the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms of diabetes mellitus, even considering the Veteran's lay statements and all of the evidence of record, the Board does not find that the severity of the Veteran's diabetes more nearly approximates a rating in excess of 10 percent under Diagnostic Code 7913 or any other applicable diagnostic code for the period prior to January 16, 2018.

Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim of entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for diabetes mellitus for the period prior to January 16, 2018. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply and a higher rating for diabetes mellitus is not warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Period since January 16, 2018

Based on the evidence, the Board does not find that the Veteran is entitled to an evaluation in excess of the current 20 percent disability rating for his service-connected type II diabetes mellitus disability for the period since January 16, 2018.

As noted above, in order for a 40 percent disability rating to be awarded, the service-connected diabetes mellitus must require (1) insulin, (2) a restricted diet, and (3) regulation of activities.  These criteria are conjunctive; all three elements must be met.  See Melson v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 334 (June 1991).

The evidence of record indicates that the Veteran has been prescribed oral hypoglycemic agents and the Veteran's diabetes was managed by a restricted diet.   

However, there is no evidence of restriction of activity or required insulin.  Regulation of activities is defined as "avoidance of strenuous occupational and recreational activities".  38 C.F.R. § 4.119, Diagnostic Code 7913; see also Camacho v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 360, 363 (2007).  The objective medical evidence does not show that the Veteran's diabetes mellitus results in any regulation of activities.  On the contrary, the April 2018, March 2021 and July 2023 VA examiners all specifically noted that the Veteran did not require regulation of activities as part of medical management of his diabetes.

Note 1 of diagnostic code 7913 requires that any compensable complications of diabetes be rated separately under the appropriate diagnostic code. Here, the Veteran has bilateral neuropathies and erectile dysfunction as a result of his diabetes. 

Erectile dysfunction is rated under diagnostic code 7255. However, in order to warrant a compensable rating, there must be evidence of a penis deformity with loss of erectile power. 

Here, the Veteran's January 2018, April 2018, March 2021 and July 2023 VA examinations do not note penis deformities and also reported that the Veteran reported normal anatomy. Further, the Veteran does not allege any penile deformities. Based on no evidence of a penile deformity, the Veteran is not entitled to a compensable rating under diagnostic code 7522 or any other applicable diagnostic code.

The Board also notes the Veteran is already service connected for diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the right and left lower extremities at 40 percent evaluations and for diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the right and left upper extremities at 30 percent and 20 percent evaluations. While the February 2024 rating decision denied earlier effective dates for diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper and lower extremities (issues that will be addressed below), neither the appealed February 2024 or June 2024 rating decisions addressed the disability ratings for diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper and lower extremities. Accordingly, these issues are therefore not before the Board.

The Board therefore finds the weight of the evidence is against a finding for the assignment of a schedular rating in excess of the already assigned 20 percent for diabetes under Diagnostic Code 7913 for the period since January 16, 2018. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7.

Atrial Fibrillation

In the February 2024 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for atrial fibrillation with bradycardia status post implanted cardiac pacemaker at an initial 100 percent rating, effective February 28, 2014, and then assigned an initial 10 percent rating, effective May 1, 2014, under Diagnostic Code 7018.

The Board parenthetically notes that the Veteran in his October 2024 Notice of Disagreement, indicated that he desired an increased rating for his service-connected ischemic heart disease. However, the Board notes that the Veteran is already in receipt of a maximum 100 percent rating for ischemic heart disease. 

Additionally, regarding the period prior to May 1, 2014, as a 100 percent rating is the maximum evaluation allowed for atrial fibrillation with bradycardia status post implanted cardiac pacemaker, the Board will address whether the Veteran is entitled to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for atrial fibrillation with bradycardia status post implanted cardiac pacemaker for the period since May 1, 2014. 

The Board again notes that the Veteran is currently assigned two separate ratings for his service-connected heart disability as he has a 100 percent rating for ischemic heart disease under Diagnostic Code 7005 and the current initial 10 percent rating for atrial fibrillation with bradycardia status post implanted cardiac pacemaker under Diagnostic Code 7018.

As a result, the Veteran's heart condition has been evaluated under a combination of rating criteria under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Schedule of ratings cardiovascular system, including Diagnostic Code 7005, Arteriosclerotic heart disease (coronary artery disease), and Diagnostic Code 7018, Implantable cardiac pacemakers.

Effective November 14, 2021, VA amended the rating criteria for disabilities of the cardiovascular system under 38 C.F.R. § 4.104. 86 Fed. Reg. 54089 (Sep. 30, 2021). This amended regulation applies to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after November 14, 2021. Claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both the pre- and post-amendment rating criteria, and whichever is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied. However, the Board may not apply the post-amendment rating criteria to a period prior to its effective date, unless the regulation explicitly provides otherwise. Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Conversely, the Board is not precluded from applying the pre-amendment rating criteria to a period on or after the effective date of the post-amendment rating criteria so long as it was in effect during the pendency of the appeal. As the Veteran's claim was received prior to the effective date of the regulation changes, the Board must consider the Veteran's heart disability under both the pre- and the post-amendment rating criteria and must apply the old rating criteria if it is more favorable to the Veteran. Id. Here, as both ratings are generally similar when considering the Veteran's symptoms, both the old and the amended regulations will be addressed below.

Under both versions of the rating criteria, one MET is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (2). When the level of METs at which breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, an estimation by a medical examiner of the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in those symptoms may be used. Id. 

Prior to November 14, 2021, Diagnostic Code 7005 provided a 10 percent rating where a workload of greater than 7.0 METs but not greater than 10.0 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; continuous medication is required. A 30 percent rating is warranted where a workload of greater than 5.0 METs but not greater than 7.0 METs results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; there is cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation on electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, or X-ray. A 60 percent rating is warranted where there is more than one episode of acute congestive heart failure in the past year, or; a workload of greater than 3.0 METs but not greater than 5.0 METs that results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; LVEF of 30 to 50 percent. A 100 percent rating is warranted where there is chronic congestive heart failure, or; a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in dyspnea, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope, or; LVEF of less than 30 percent.

Under the General Rating Formula effective November 14, 2021, a 10 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 7.1-10.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms, or continuous medication is required for control. A 30 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 5.1-7.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms, or where there is cardiac hypertrophy or dilatation confirmed by echocardiogram or equivalent. A 60 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.1-5.0 METs results in heart failure symptoms. A 100 percent rating is warranted where a workload of 3.0 METs or less results in heart failure symptoms.

One MET is the energy cost of standing quietly at rest and represents an oxygen uptake of 3.5 milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104.

For purposes of the General Rating Formula for Diseases of the Heart, heart failure symptoms include, but are not limited to, breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, arrhythmia, palpitations, or syncope. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Note (3).

Under the criteria in effect prior to and as of November 14, 2021, Diagnostic Code 7018 addresses implantable cardiac pacemakers and provides that for two months, which was reduced to one month as of November 14, 2021, following hospital admission for implantation or reimplantation, a 100 percent rating is warranted. Thereafter, such is to be evaluated as supraventricular arrhythmias under Diagnostic Code 7010, ventricular arrhythmias under Diagnostic Code 7011, or atrioventricular block under Diagnostic Code 7015. Such further provides that a minimum rating of 10 percent is assigned for implantable cardiac pacemakers.

Factual Background and Analysis

In October 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination. The examiner confirmed the Veteran's implanted cardiac pacemaker diagnosis. He has cardiac arrhythmia as he had bradycardia requiring pacemaker implementation. He did not have supraventricular arrhythmias or ventricular arrhythmias and did not have an atrioventricular block. He had not had pericardial adhesions or any infectious cardiac conditions, including active valvular infection (including rheumatic heart disease, endocarditis, pericarditis, or syphilitic heart disease). The Veteran had non-surgical or surgical procedures, to include, implanted cardiac pacemaker, but had not had any other hospitalizations for the treatment of his heart condition. He had a scar related to his condition. There were no other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, and/or symptoms related to the Veteran's heart condition. 

Based on the evidence of record, the Board finds that an initial rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted for the Veteran's atrial fibrillation with bradycardia status post implanted cardiac pacemaker for the period since May 1, 2014. 

As noted above, under Diagnostic Code 7018, a 100 percent rating is provided for the two months following hospital admission for implantation or reimplantation. The Board finds that the Veteran has not claimed, and the record does not reflect, that, during the period on appeal, the Veteran was hospitalized for implantation or reimplantation of a pacemaker. 

Furthermore, the Board finds that, for the remainder of the appeal period, (since May 1, 2014), the Veteran's implantation of cardiac pacemaker due to bradycardia has been assigned the minimum 10 percent rating pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7018. However, as the record does not show that he experiences supraventricular arrhythmias, ventricular arrhythmias or an AV block related to his service-connected heart disability, a higher rating under Diagnostic Codes 7010, 7011, or 7015 respectively, is not warranted. 

The Board again acknowledges that Diagnostic Code 7018 instructs a minimum 10 percent rating to be evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 7010, 7011, or 7015. None of these conditions, specifically supraventricular arrhythmias, ventricular arrhythmias, and atrioventricular block, have been diagnosed during the appeal period, and the Board may not employ another DC to rate the Veteran's atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. See Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 337 (2015) (when a condition is specifically listed in the rating schedule, it may not be rated by analogy and should be rated under the diagnostic code that specifically pertains to it). 

Therefore, the Board finds that, while an initial 100 percent rating is warranted for the period prior to May 1, 2014, for implantation of cardiac pacemaker due to bradycardia, the assignment of an initial 10 percent rating subsequent to May 1, 2014, for such disability is proper and the appeal must otherwise be denied.

Lastly, the Board notes that for all other conditions listed under Diseases of the Heart, the General Rating Formula should be used. However, the Veteran has already been provided a 100 percent rating under the General Rating Formula for his service-connected ischemic heart disease. 

The Board concludes the evidence persuasively favors against the claim, it is not in approximate balance, and the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Accordingly, an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for atrial fibrillation with bradycardia status post implanted cardiac pacemaker for the period since May 1, 2014, is not warranted.

Surgical scar, pacemaker implantation

The February 2024 rating decision granted service connection for a surgical scar, pacemaker implantation at an initial noncompensable rating, effective February 28, 2014, under Diagnostic Code 7805.

In evaluating skin and scar residuals, the Board notes that during the appeal period, changes were made to certain Diagnostic Codes under 38 C.F.R. § 4.118. Effective August 13, 2018, VA amended its regulations governing skin disabilities. VA's intent is that the claims pending prior to the effective date will be considered under both old and new rating criteria, and whatever criteria is more favorable to the Veteran will be applied. For applications filed on or after the effective date, only the new criteria will be applied.  83 Fed. Reg. 32592 (July 13, 2018). As the Veteran filed his claim before the August 13, 2018, effective date, the Board will consider whether either the old or new rating criteria is more favorable to the Veteran. 

The pre-amended Diagnostic Code 7801 provided disability ratings for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are deep and nonlinear.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7801 (2021).  In contrast, the amended Diagnostic Code 7801 contemplates burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7801 (August 13, 2018). Both the old and new criteria provide that a 10 percent rating is awarded when the area of the scar(s) covers at least 6 square inches (39 square centimeters) but less than 12 square inches (77 square centimeters). A 20 percent rating is warranted when the area of the scar(s) covers at least 12 square inches (77 square centimeters) but less than 72 square inches (456 square centimeters). A 30 percent rating is warranted when the area of the scar(s) covers at least 72 square inches (456 square centimeters) but less than 144 square inches (929 square centimeters). A 40 percent rating is assigned when the area of the scar(s) covers at least 144 square inches (929 square centimeters) or greater. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic 7801. Note (1) to the pre-amended Diagnostic Code 7801 stated that a deep scar is one associated with underlying soft tissue damage.

Prior to August 13, 2018, Diagnostic Code 7802 provided rating criteria for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are superficial and nonlinear.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic 7802 (2022).  The amended version is for burn scar(s) or scar(s) due to other causes, not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying soft tissue damage.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7802 (August 13, 2018).  Both versions state that a 10 percent disability rating is warranted when the area of the scar covers 144 square inches (929 square centimeters) or greater. 

Under both the old and new rating criteria, Diagnostic Code 7804 provides disability ratings for scars that are unstable or painful.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for one or two scars that are unstable or painful.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for three or four scars that are unstable or painful. A 30 percent rating is warranted for five or more scars that are unstable or painful. Note (1) states that an unstable scar is one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar. Note (2) provides that if one or more scars are both unstable and painful, an additional 10 percent should be added to the evaluation based on the total number of unstable or painful scars. Note (3) states that scars evaluated under diagnostic codes 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7805 may also receive an evaluation under this diagnostic code, when applicable. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic 7804.

Under the old rating criteria, Diagnostic Code 7805 provided that other scars (including linear scars) and other effects of scars evaluated under Diagnostic Codes 7800, 7801, 7802, and 7804 require the evaluation of any disabling effect(s) not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-7804 under an appropriate Diagnostic Code.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7805 (2017).  The Board notes that this diagnostic code is largely unchanged under the new amendments apart from the replacement of the phrase "(including linear scars)" with "and other effects of scars evaluated under diagnostic codes 7800, 7801, 7802, or 7804." 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7805 (August 13, 2018).  

In every instance where the schedule does not provide a 0 percent rating for a diagnostic code, a 0 percent rating will be assigned when the requirements for a compensable rating are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

The Veteran underwent a VA examination in October 2023. The examiner noted that the Veteran did not have any scars of located on the head, neck or face. The surgical scar from the pacemaker implantation was not painful and/or unstable and there were no symptoms. The scar of the left upper chest was 7cm x 1cm. The Veteran's scar did not impact his ability to work.

Based on the evidence, the Board does not find that the Veteran is entitled to an initial compensable rating for surgical scar, pacemaker implantation.

As noted above, the surgical scar, pacemaker implantation disability is rated under Diagnostic Code 7805 at an initial noncompensable disability rating. Diagnostic Code 7805 provides that any disabling effects not considered in a rating provided under Diagnostic Codes 7800-7804 are to be considered under an appropriate diagnostic code. 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7805.

As the Veteran's scar is not on the face, head or neck, and are linear, Diagnostic Codes 7800-7802 do not apply in this case, and will not be discussed.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Codes 7800-7802.

The Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to a higher, 10 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 7805, because his scar does not have an area of 39 square inches or greater.  On the VA examination, the October 2023 examiner specifically noted that the total area of all the related scars was not greater than 39 square cm.

As a result, the Board finds that an initial compensable rating for surgical scar, pacemaker implantation under Diagnostic Code 7805 is not warranted. 

Earlier Effective Dates

Laws and Regulations

Except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an evaluation and award of pension, compensation or dependency, and indemnity compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be on the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C.§ 5110 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.400(b)(2). If a claim is reviewed at the request of the claimant more than one year after the effective date of a liberalizing law, benefits may be authorized for a period of one year prior to the date of receipt of such request. 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 (a)(2).

When an award is based on a claim to reopen a previously denied claim, the effective date will be the date of receipt of the new (i.e., reopened) claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later, unless new and material evidence was received within the relevant appeal period. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (q). If new and material evidence other than service department records is received within the appeal period or prior to appellate decision, the effective date will be as though the former decision had not been rendered.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that once a rating decision which establishes an effective date becomes final, such a decision can only be revised if it contains clear and unmistakable error. See Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296, 299-300 (2006). The Court has stressed that any other result would vitiate the rule of finality, thereby recognizing that freestanding claims for earlier effective dates are impermissible. Id. 

VA law and regulation provide that unless otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of increased evaluation shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of the application therefor.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Regulations also provide that the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o) (1).

The Board notes that the effective date of an award of increased compensation may, however, be established at the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if the application for an increased evaluation is received within one year from that date.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b) (2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o) (2).

For a claim for increased rating, if the increase is factually ascertainable within one year prior to the receipt of the claim, the rating will be effective as of the date of increase; however, if the increase occurred more than one year prior to receipt of the claim, the increase will be effective on the date of claim. Further, if the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date will be the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1), (2); VAOPGCPREC 12-98 (1998).

Thus, determining an appropriate effective date for an increased rating under the effective date regulations involves an analysis of the evidence to determine (1) when a claim for an increased rating was received and, if possible, (2) when the increase in disability actually occurred.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400(o) (2). 

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. The amendments implement the concept of an intent to file a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats. The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (now codified at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1 (p), 3.151, 3.155). The amendments apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

Under the former regulations prior to March 24, 2015, a specific claim in the form prescribed by VA must be filed in order for benefits to be paid or furnished to any individual under the laws administered by VA. 38 U.S.C. § 5101 (a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.151 (a). The term "claim" or "application" means a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1 (p). Any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by VA from a claimant may be considered an informal claim. Such informal claim must identify the benefit sought. Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the claimant for execution. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a). To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim. See Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992).

A pending claim is an application, formal or informal, which has not been finally adjudicated. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160 (c). The pending claims doctrine provides that a claim remains pending in the adjudication process if VA fails to act on it. Norris v. West, 12 Vet. App. 413, 422 (1999). Raising a pending claim theory in connection with a challenge to the effective-date decision is procedurally proper. Ingram v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 232, 249, 255 (2007).

In regard to the date of entitlement, the term "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statue or regulation. However, the Court has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought. This is determined on a "facts found" basis. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); see also McGrath v. Gober; 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). It is important to note that an effective date generally can be no earlier than the facts found. DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011). For instance, if a claimant filed a claim for benefits for a disability before he actually had the disability, the effective date for benefits can be no earlier than the date the disability first manifested. Ellington v. Peake, 541 F.3d 1364, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

Ischemic Heart Disease

A June 2011 rating decision denied entitlement to service connection for ischemic heart disease for retroactive benefits. 

The Veteran filed a claim to reopen that was received by VA on October 9, 2012. 

A September 2013 rating decision found that the Veteran's claim to reopen his service connection claim for ischemic heart disease was denied on the basis that the evidence submitted was not new and material. 

In November 2013, the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement under the legacy appeal system and a Statement of the Case (SOC) was issued in February 2017. 

The Veteran perfected this appeal and a Supplemental Statement of the Case (SSOC) was issued in November 2017. 

The Veteran then chose to participate in VA's test program RAMP, the Rapid Appeals Modernization Program as he selected the Higher-Level review lane when he submitted the RAMP election form in October 2018. 

A January 2019 RAMP decision again denied entitlement to service connection for ischemic heart disease. 

In January 2020 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of claim most recently addressed in the January 2019 rating decision.

An April 2020 rating decision confirmed and continued the denial of service connection for ischemic heart disease. 

In February 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR, and requested review of an April 2020 decision regarding denial of entitlement to service connection for ischemic heart disease.

A May 2021 rating decision continued the denial of service connection for ischemic heart disease. 

In April 2022 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of claim most recently addressed in the May 2021 rating decision.

An August 2022 rating decision found that the Veteran's claim for service connection claim for ischemic heart disease was denied on the basis that the evidence submitted was not new and relevant. 

A February 2024 rating decision granted service connection for ischemic heart disease at an initial 100 percent rating, effective November 5, 2013, which was the first date that VA treatment records showed unstable angina. The rating decision found that clear and unmistakable error (CUE) occurred in the January 2019 rating decision when failing to establish service connection for ischemic heart disease.

The record evidence shows that he has pursued a claim of service connection for ischemic heart disease continuously.

As reflected above, a request to reopen the claim of service connection for ischemic heart disease was received on October 9, 2012. 

Again, its February 2024 rating decision, the AOJ determined that the earliest medical evidence of ischemic heart disease is dated November 5, 2013, and granted service connection on that basis, assigning an effective date of November 5, 2013. 

As reflected above, the effective date for a grant of service connection following a final prior disallowance is the date of receipt of the application to reopen, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (q)(1)(ii).  

Notably, when service connection is granted under a liberalizing law or regulation, then 38 C.F.R. § 3.114 (a) provides that VA may assign an effective date 1 year earlier than the date of claim. Id. In this case, the Veteran's request to reopen the claim of service connection for ischemic heart disease was received on October 9, 2012. Because VA subsequently granted service connection for ischemic heart disease based on presumptive service connection due to in-service exposure to an herbicide agent, the earliest possible effective date for this claim is October 9, 2011. 

Accordingly, the earliest possible effective date would be the October 9, 2011, unless the record demonstrates a later date when entitlement to ischemic heart disease arose. 

In this instance, the record reflects that the Veteran's was first diagnosed with a heart disability on April 29, 2013, as an April 29, 2013, private treatment record noted that the Veteran had chest pain which were most likely related to coronary artery disease and angina. Ischemic heart disease is an enumerated condition under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (e) and the regulatory definition includes atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease which includes coronary artery disease and stable angina. 

Notably, there is no evidence prior to April 29, 2013, of a diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. Significantly, a May 2011 Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) specifically found that the Veteran did not have ischemic heart disease. 

Thus, the Board finds that the dates entitlement arose for the Veteran's ischemic heart disease is after the date he submitted his claim to reopen on October 9, 2012. As such, the later date, April 29, 2013, controls.

In summary, entitlement to an earlier effective date of April 29, 2013, but no earlier, is warranted for the Veteran's ischemic heart disease disability as the Veteran's ischemic heart disease was first diagnosed on April 29, 2013. Accordingly, this is the earliest effective date available for this diagnosis.

Atrial Fibrillation

The Veteran contends that an effective date earlier than February 28, 2014, is warranted for the grant of service connection for atrial fibrillation with bradycardia status post implanted cardiac pacemaker. Notably, the February 2024 rating decision assigned an effective date of February 28, 2014, based on the date of the Veteran's pacemaker implantation surgery. 

As noted above, the Veteran was granted service connection for service connection for atrial fibrillation with bradycardia status post implanted cardiac pacemaker under Diagnostic Code 7018. Additionally, the Veteran also has a separate 100 percent rating for ischemic heart disease under Diagnostic Code 7805.

Under Diagnostic Code 7018 for implantable cardiac pacemakers, a 100 percent evaluation is warranted for two months following hospital admission for implantation or re-implantation. Thereafter, the disability should be evaluated as supraventricular arrythmias (Diagnostic Code 7010), ventricular arrhythmias (Diagnostic Code 7011), or atrioventricular block (Diagnostic Code 7015) with a minimum 10 percent evaluation.

After review of the law and regulations as set forth above, the evidence of record shows that the Veteran's hospital admission for implantation of the cardiac pacemaker was February 28, 2014. 

Accordingly, he is not entitled to an effective date earlier than the date of the pacemaker implantation procedure per Diagnostic Code 7018. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7018. 

A review of the record does not reveal any evidence prior to February 28, 2014, which indicates that the Veteran had implantation of the cardiac pacemaker.

The pertinent legal authority governing effective dates is clear and specific, and the Board is bound by that authority. The Board finds that the most persuasive evidence is against the assignment of an effective date for the award of the grant of service connection foal fibrillation with bradycardia status post implanted cardiac pacemaker earlier than February 28, 2014. Thus, since the Board finds no legal basis for assignment of any earlier effective date, the claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

Surgical Scar

The record does not indicate that the Veteran filed an explicit claim for service connection for surgical scar. Instead, service connection was awarded in a February 2024 rating decision based on the findings of VA treatment records which noted that the date of surgery for a pacemaker implantation was February 28, 2014.

A review of the record does not reveal any evidence prior to February 28, 2014, which indicates that the Veteran had a surgical scar associated with his service-connected heart disability.

Pursuant to VA regulation, once VA receives a complete claim, VA will adjudicate as part of the claim entitlement to any ancillary benefits that arise as a result of the adjudication decision. The Veteran, may, but need not, assert entitlement to ancillary benefits at the time the complete claim is filed. VA will also consider all lay and medical evidence of record in order to adjudicate entitlement to benefits for the claimed condition as well as entitlement to any additional benefits for complications of the claimed condition. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d)(2).

The Veteran's claim to reopen his claim for service connection for a heart disability, was received on October 9, 2012. The Veteran was awarded service connection for surgical scar effective February 28, 2014, the date VA treatment records noted pacemaker implantation surgery. Given that no explicit service connection claim for surgical scar was filed, and the Veteran's entitlement to surgical scar arose out of his claim for a heart disability, the Board finds that February 28, 2014, is the earliest date entitlement arose for surgical scar.

The pertinent legal authority governing effective dates is clear and specific, and the Board is bound by that authority. The Board finds that the most persuasive evidence is against the assignment of an effective date for the award of the grant of service connection for surgical scar earlier than February 28, 2014. Thus, since the Board finds no legal basis for assignment of any earlier effective date, the claim must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990).

Diabetes Mellitus

The earliest document that can be construed as a claim for service connection for a diabetes mellitus disability is the formal application for benefits, VA Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits (VA Form 21-526) which is date-stamped as having been received by the RO on March 23, 2017. 

The June 2017 rating decision granted service connection for a diabetes mellitus disability at an initial 10 percent disability evaluation, effective March 23, 2017, which was the date that the claim was received.

Based on the evidence, the Board finds that an effective date earlier than March 23, 2017, for the service-connected diabetes mellitus disability is not warranted as the claims file does not reflect that any communication filed prior to that date could be construed as a formal or informal claim for this specific benefit.

As the Veteran's claim for service connection for a diabetes mellitus disability was not received within one year of his September 1970 separation from service, the effective possible effective date is the date of receipt of the Veteran's claim, March 23, 1017.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b) (2) (i).

Accordingly, the Board finds that there otherwise is no basis for the assignment of an effective date earlier than March 23, 2017, for the award of entitlement to service connection for a diabetes mellitus disability. 

Under these circumstances, the claim for an earlier effective date must be denied.  In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine. However, as the most persuasive evidence is against assignment of an effective date earlier than March 23, 2017, for the award of entitlement to service connection for a diabetes mellitus disability, that doctrine is not applicable.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53- 56 (1990).

Diabetic Neuropathy

In April 2022 the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of claim most recently addressed in a September 2013 rating decision.

In a November 2020 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper and lower extremities, effective March 29, 2019.

The Board parenthetically notes that the Veteran in his October 2024 Notice of Disagreement, indicated that he desired an increased rating for his service-connected diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper and lower extremities disabilities. However, the Board notes that the February 2024 appealed rating decision only addressed the effective dates of the grant of service connection for diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper and lower extremities rather than the disability ratings. 

In the case of supplemental claims received more than one year after an AOJ decision, the effective date of an award may be "[no] earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim." See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a)(3). There is no provision in either statute or VA regulations that allows for an earlier effective date for a previously denied claim unless a clear and unmistakable error (CUE) was committed in a prior decision, or unless the new and relevant evidence required to readjudicate the claim resulted from receipt of additional relevant service department records. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (i); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105, 3.156(c).

In the instant case, based on consideration of these regulations, the effective date has been appropriately assigned as the date the Veteran's supplemental claim was received on March 29, 2019. 

The Veteran's initial claim for service connection for a peripheral neuropathy disability was denied in a final unappealed September 2013 rating decision.

Although the Veteran was notified of the decision and his appellate rights, he did not enter a notice of disagreement with the September 2013 rating decision. No further communication regarding his claim for service connection for diabetic peripheral neuropathy was received until March 29, 2019, when VA received his supplemental claim. Therefore, the September 2013 rating decision is final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (c); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104, 19.52, 20.1103.

The Veteran filed his supplemental claim for service connection for peripheral neuropathy on March 29, 2019.

As noted above, in a November 2020 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper and lower extremities, effective March 29, 2019.

While sympathetic to the Veteran's belief that an earlier effective date is warranted, for the reasons outlined above, in this case the Board is precluded from assigning an effective date prior to March 29, 2019, for the grant of service connection for diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper and lower extremities, as the effective date for the award cannot be earlier than the date of receipt of the March 2019 supplemental claim. The Board may only award benefits as they have been established by law. Here, the law clearly dictates when the effective date of the award of service connection is established. Accordingly, the benefits sought on appeal must be denied.

As described in detail above, the most persuasive evidence is against the Veteran's claims for an earlier effective date.  The Veteran's claim for an effective date earlier than March 29, 2019, for the grant of service connection for diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the bilateral upper and lower extremities disabilities must be denied on that basis.  

DEA

For the purposes of educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, the child or surviving spouse of a Veteran will have basic eligibility if the following conditions are met: (1) The Veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the Veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the Veteran's death; or (4) the Veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807 (a), 21.3021.

Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), effective dates relating to awards under Chapters 30, 31, 32, and 35 of this title or Chapter 106 shall, to the extent feasible, correspond to effective dates relating to awards of disability compensation. 38 U.S.C. § 5113.

In this decision, the Board has effectively granted an effective date of April 29, 2013, for a total disability rating for ischemic heart disease. 

Given the Board's grant here of an effective date of April 29, 2013, for the 100 percent evaluation for ischemic heart disease, entitlement to DEA arose on April 29, 2013. Therefore, an effective date of April 29, 2013, for the award of DEA is granted.

TDIU 

Laws and Regulations

Total disability will be considered to exist where there is present any impairment of mind and body that is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.340 (2022). Total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities, provided that the Veteran meets the schedular requirements. If there is only one service-connected disability, this disability should be rated at 60 percent or more; if there are two or more disabilities, at least one should be rated at 40 percent or more with sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combination to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) (2022).

To meet the requirement of "one 60 percent disability" or "one 40 percent disability," the following will be considered as one disability: (1) disability of one or both lower extremities, including the bilateral factor, if applicable; (2) disabilities resulting from one common etiology; (3) disabilities affecting a single body system; (4) multiple injuries incurred in action; and (5) multiple disabilities incurred as a prisoner of war. Id.  Substantially gainful employment is defined as work which is more than marginal and which permits the individual to earn a living wage. Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356 (1991).

In determining whether unemployability exists, consideration may be given to the Veteran's level of education, special training, and previous work experience, but it may not be given to his or her age or to any impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19 (2022).

The Veteran contends that a TDIU is warranted from at least March 2017 based solely on his service-connected PTSD preventing him from engaging in substantial gainful employment. 

However, the Board notes that the Veteran is now in receipt of a total 100 percent disability rating, effective April 29, 2013, for ischemic heart and SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s).

Under Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008), a 100 percent disability rating does not necessarily render a TDIU claim moot where a TDIU award premised on a single disability could potentially affect eligibility for SMC housebound, which requires one disability at 100 percent and another disability at 60 percent. See Bradley, 22 Vet. App. 280; Buie v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 242 (2010).

Here, however, there is no possible benefit that a TDIU grant would provide for the period since April 29, 2013, as he is already in receipt of a 100 percent disability rating for one disability, and the TDIU grant would not otherwise qualify him for SMC benefits that he is not already receiving. Under these circumstances, the Board finds this period "moot" for purposes of TDIU consideration. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Board finds that more development is necessary prior to final adjudication of the claims remaining on appeal.

The Veteran contends that he has a current Parkinson's disease disability that was incurred in service, to include as due to exposure to herbicide agents while he served in Vietnam. Notably, VA has conceded herbicide exposure due to his service in Vietnam. 

The February 2024 rating decision denied the Veteran's claim for entitlement to service connection for a Parkinson's disease disability on the basis that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.

However, evidence of a current Parkinson's disease disability possibly exists as VA treatment notes, including a February 2024 VA treatment report, reflect that they "needed to keep an eye out for possible emerging Parkinson's."

Notably, while the Veteran has presumed exposure to herbicide agents during his service, the Veteran has not yet been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

The Board also notes that the Veteran has yet to undergo a VA examination in conjunction with his claimed Parkinson's disease disability.

An examination or opinion is necessary to make a decision on a claim if the evidence of record contains competent evidence that the claimant has a current disability and indicates that the disability or symptoms may be associated with the claimant's active military history but does not contain sufficient medical evidence to make a decision on the claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A (d) (2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c) (4).

As a result, the Board finds that a VA medical opinion is required to address whether the Veteran has a current Parkinson's disease disability that is related to his active-duty service to include as secondary to in-service herbicide exposure.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c) (4).

Additionally, the Board notes that further development and adjudication of the Veteran's claim for service connection may provide evidence in support of his claims of entitlement to earlier effective dates prior to February 28, 2014, to April 30, 2014, and prior to April 12, 2017, for entitlement to SMC at the housebound rate and entitlement to an effective date prior to April 29, 2013, for entitlement to eligibility to DEA under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35. See Henderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 11 (1998), citing Harris v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 180 (1991), for the proposition that where a decision on one issue would have a "significant impact" upon another, and that impact in turn could render any review of the decision on the other claim meaningless and a waste of appellate resources, the claims are inextricably intertwined. The Board has therefore concluded that it would be inappropriate at this juncture to enter a final determination on these issues. 

The Board noted that AMA provides that remands are warranted based on VA's duty to assist prior to the AOJ decision. Pub. L. No. 115-55, § 2(d)(2). The AMA structure allows remand only where VA has committed error in the duty-to-assist (DTA) prior to the decision on appeal. After a thorough review of the record, the Board finds the arguments of the Veteran's representative to be compelling. In requesting additional development on remand in this case, the Board notes that the basis for this remand arises from deficiencies in the record existing prior to the appealed AMA decision. Notably, prior to the February 2024 rating decision, there was evidence of a possible in-service incurrence of a Parkinson's disease disability as secondary to the Veteran's conceded herbicide exposure. As noted above, despite the possible relation between this disability and conceded in-service herbicide exposure, the Veteran was not provided with a VA examination to the appealed AMA decision.

Thus, the Board finds that a remand is necessary in order to provide the Veteran with a VA examination and opinions with respect to this claimed condition as there exists pre-decisional duties to assist error and the claim must be remanded for an examination. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the nature and etiology of the Veteran's claimed Parkinson's disease disability. 

Based on a review of the record, the examiner should provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran has a current Parkinson's disease disability that initially manifested in or was otherwise etiologically related to the Veteran's service to include as due to the Veteran's conceded herbicide exposure.
