ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's tinnitus is at least as likely as not related to noise exposure in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Marine Corps from October 2003 to October 2007.

As an initial matter, in Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held the Board should not adjudicate an appeal until the time for the appellant to switch Board dockets has ended. This period ends either one year from the date the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) mailed notice of the decision on appeal, or 60 days from the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, whichever date is later. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2). Here, the Board may proceed with adjudication because this decision represents a full grant of the benefit sought on appeal, so the Board finds there is no prejudice to the Veteran.

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F. 3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or if they manifested to a compensable degree within one year following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. § 1112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. For the showing of "chronic" disease in service, there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity, and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time. With chronic disease shown in service or within the presumptive period, subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date, however remote, are service connected, unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(b). 

In making all determinations, the Board must fully consider the lay assertions of record. A layperson is competent to report on the onset and continuity of his current symptomatology. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a Veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge). Likewise, the Board must assess the credibility and weight of all the evidence, including the medical evidence, to determine its probative value, accounting for evidence, which it finds to be more persuasive or unpersuasive, and providing reasons for rejecting any evidence favorable to the claimant. See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49 (1990). Equal weight is not afforded to each piece of evidence contained in the record; not every item of evidence has the same probative value.

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving the issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b).

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

The Veteran is seeking service connection for tinnitus as a result of noise exposure in service. See May 2024 VA Form 21-526EZ.

The Board acknowledges the favorable findings in the June 2024 rating decision that the Veteran was exposed to acoustic trauma during service and the Veteran has a diagnosis of tinnitus. The remaining question before the Board is whether there is a causal relationship between the Veteran's tinnitus and in-service noise exposure. 

In the May 2024 Application for Disability Compensation, the Veteran reported his tinnitus began during a machine gun shoot while deployed during service. He stated the event caused him to experience ringing in his ears.

During the June 2024 VA examination, the Veteran reported that his current tinnitus began during service. He also reported that it continues every few days lasting a couple of minutes at a time.

Tinnitus may be diagnosed by its unique and readily identifiable features, and the presence of the disorder is not a determination that is medical in nature; it is capable of lay observation. Charles v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 370 (2002). A layperson also is competent to testify as to the onset and continuity of symptomatology. Heuer v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 379, 384 (1995); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 403 (1995). 

Service treatment records are silent for complaints of, treatment for, or diagnoses of tinnitus while the Veteran was in active service. Nevertheless, the Veteran reported that he first experienced tinnitus during active-duty service and that his symptoms have continued since service.

The Board acknowledges that the June 2024 VA examiner provided a medical opinion concluding it is less likely than not that the Veteran's tinnitus is related to service and provided a rationale for that opinion. However, because the Veteran is competent to observe the onset of tinnitus during service, and because there is no evidence of record calling into question his credibility on this point, the Board does not find the VA opinion entitled to greater weight than the lay evidence that tinnitus is related to service.

In summary, the AOJ, in favorable findings, acknowledged the in-service acoustic trauma and the current presence of tinnitus. The Veteran competently and credibly reported that his tinnitus onset in service and has had continuation of symptomology.

Accordingly, there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule applies, and entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).
