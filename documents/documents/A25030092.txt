FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The weight of the evidence of record is persuasively against a finding of a currently diagnosed LLE disorder.

2. A substantive appeal was not received from the Veteran after issuance of a Statement of the Case (SOC) for her legacy appeal of the issue of service connection for right hip disability. Her supplemental claim was received on October 30, 2020. An Intent to File was received on September 24, 2020

3. VA received an Intent to File on September 2, 2020. A formal claim of service connection for an acquired mental disorder was received the same month.

4. For the period prior to May 18, 2021, the Veteran's right hip disability manifested with noncompensable LOM on extension and flexion, and loss of adduction that prevented her from crossing her legs and limitation on extension to 5 degrees.

5. For the period May 18, 2021, to March 2, 2022, the right hip manifested with limitation on extension to 5 degrees. From that March 3, 2022, forward, limitation on extension and flexion was noncompensable but painful.

6. The weight of the evidence of record is persuasively against a finding of a currently diagnosed right or left ankle disorder.

7. The weight of the evidence of record is persuasively against a finding that a left foot condition, including plantar fasciitis, had onset in active service or is otherwise causally connected to active service.

8. The weight of the evidence of record is persuasively against a finding of a currently diagnosed right foot disorder.

9. The weight of the evidence of record shows that the Veteran's neurological disorder, RLE, more nearly approximated moderate symptomatology throughout the initial rating period on appeal.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

As a member of a State Air National Guard (ANG), the Veteran had active service from January 2012 to February 2012.

The Veteran, through her attorney, appealed a June 2023 rating decision on Higher-Level Review (HLR) via the Direct Review Lane, and the appeal was duly docketed at the Board. See June 2023 Rating Decision Narrative; June 2024 VA Form 10182; July 2024 BVA Docketing Letter.

Evidentiary Record

The Board decision below is based on the evidence of record as of the date the May 2022 rating decision was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. The Board has not considered any evidence other than that noted.

If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision below. 38 C.F.R. § 20.300. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claim file that the Board could not consider, he may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision.

Service Connection

Applicable Legal Requirements

Generally, to establish a right to compensation for a present disability, a veteran must show: (1) a present disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service, the so-called "nexus" requirement. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). In the absence of a currently diagnosed disorder, symptoms may also reach the level of a disability if they caused impairment of earning capacity. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

In relevant part, 38 U.S.C. § 1154 (a) requires that VA give "due consideration" to "all pertinent medical and lay evidence" in evaluating a claim for disability or death benefits. Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009). A layperson is competent to report on the onset of disability and, when applicable, continuity of his or her current symptomatology. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994) (a veteran is competent to report on that of which he or she has personal knowledge). Lay evidence can also be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis if (1) the layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. Mattox v. McDonough, 56 F.4th 1369, 1378-1379 (2023); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

1. Entitlement to service connection for neurological disorder, LLE, including as due to service connected right hip arthroscopy residuals, is denied.

A VA Peripheral Nerves DBQ (June 2021 C&P Exam, 9th Entry) reflects that the examiner diagnosed lumbar sciatica of each lower extremity, and that it manifested with paresthesias and numbness and decreased sensation if the lower leg and foot/toe. Id. P. 2, 3, 4. An April 2022 DBQ (April 2022 C&P Exam, 1st Entry), however, reflects that the examiner noted the Veteran's reported subjective symptoms, but the clinical examination did not reveal objective findings to confirm her subjective complaints and support a diagnosis. Id. P. 14. A Back DBQ (April 2022 C&P Exam, 3rd Entry) reflects that the examiner diagnosed a lumbosacral strain, which the examiner opined does not cause radiculopathy. A June 2010 lumbar MRI showed disc bulges but without nerve encroachment. A May 2022 DBQ (May 2022 C&P Exam, 3rd Entry) reflects that the examiner noted that her examination of the Veteran did not elicit findings that confirmed an LLE neurological disorder. The examiner noted the Veteran's lay reports and the fact that the Veteran is undergoing regular nerve block injections for her right hip disability. The examiner noted that nerve dermatomes do not cross the midline and as such, a left radiculopathy, if it existed could not be due to a right hip issue. Hence, she opined that there was no diagnosable LLE neurological disorder. Id. P. 2. The Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the claim, as the medical examiner provided a plausible explanation for her opinion that the Veteran's symptoms were subjective only, as the objective findings on clinical examination did not confirm a diagnosis.

2. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral ankle condition is denied.

The service records related to the Veteran's right hip claim do not contain any notations of complaints related to her ankles. The same is true of the records of her non-VA orthopedist who treated her for her chronic right hip complaints. See May 2016 Medical Treatment-Non-Government Facility; April 2022 Non-Government Facility, 1st Entry.

The first requirement for service connection is a currently diagnosed injury or disease. The requirement that a current disability be present is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of the claim, even though the disability resolves prior to the Secretary's adjudication of the claim. See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007). In this case, there is no evidence of a currently diagnosed disorder of either ankle. Hence, the Board finds that the evidence is persuasively against the claim, and that the Board is constrained to deny it. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

3. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral foot condition is denied.

As concerns the right foot, there is no evidence of a currently diagnosed disorder. As concerns the left foot, an April 2022 non-VA record notes that the Veteran complained of left heel and foot pain, that she had a history of a fall in February 2022, and that an MRI examination revealed left plantar fasciitis. See April 2022 Non-Government Facility, P. 11, 12, 19, 21. There is no indication or notation that the left plantar fasciitis had onset in active service, or that it is causally connected to active service, as the disorder manifested some 10 years after the Veteran's discharge from active service. Hence, the Board finds no basis for service connection for the right foot, as there is no currently diagnosed disorder; and there is no indication that the left plantar fasciitis had onset in active service. Thus, the Board is constrained to deny the claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Earlier Effective Date

Applicable General Requirements

For claims received after October 1984, date of receipt of claim, except as otherwise provided. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(ii)(A). If a claim for VA compensation is not received within one year of separation from active service, the effective date is the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(ii)(B)(2)(ii).

Entitlement to an earlier effective date earlier than September 2, 2020, for service connection for acquired mental disorder, including adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, is denied.

The Veteran's NOD is not clear as to whether the Veteran appealed the effective date on which service connection was granted and the effective date for the assigned initial evaluations or only the latter. Hence, the Board addresses both bases.

VA received the Veteran's Intent to file on September 2, 2020, and her formal claim for service connection on September 17, 2020. See September 2020 Intent to File; September 2020 VA 21-526EZ. In the rating decision that granted service connection, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) assigned an effective date of September 2, 2020, the date of receipt of the Veteran's Intent to File. That is the earliest effective date allowable by applicable law. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155(b), 3.400. Hence, the Board must deny the appeal for an earlier effective date for service connection. The Board addresses the effective date for the initial evaluations in the remand part of this decision.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 24, 2020, for service connection for post-arthroscopic residuals, right hip, is denied.

Applicable Legal Requirements

Under the regulations in effect in 2017, an appeal consisted of a timely filed NOD and receipt of a timely Substantive Appeal after issuance of an SOC. 38 C.F.R. § 20.200 (2017). A claimant had one year from the date of notice of a decision, or 60 days after an SOC was issued, whichever was the later, to perfect an appeal by filing a Substantive Appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302 (2017).

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), for supplemental claims received more than one year after the date on which the AOJ issues notice of a decision, or the Board of Veterans' Appeals issued notice of a decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(2). The regulation specifically excludes supplemental claims from the Intent to File provision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501(d).

Discussion

VA received the Veteran's initial claim for service connection in 2016. See April 2016 VA 21-526EZ. In an October 2016 rating decision, the AOJ denied the claim, and the Veteran appealed. See October 2016 Rating Decision Narrative; January 2017 NOD. In response to the Veteran's NOD, the AOJ issued the Veteran an SOC in February 2017. See February 2017 SOC. The Veteran did not submit a Substantive Appeal in response to the SOC. Hence, the October 2016 rating decision became final.

On her September 2020 formal claim, the Veteran included her right hip claim. The AOJ informed her that she had to use the proper Form to reopen the claim. See October 2020 Correspondence. VA received her supplemental claim on the proper Form on October 30, 2020. See October 2020 VA 21-0995. This fact notwithstanding, the AOJ afforded the Veteran the benefit of the Intent to File provision and assigned an effective date of the date of September 24, 2020, the date of receipt of her Intent to File. As such, the Veteran is in receipt of the earliest effective date allowed and there no factual basis for an earlier effective date.

Higher Initial Ratings

General Legal Requirements

Disability ratings are intended to compensate for impairment in earning capacity due to a service-connected disorder. 38 U.S.C. § 1155. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.27. It is necessary to rate the disability from the point of view of the Veteran working or seeking work, see 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, and to resolve any reasonable doubt regarding the extent of the disability in the Veteran's favor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Evaluations are based on functional impairments which impact a veteran's ability to pursue gainful employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.10. Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating, unless the rating criteria are progressive. See Camacho v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 360, 367-68 (2007). Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

The Veteran is entitled to a staged rating for any part of the rating period on appeal where either disability manifested with greater severity. See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).

Musculoskeletal Provisions

Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or inflammation in parts of the system, to perform normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination and endurance. The functional loss may be due to absence of part or all of the necessary bones, joints and muscles, or associated structures, or to deformity, adhesions, defective innervation, or other pathology, or may be due to pain, supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by visible behavior of the claimant undertaking the motion. Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part which becomes painful on use must be regarded as disabled. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 205-08 (1995); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45.

When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). Nonetheless, even when the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a (musculoskeletal system) or § 4.73 (muscle injury); a separate or higher rating under § 4.40 or 4.45 itself is not appropriate. See Thompson v. McDonald, 815 F.3d 781, 785 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[I]t is clear that the guidance of § 4.40 is intended to be used in understanding the nature of the veteran's disability, after which a rating is determined based on the § 4.71a [or 4.73] criteria."). However, a veteran may be entitled to a higher disability evaluation than that supported by mechanical application of the rating schedule where there is evidence that his or her disability causes "additional functional loss i.e., 'the inability...to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination[,] and endurance' including as due to pain and/or other factors" or "reduction of a joint's normal excursion of movement in different planes, including changes in the joint's range of movement, strength, fatigability, or coordination." Lyles v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 107, 117-18 (2017) (quoting 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 and citing 38 C.F.R. § 4.45); Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 36-37 (2011); DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 205-07 (1995).

The intent of the rating schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or periarticular pathology as productive of disability. It is the intention to recognize actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59. In Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158 (2016), the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) held that the final sentence of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 requires that the examiner record the results of ROM testing "for pain on both active (AROM) and passive motion (PROM) [and] in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing and, if possible, with ROM measurements of the opposite undamaged joint." The spine has no opposite joint. In Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26 (2017), the CAVC held that VA examiners must obtain information about the severity, frequency, duration, precipitating and alleviating factors, and extent of functional impairment of flares from the veterans themselves, when a flare-up is not observable at the time of examination.

The rating criteria for the musculoskeletal system were changed, effective February 7, 2019. The Veteran is entitled to the version most favorable to her claim, but the amended criteria may not be applied to a period prior to their effective date. Kuzma v. Principi, 341 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see also Karnas v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 308 (1991). The Board notes that the amendments do not impact the criteria applicable to the Veteran's claim.

?

Entitlement to an initial evaluation higher than 10 percent for post-arthroscopic residuals, right hip, loss of adduction that prevents crossing of legs, is denied.

Hip disability based on range of motion (ROM) is determined by motion on flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate II. The AOJ evaluated this facet of the Veteran's disability as impairment of the thigh under DC 5253. Under these provisions, limitation of abduction of, motion lost beyond 10 degrees warrants a 20 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. DC 5253. Limitation of adduction of, cannot cross legs, or limitation of rotation of, cannot toe-out more than 15 degrees, affected leg, warrants a 10 percent rating. Id.

Discussion

The Veteran's non-VA treatment records primarily address treatment of her chronic pain, and references to the ROM of her hip are in general terms. No specific measurements are noted. A VA DBQ (June 2021 C&P Exam, 7th Entry) reflects that the Veteran reported daily flare-ups of severe pain that are precipitated by any activity, and that they could last from hours to days. Id. P. 2. She described her functional loss as arthritis and loss of muscle tone. Id. P. 3. Testing on active ROM (AROM) revealed pain in all planes. The examiner noted that findings on PROM were the same as for AROM. Motion on abduction was to 20 degrees, and on adduction to 15 degrees. The examiner noted that a limitation in adduction prevented the Veteran from crossing her legs. Id. P. 3, 4.

Upon receipt of the DBQ, the AOJ assigned an initial 10 percent rating for the loss of adduction. See May 2022 Rating Decision Narrative, P. 3, 4. This is the sole rating allowable for loss of adduction. Hence, the Board finds that the evidence is against a higher rating. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.71a, DC 5253. 

?

Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for post-arthroscopic residuals, right hip, limitation of extension and flexion for the period prior to May 18, 2021, is denied. Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation not to exceed 10 percent, limitation of extension, for the period May 18, 2021, to March 2, 2022, is granted. Entitlement to a compensable rating from that date forward for right hip, limitation of extension, is denied.

Normal ROM of the hip is 0 to 125 degrees on flexion. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Plate II. Plate II does not include an image of motion on extension, but the Hip and Thigh DBQ notes that normal motion on extension is to 30 degrees.

Hip flexion and extension are evaluated under DC 5252. Under these provisions, flexion limited to 10 degrees warrants a 40 percent rating; flexion limited to 20 degrees warrants a 30 percent rating; flexion limited to 30 degrees warrants a 20 percent rating; and flexion limited to 45 degrees warrants a 10 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5252.

Thigh extension limited to 5 degrees warrants a 10 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5251.

Discussion

The earlier discussion of the Veteran's lay reports and the examination findings as concerns pain are incorporated here by reference. The June 2021 DBQ reflects that AROM on flexion was to 60 degrees, and extension was to 10 degrees, and that repetitive use testing did not reveal any additional loss of ROM. See June 2021 C&P Exam, 7th Entry, P. 3, 5. There was no evidence of tenderness or crepitus. Id. P. 5. Based on the Veteran's records, her lay statements, and the examination findings, the examiner estimated that the Veteran would lose an additional 5 degrees in each plane of motion due to functional loss on repeat use over time and due to her reported flareups. Id. P. 6; see also Sharp, 29 Vet. App. 26. The net findings for motion on flexion were still greater than 0 to 45 degrees. The net findings for the Veteran's motion on extension, however, were extension limited to 5 degrees. Hence, contrary to the determination of the AOJ, the Veteran's right hip manifested with compensable LOM on extension.

The Board finds that the earliest date on which it is factually ascertainable that limitation on extension to 5 degrees is May 18, 2021, the date of the 2021 examination. Hence, the Board allows a 10 percent rating as of that date. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.71a, DC 5251.

A March 2022 DBQ (May 2022 C&P Exam) reflects that the Veteran reported continued chronic pain, and that she continued to receive cortisone injections. She reported daily flare-ups that consisted of throbbing spasms and pain that lasted for 2 to 4 hours, and that they were precipitated by sitting on hard surfaces and physical activity. Id. P. 3. She described her functional loss as difficulty walking up and down stairs and walking and sitting. Id. AROM findings on flexion was to 60 degrees, and to extension, 20 degrees. The examiner noted that PROM findings were the same as AROM. Id. P. 5, 6. There was evidence of tenderness but not of crepitus. Id. The examiner noted that repetitive use testing and the estimated loss due to repeat use over time and flare-ups, resulted in an additional loss of 10 degrees in all planes. Id. P. 9, 10, 12.

The Board notes that the examination findings reflect that the Veteran's net motion on extension was greater than 5 degrees. Hence, her LOM on extension no longer manifested at a compensable rate as of the date of the examination, March 3, 2022. Based on the evidence set forth above, the Board finds that the evidence of record persuasively supports a stage rating for LOM on extension of 0 percent for the period prior to May 18, 2021; 10 percent for the period May 18, 2021, to March 3, 2022; and 0 percent from March 3, 2022, forward. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 4.1, 4.40, 4.45, 4.71a, DC 5251. 

Entitlement to an initial evaluation not to exceed 10 percent for post-arthroscopic residuals, right hip, for painful noncompensable LOM on flexion and extension, is granted, effective, March 3, 2022.

The rating criteria for musculoskeletal disabilities provide for the minimum compensable rating where the LOM is noncompensable, but motion is painful through the entire range for the affected joint. 38 C.F.R. § 4.59; see also Mitchell, 25 Vet. App. 32. Any compensable LOM subsumes a rating for painful noncompensable LOM. Hence, the compensable rating for LOM on extension discussed above subsumed a rating under this provision. As of the March 2022 examination, however, the Veteran's LOM on extension and flexion was noncompensable, and the examination report reflects that the Veteran's motion was painful on extension and flexion. Hence, the Veteran met the criteria for the minimum compensable rating, which is 10 percent. See id. It is not applicable to each plane of motion. Only one compensable rating is allowable under this provision. Hence, the Board allows a 10 percent rating for painful motion on extension and flexion from March 3, 2022, forward. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.59, 4.71a, DCs 5251, 5252.

As concerns the entire initial rating period on appeal, the Board notes that the DBQs reflect that there were no findings of flail joint or femur impairment. Hence, there is no factual basis for higher ratings under DC 5254 or 5255.

Entitlement to an initial evaluation not to exceed 20 percent for RLE neurological symptomatology is granted.

Rating Criteria

The rating schedule as to diseases of the peripheral nerves indicates that when the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating should be for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves. In Miller v. Shulkin, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that "[a]lthough the note preceding § 4.124a directs the claims adjudicator to award no more than a 20 percent disability rating for incomplete paralysis of a peripheral nerve where the condition is productive of wholly sensory manifestations, it does not logically follow that any claimant who also exhibits non-sensory manifestations must necessarily be rated at a higher level." 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe," as used in the various diagnostic codes, are not defined in the rating schedule. The use of these terms by VA examiners and others, although an element of evidence to be considered by the Board, is not dispositive of an issue. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.2, 4.6. Rather than applying a mechanical formula, the Board must evaluate all of the evidence to the end that its decisions are "equitable and just." 38 C.F.R. § 4.6.

VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1) provides benchmarks for mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe peripheral nerve conditions. Although the Board is not bound by the M21-1, the standards provided in the M21-1 are "relevant guidance promulgated for the purpose of facilitating the efficient and proper resolution of claims," which the Board must consider and address as part of its duty to provide a reasoned explanation for its decision. Healey v. McDonough, 33 Vet. App. 312 (2021); Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257 (2018).

The Board finds these definitions to be instructive. Per the M21-1, mild is assigned for a disability limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a small area. A very minimal reflex or motor abnormality potentially could also be consistent with mild incomplete paralysis.

Moderate is described as the maximum evaluation reserved for the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment, in which symptoms will likely be described by the claimants and graded as significantly disabling, and in which a larger area in the nerve distribution may be affected. Other symptom combinations that may fall into the moderate category include the following: combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate. M21-1, V.iii.12.A.2.c.

To be described as "severe," it would be expected that there is motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability. Trophic changes may be seen in severe longstanding neuropathy, and marked muscular atrophy is expected in cases involving the sciatic nerve. Id.  

Discussion

A VA Peripheral Nerves DBQ (June 2021 C&P Exam, 9th Entry) reflects that a VA examiner diagnosed bilateral sciatica. Id. P. 2. The examiner noted the Veteran to complain of tingling down the back of both legs. She did not report any neurological pain. Id. The examiner noted that RLE strength was normal 5/5 without any evidence of muscle atrophy, as were reflexes. Id. P. 3. Sensation also was normal, except that the examiner noted it to be decreased at the lower leg/ankle and foot/toe. Id. P. 4. There was no evidence of trophic changes, and the examiner opined that the Veteran's gait was normal. Id. The examiner opined that the only nerve affected was the sciatic nerve, and that the severity was mild. Id. P. 6. The Veteran denied the use of any assistive device, and the examiner opined that she had not lost the use of the RLE. The examiner also noted that no diagnostic test had been performed. Id. P. 8, 9.

A Back DBQ (April 2022 C&P Exam, 2nd Entry) reflects that the examiner diagnosed a lumbosacral strain. The neurological part of the examination reflects that the Veteran's LE strength was normal 5/5 without evidence of muscle atrophy, and that reflexes and sensation were normal. Id. P. 11. SLR was negative bilaterally. Id. P. 12. The examiner noted the Veteran to report mild intermittent pain, paresthesias, and numbness of the RLE. The examiner opined that the roots of the sciatic nerve were involved, and that the Veteran did not manifest with intervertebral disc syndrome. The examiner noted a July 2010 lumbar MRI examination showed disc bulges at L4-5 and L5-S1. Id. P. 18.

The Peripheral Nerves DBQ (April 2022 C&P Exam, 1st Entry) reflects that the examiner noted the Veteran to report that the burning sensation of her LE had increased in severity, and that she could not tolerate the medication prescribed for relief. Id. P. 2. The examiner noted the Veteran to report mild intermittent pain, paresthesias, and numbness. As was the case with the back examination, the examiner noted the Veteran's RLE strength was normal 5/5 without evidence of muscle atrophy, and that her reflexes and sensation to light touch also were normal. Id. P. 4, 5. There was no evidence of trophic changes, and the examiner opined that the Veteran's gait was normal. Id. This examiner opined that the Veteran's symptoms were wholly subjective, as the examination revealed all nerves were normal as concerned radiculopathy. Id. P. 15.

A May 2022 DBQ (May 2022 C&P Exam, 3rd Entry) reflects that the medical examiner noted the diagnosis of lumbosacral strain, and she noted that strains do not cause radiculopathy. Hence, she opined that the Veteran's symptoms were due to neuralgia or neuropathy, not radiculopathy, and that the affected nerve was the femoral nerve. Id. P. 2.

The AOJ evaluated the RLE under the criteria for the femoral nerve under DC 8526. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a. Under DC 8526, complete paralysis of the femoral nerve, which entails paralysis of the quadriceps extensor muscles, warrants a 40 percent rating. Severe incomplete paralysis warrants a 30 percent rating; moderate incomplete paralysis, a 20 percent rating; and mild incomplete paralysis, a 10 percent rating. Id.

The Board finds that the weight of the evidence of record shows that the Veteran's RLE neurological symptoms are wholly sensory, as indicated by the consistent findings of normal strength and sensation. Sensory impairment, especially when subjective, tends towards a finding of mild severity. Nonetheless, the Board must factor in the affect of the Veteran's nerve block injections. See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012); see also Ingram v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 327 (__ Vet. App. ___, Mar. 12, 2025). The May 2022 DBQ reflects that the examiner noted that the Veteran's nerve block injections had improved her symptoms. The peripheral nerves rating criteria do not include or allow the ameliorating affects of medication. Hence, to allow the Veteran the full benefit of the rating criteria, the Board finds that moderate severity and a 20 percent rating is more nearly approximated. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1, 4.124a, DC 8526. The Board finds further that the rating is effective for the entire initial rating period on appeal, as the Veteran has been undergoing the injections for the entire period.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to an initial evaluation higher than 50 percent for major depressive disorder with generalized anxiety disorder (previously rated as adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood) for the period prior to March 4, 2022, is remanded.

The Veteran's attorney asserts that her non-VA treatment support a finding that the Veteran's impairment has been total for the entire initial rating period. The Board notes, however, that those records indicate the Veteran manifested with PTSD symptoms due to childhood sexual abuse. The Board is aware that unless distinguishable, all symptoms are deemed to be due to the service-connected pathology. Mitleider v. Brown, 11 Vet. App. 181 (1998). The VA DBQs, however, do not address those records and is, thus, inadequate. The AOJs reliance on this inadequate examination and opinion is pre-decisional duty to assist error. Hence, medical input is indicated to determine what impact, if any, the diagnosed PTSD had on the Veteran's mental health disability picture.

2. Entitlement to service connection for low back disorder, including as due to service connected right hip disability, is remanded.

A medical examiner opined that the Veteran's diagnosed lumbosacral strain is not due to her right hip disability, and she noted medical studies to support her opinion. She did not, however, address whether the right hip disability worsens the diagnosed low back disorder and is, thus, the examination/opinion is inadequate. The AOJs reliance on this inadequate examination and opinion is pre-decisional duty to assist error. Hence, a remand is required to address that question. See El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140-41 (2013); see also Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2023).

3. Entitlement to service connection for left hip sprain, including as due to service connected right hip disability, is remanded.

The Board finds that the issue of whether the left hip sprain is due to or worsened by the service-connected right hip disability is raised. The medical examiner did not address this facet of the claim and is, thus, the examination/opinion is inadequate. The AOJs reliance on this inadequate examination and opinion is pre-decisional duty to assist error. Hence, a remand is required.

4. Entitlement to a TDIU for the period prior to March 4, 2022, is remanded.

This issue is intertwined with the others for the earlier part of the initial rating period.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Send the claim file to an appropriate mental health clinician. Ask the clinician to review the claim file and then opine on the following: For the period prior to March 4, 2022, is it approximately at least as likely as not that the Veteran's symptoms of PTSD due to childhood sexual abuse can be distinguished from those related to her general adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. If so, please identify them and opine on their severity. If the answer is no, please provider an explanation as to why not.

2. Send the claim file to an appropriate clinician. The necessity for an in-person examination will be at the discretion of the clinician. Ask the clinician to review the claim file and then provide an addendum report wherein the clinician opines whether it is approximately at least as likely as not that the Veteran's service-connected right hip disability is a but-for cause of the Veteran's diagnosed lumbosacral strain to include aggravation or a worsening of functionality. Inform the clinician further that a full explanation of any opinion rendered must be provided. Please avoid conclusory statements that are not supported by specifics.

?

3. Ask the clinician to review the claim file and then provide an addendum opinion as concerns the Veteran's diagnosed left hip strain. Apply the same standards as provided for the lumbosacral strain above.

4. After the above is complete, readjudicate the claims as appropriate, to include the inferred TDIU issue for the period indicated.
