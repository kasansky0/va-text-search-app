ORDER

Entitlement to a compensable rating for service-connected hypertension is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

During the appeal period, the Veteran's hypertension did not manifest in diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more.  Also, the Veteran did not both have a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more and require continuous medication for control.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a compensable rating for service-connected hypertension have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.31, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from June 1994 to October 1994 and from June 2004 to December 2005, with additional periods of service in the National Guard.

In a January 2022 agency of jurisdiction (AOJ) rating decision, entitlement to a compensable rating was denied for service-connected hypertension. The Veteran filed for higher-level review and in a March 2023 rating decision, the denial was confirmed. In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2022 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to a compensable rating for service-connected hypertension.

The Veteran contends he is entitled to a compensable rating for his service-connected hypertension. See January 2022 Supplemental claim. Specifically, the Veteran, through his representative, contends that the January 2019 VA examination is inadequate because it did not adequately explain how it found the Veteran did not have a history of diastolic pressure predominantly of 100 or more. Id. In support of the contention, the Veteran's representative cites to two August 2005 blood pressure readings of 156 systolic, 102 diastolic and 138 systolic, 95 diastolic. 

Hypertension is rated pursuant to 38?C.F.R. §?4.104, Diagnostic Code (DC) 7101, for hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension).  Under DC 7101, a 10 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or; systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or; it is the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.

In rating hypertension under DC 7101, the Board may consider blood pressure readings taken while a veteran is using medication.  McCarroll v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 267, 271 (2016) (holding that DC 7101 contemplates the effects of medication and therefore Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012), does not apply.

The term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria.  Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common."  See, e.g., "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.

For the reasons that follow, the Veteran's hypertension has not more nearly approximated the criteria corresponding to a 10 percent rating.

In an April 2004 dental health questionnaire, the Veteran denied a history of high blood pressure. See also July 2004 Smallpox Vaccination questionnaire. On August 8, 2005, the Veteran presented to the clinic as a result of a motor vehicle accident. His blood pressure was measured at 156 systolic, 102 diastolic. Id. August 9, 2005, the Veteran was noted to have high blood pressure. Reading at the appointment was 135 systolic over 95 diastolic. Blood pressure readings were noted from previous days as 146/90 (August 10), 138/90 (August 11), and 132/94 (August 12). Id.  The Veteran was assessed with hypertension. November 2005 Annual medical review shows the Veteran reported an August 2005 car accident with no apparent injuries or health issues. The Veteran was found to not have high blood pressure at the time. 

Private medical records were submitted in July 2019 and included encounters and procedures, clinical documents, imaging results, lab results, and flowsheets from February 2015 to July 2019. Private medical records show several blood pressure readings from October 2013 to October 2018. The results are as follows: 140/100 (October 4, 2013), 144/100 (October 21, 2013), 142/110 (November 2013), 130/110 (December 2, 2013), 132/68 (December 30, 2013), 150/90 (November 2014), 150/108 (February 2015), 142/98 (June 2015), 132/92 (July 2015), 124/80 (March 2016), 128/88 (November 2016), 126/83 (November 2017), and 133/88 (October 2018). A February 2015 visit noted the Veteran reported no lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, edema, or calf pain with exertion. The Veteran was advised to limit or avoid salt. The physician noted the Veteran was not exercising regularly. 

In July 2019, the Veteran presented for a VA examination. The examiner noted a review of the available records, to include the submitted private medical records. The Veteran reported being diagnosed in 2005 and starting medication in 2008. The examiner noted there were no follow-up notes after service until the February 2015 treatment record. It was indicated the Veteran was on continuous medication. Blood pressure readings were 119/69, 128/82, and 124/78. After a review of the evidence, the examiner found that the Veteran did not have a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevated to predominantly 100 or more. She noted there was no functional impact due to the diagnosed hypertension. 

To the extent the Veteran, through his representative, argues that the VA examination is inadequate as it did not discuss favorable evidence, such as the August 2005 in-service BP reading of 156/102, the Board disagrees. The Court has found there is no reasons and basis requirement on examiners, and no need for them to comment on every favorable piece of evidence in the claims file. Acevedo v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 286, 293-94 (2012). Here, the examiner acknowledged they reviewed the medical evidence and cited to the in-service August 2005 records and the private treatment records in the medical history portion of the examination. In lieu of that review, the examiner made a finding that the Veteran did not have a history of a diastolic blood pressure elevated to predominantly 100 or more.

The Board notes the Veteran does have several instances in which his diastolic pressure was measured to be more than 100. However, the Board places probative weight in the January 2019 VA examination performed by a medical professional and that professional's opinion that the Veteran did not have a history of predominantly 100 or more diastolic.  Further, the diastolic pressures have more often than not been below 100, suggesting that there is not a history of his diastolic pressure being predominantly over 100.  Accordingly, the Veteran's hypertension did not manifest in diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more.  Also, the Veteran did not have a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more and require continuous medication for control.  There is no reasonable doubt to be resolved.  The Veteran's hypertension does not more nearly approximate the criteria corresponding to a 10 percent rating.

As the criteria for a 10 percent rating under DC 7101 are not met, a noncompensable rating is warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.
