ORDER

Entitlement to waiver of recovery of an overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation benefits in the amount of $24,195.33 is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The overpayment was not due to the Veteran's fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith.

2. Recovery of the debt in this case in the amount of $24,195.33 is against equity and good conscience. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Recovery of the overpayment of the VA compensation benefits in the amount of $24,195.33 would be contrary to the principles of equity and good conscience.  38?U.S.C. §?5302; 38?C.F.R. §§?1.963(a),?1.965.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from April 2013 to March 2014 and from November 2022 to May 2023, with additional periods of service in the New York Air National Guard. 

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 Debt Increase Letter issued by the Debt Management Center, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to waiver of recovery of an overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation benefits in the amount of $24,195.33

38?U.S.C. § 5304(c) prohibits the receipt of VA disability compensation benefits for any period for which the person receives active service pay.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.654, 3.700.  This includes active duty pay, drill, and active duty for training payments, and inactive duty for training payments made to Reservists and members of the National Guard.  

The Veteran had drill days during Fiscal years (FY) 2021, 2022, and 2023, for which she received military pay.  Thus, the AOJ retroactively withheld payment for the drill days and this action resulted in an initial overpayment of $ 21,978.01.  

The Veteran sought waiver of recovery for the overpayment and in July 2023, the Committee on Waivers and Compromises granted a partial waiver, reducing the debt to $7,418.81 and a Demand letter for that amount was sent in August 2023. Subsequently, in September 2023, the AOJ discovered additional drill dates for FY 2022, and informed the Veteran that her debt had increased by $16,776.52 to a new balance of $24,195.33 in October 2023.  The Veteran timely appealed in November 2023 seeking waiver of the new debt.

In the partial waiver of the initial amount of debt, the Committee on Waivers and Compromises (Committee) did not find fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith in this case and the Board agrees.

In the July 2023 partial waiver, the Committee found the Veteran was at fault for not reporting her return to active duty, found financial hardship, "as your income does not meet your expenses and you have minimal/no assets," found partial unjust enrichment since the Veteran's VA compensation was terminated, and determined that the debt repayment would not defeat the purpose of the benefit, and changed position was not for application.

In cases where fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith on the Veteran's part with respect to the creation of the overpayment at issue has not been demonstrated, and, therefore, waiver is not precluded pursuant to 38 U.S.C. §?5302(a), the Board must determine whether recovery of the indebtedness would be against equity and good conscience, thereby permitting waiver under 38 U.S.C. §?5302(a) and 38?C.F.R. §§?1.963(a), 1.965(a).  In making this determination, consideration is given to the following elements, which are not intended to be all-inclusive: (1) fault of debtor (where actions of the debtors contribute to the creation of the debt); (2) balancing of faults (weighing fault of the debtor vs. the fault of VA); (3) undue hardship (whether collection would deprive the debtor or family of basic necessities); (4) defeat the purpose (whether withholding of benefits or recovery would nullify the objective for which benefits were intended); (5) unjust enrichment (failure to make restitution would result in unfair gain to the debtor); and (6) changing position to one's detriment (reliance on VA benefits results in relinquishment of a valuable right or incurrence of a legal obligation).  See 38?C.F.R. § 1.965(a).  

The Veteran submitted a Financial Status Report (FSR) in June 2023.  She explained, "After miscarrying our first baby, my husband left his job and moved across the country to be with me.  He has not been able to find work.  I am supporting us both so we can be together.  We have another baby on the way.  This will be our first child together."  The FSR shows expenses exceeding income by over $1,000.00 and no assets, with several credit card balances.

The first and second elements pertain to the fault of the debtor versus the fault of VA.  Here, the Veteran did not report her active duty pay so she was at fault.  

The Board now considers whether the Veteran would suffer undue financial hardship if forced to repay the debt at issue.  As noted above, the FSR reveals that her expenses exceed her income by about $1000.00 per month and there are no assets.  Moreover, while the Veteran's husband is looking for work, she is supporting the family with only her National Guard pay, as her VA compensation payments have been terminated while she is serving in the National Guard.  As such, recoupment of the debt at issue in this appeal would cause undue hardship such that the Veteran and her family would not be able to afford the basic necessities of living (housing, food, clothing, utilities, transportation, insurance).

In regard to whether failure to collect would cause unjust enrichment to the debtor, the Board notes that VA has terminated the Veteran's compensation benefits.  The Committee noted that there was no unjust enrichment since June 2021 and the Veteran listed no VA compensation on her FSR.  As such, no unjust enrichment has occurred since her benefits were terminated. 

As to whether recoupment of those benefits would defeat the purpose of the benefit, recoupment of those benefits would not defeat the purpose of the benefit since the Veteran was not entitled to both VA compensation pay, and concurrent active duty or drill pay.  

There is no indication that the Veteran's reliance on VA benefits resulted in relinquishment of another valuable right.  

Weighing the principles of equity and good conscience, the Board finds that the factors of undue financial hardship and the overall lack of unjust enrichment outweigh the factor of fault on behalf of the Veteran.  

Accordingly, a waiver of recovery of the overpayment in the amount of $24,195.33 is warranted, and the appeal is granted.
