ORDER

Service connection for skin cancer is denied.

Service connection for diabetes type II is denied.

Service connection for teeth loss is denied.

Service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence weighs persuasively against a finding that the Veteran was exposed to herbicides during his active-duty service.

2. The Veteran's skin cancer initially manifested many years after separation from service and is not shown to be etiologically related to service.  

3. The Veteran's diabetes type II initially manifested many years after separation from service and is not shown to be etiologically related to service.  

4. The Veteran's teeth loss initially manifested many years after separation from service and is not shown to be etiologically related to service.  

5. The Veteran died in October 2021.

6. At the time of his death, the Veteran was service connected for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.

7. The Veteran's immediate causes of death were acute respiratory failure and COVID-19.  Other conditions contributing to death included diabetes mellitus, antiphospholipid syndrome, history of pulmonary embolism, class 3 morbid obesity, sick sinus syndrome, and obstructive sleep apnea.

8. The evidence weighs persuasively against finding that the disabilities that caused or contributed substantially or materially to cause the Veteran's death were etiologically related to his active-duty service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Skin cancer was not incurred in or aggravated by service and may not be presumed to be a result of service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309.  

2. Diabetes type II was not incurred in or aggravated by service and may not be presumed to be a result of service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309.  

3. Teeth loss was not incurred in or aggravated by service and may not be presumed to be a result of service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1116, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.307, 3.309.  

4. The criteria for service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1116, 1131, 1310, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309, 3.312.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the Navy from August 1961 to April 1962.  He died in October 2021.  The appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse.  

With regard to the skin cancer, diabetes, and teeth loss claims, the rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In October 2022, the appellant submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the September 2022 decision.  In a January 2023 decision, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development.  In July 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claims based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.  The July 2023 decision also constituted an initial decision with regard to the claim for service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.  

In the July 19, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the appellant elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge on December 9, 2024 and a transcript is of record.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2023 AOJ decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant or representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

Evidence was added to the claims file between the July 2023 AOJ decision and the appellant's Notice of Disagreement, which was during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed.  As the Board is deciding the claims, it may not consider this evidence in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  The appellant may file a Supplemental Claim and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Neither the appellant nor her representative have raised any issue with the duty to notify or duty to assist with regard to the issues being decided on the merits below that occurred prior to the rating decisions on appeal.???See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board.");?Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying?Scott?to a duty to assist argument).? 

1. Skin Cancer

2. Diabetes Type II

3. Teeth Loss

The appellant contends, and the Veteran contended prior to his death, that the Veteran's skin cancer, diabetes, and teeth loss were due to exposure to herbicides during his active-duty service.  

Service connection may be established for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Regulations also provide that service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2009). 

The presumption of service connection applies to anyone who served on active duty for 90 days of active, continuous service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(1); Biggins v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 474, 478 (1991).  Post-service development of diabetes mellitus to a degree of 10 percent within one year from the date of termination of such service, establishes a rebuttable presumption that the disease was incurred in service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  Evidence of continuity of symptomatology from the time of service until the present is required where the chronicity of a condition manifested during service either has not been established or might reasonably be questioned.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(b), 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).  

The appellant has not contended, and the Veteran did not contend, that any of the disabilities on appeal had their onset during his active-duty service or within one year after separation and the Board has found no evidence of onset during that period.  Therefore, presumptive service connection is not warranted for type II diabetes under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a). 

The benefit of the doubt rule provides that an appellant will prevail in a case where the positive evidence is in approximate balance with the negative evidence.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  It is only when the weight of the evidence is persuasively against the claim that the claim must be denied.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).     

VA regulations provide that a veteran who had active military, naval, or air service in the Republic of Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975, shall be presumed to have been exposed to herbicides unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed.  38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(iii).  Service in the Republic of Vietnam includes service in the waters offshore and service in other locations if the conditions of service involved duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam.  Id.  VA shall treat a location as being offshore of Vietnam if the location is not more than 12 nautical miles seaward of a line commencing on the southwestern demarcation line of the waters of Vietnam and Cambodia.  38 U.S.C. § 1116A(d).  

Certain diseases are deemed associated with herbicide exposure under current law.  The list of those diseases includes diabetes mellitus, type II.  38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).  

If a veteran did not serve in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam era, actual exposure to herbicides must be verified through appropriate service department or other sources in order for the presumption of service connection for an herbicide-related diseased under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e) to be applicable.  Exposure to herbicides is not presumed in such instances.  However, once exposure to herbicides has been established by the evidence of record, the presumption of service connection found in 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e) for herbicide-related diseases is applicable.

The Veteran contended, and the appellant continues to contend, that he served on the USS Washtenaw County (LST-1166) and that, during his service, the Washtenaw County traveled to both the offshore (blue) and inland (brown) waters of the Republic of Vietnam, as well as Da Nang harbor, and that he was therefore exposed to herbicides.  In an August 2019 statement, the Veteran contended that the water used on the ship was taken from Vietnam's rivers and was contaminated by herbicides.  The Veteran and the appellant have submitted copies of the Wikipedia entry for the Washtenaw County, which notes "a trip or two to South Vietnam during the initial stages of the American presence there" at some point between 1960 and 1964.  

VA has examined available naval records for the Washtenaw County for 1961 and 1962 and found that the ship ventured into the offshore waters of the Republic of Vietnam in 1962, but in June, two months after the Veteran's separation from active duty service.  In plotting the reported locations of the Washtenaw County between January 1962 and April 1962, VA has found that, during that period, the Washtenaw traveled no closer to the Republic of Vietnam than the approximate location of the Philippines, hundreds of miles away.  In addition, the Veteran's service treatment records note treatment at the US Naval Hospital in Yokosuka, Japan for motion sickness in February 1962 and the Washtenaw County's deck logs for the day of his admission to the hospital also note that the ship was in Yokosuka, Japan on that date.  These findings are highly probative and the Board accepts them as the most persuasive evidence of the location of the Washtenaw County during this period.  The Board finds the Veteran's contentions to the contrary not credible, as human memory is fallible and his assertions are not supported by the record.  The Board therefore finds that a presumption of exposure to herbicides is not warranted in this case.  

The appellant must therefore establish actual exposure by other means.  Because the Veteran professed no specialized ability to detect herbicide agents in the environment, outside of labeled containers, his assertions of exposure by using contaminated water are essentially speculative.  See Bardwell v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 36 (2010).  His lay statements alone are not sufficient to establish that exposure to herbicide agents actually occurred, particularly when they depend on the premise that the water used on the ship was taken from a location where the ship was not present.  

For all of the above reasons, the Board finds that that the Veteran was not exposed to herbicides during his active-duty service.  

In addition, the record does not reflect, and the appellant does not contend and the Veteran did not contend, that type II diabetes, skin cancer, or teeth loss had their onset in service.  The Veteran's service treatment records do not reflect any complaint or diagnosis of those disabilities or any relevant symptoms and, although the dates of the initial diagnoses are not clear, there is nothing to indicate that they were in 1961 or 1962 or for decades thereafter.   

The only basis the Veteran and appellant have raised for service connection for type II diabetes, skin cancer, or teeth loss is exposure to herbicides.  The Board has found that the Veteran was not exposed to herbicides.  The Veteran and appellant have not contended that any other injury or illness in service could have caused these disabilities and the Board has found no evidence of onset in service or within several decades thereafter to establish direct service connection.  VA has conceded that the Veteran's teeth loss was caused by his diabetes but, because his diabetes was not service-connected, service connection for teeth loss on a secondary basis is not possible.  

Because the evidence weighs persuasively against finding that the Veteran's type II diabetes, skin cancer, or teeth loss were etiologically related to his active-duty service, entitlement to service connection for type II diabetes, skin cancer, and teeth loss is denied.

4. Cause of the Veteran's Death

In order to establish service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death, the evidence must show that a disability incurred in or aggravated by service caused or contributed substantially or materially to cause death.  For a service-connected disability to be the cause of death it must singly, or with some other condition, be the immediate or underlying cause, or be etiologically related.  For a service-connected disability to constitute a contributory cause, it is not sufficient to show that it casually shared in producing death; but, rather, it must be shown that there was a causal connection.  38 C.F.R. § 3.312.  There are primary causes of death which, by their very nature, are so overwhelming that eventual death can be anticipated irrespective of coexisting conditions, but even in such cases, there is for consideration whether there may be a reasonable basis for holding that a service-connected condition was of such severity as to have had a material influence in accelerating death.  In this situation, however, it would not generally be reasonable to hold that a service-connected condition accelerated death unless such condition affected a vital organ and was itself of a progressive or debilitating nature.  38 C.F.R. § 3.312(c)(4).  

At the time of his death, the Veteran had established service connection only for bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus.  The Veteran's death certificate indicates that the immediate causes of his October 2021 death were acute respiratory failure and COVID-19.  Other conditions contributing to death included diabetes mellitus, antiphospholipid syndrome, history of pulmonary embolism, class 3 morbid obesity, sick sinus syndrome, and obstructive sleep apnea.  

The appellant has not argued that the Veteran's hearing loss or tinnitus caused or contributed substantially or materially to the Veteran's death.  Instead, the appellant has argued for service connection for the Veteran's death based on herbicide exposure.  Because the Board has found that the Veteran was not exposed to herbicides, service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death based on herbicide exposure is also not warranted.  Although the appellant has not argued for service connection based on the Veteran's diabetes, the Board notes that diabetes mellitus is listed on the death certificate.  However, because service connection for diabetes has also been denied, service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death based on his diabetes is also not warranted.  The appellant has made no other argument in favor of service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death.  

Because the evidence is persuasively against finding that the disabilities that caused or substantially or materially contributed to the Veteran's death were etiologically related to active-duty service, service connection for the cause of the Veteran's death is denied.
