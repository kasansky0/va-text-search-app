ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinea versicolor (also claimed as a skin condition) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

The appeal for entitlement to service connection for tinea versicolor has been granted during the pendency of the appeal.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

As the issue of entitlement to service connection for tinea versicolor has been granted in full, there remains no justiciable case or controversy as to the service connection claim.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from June 1991 to September 1997. 

This appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) arose from an April 2024 rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  In April 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Service connection for tinea versicolor.

As an initial matter, the Board notes that the Veteran has claimed entitlement to service connection for tinea versicolor and for a "skin condition" in general.  See July 2023 VA 21-526EZ; see also October 2023 VA 21-526EZ.  It was found, at the Veteran's April 2024 VA examination, that the Veteran's only skin condition was tinea versicolor.  See April 2024 C&P Exam.  As the evidence provides that the claimed symptoms relate to a particular condition, his claim is characterized as one of entitlement to service connection for tinea versicolor.  Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 5 (2009). 

In April 2024, the AOJ denied entitlement to service connection for tinea versicolor, and the Veteran submitted VA Form 10182 later in the same month.  Then, in May 2024, the AOJ recognized that there was a clear and unmistakable error in the prior denial and entitlement to service connection for tinea versicolor was granted.  See May 2024 Rating Decision - Narrative. 

When an appealed claim is granted in full during the pendency of the appeal, no case or controversy remains.  See Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156, 1158-59 (Fed. Cir. 1997); Holland v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 433 (1997); see also Grantham v. Brown, 114 F.3d 1156 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (where an appealed claim for service connection is granted during the pendency of the appeal, a second Notice of Disagreement must thereafter be timely filed to initiate appellate review of "downstream" issues such as the compensation level assigned for the disability or the effective date of service connection). 

Under VA laws and regulations, the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.  In this case, the May 2024 rating decision granted the full benefit sought on appeal (i.e., service connection for tinea versicolor). 

Therefore, the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal, and dismissal of the appeal is warranted.  Id.
