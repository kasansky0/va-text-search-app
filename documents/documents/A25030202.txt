ORDER

From April 1, 2019, a 20-percent evaluation for bilateral tinea pedis, for accrued purposes, is allowed.

An earlier effective date for service connection for tinnitus, for accrued purposes, is denied.

From July 16, 2018, a 100-percent evaluation for an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and a depressed mood (previously evaluated as a generalized anxiety disorder), for accrued purposes, is allowed.

From April 1, 2020, a special monthly compensation (SMC) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s) is allowed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Allowing reasonable doubt to the Veteran, throughout the entire period on appeal, his tinea pedis of the bilateral feet manifested as pain analogous to a painful and unstable scar from April 1, 2019.

2. On April 1, 2020, VA received the Veteran's VA 21-0966 Intent to File, and on August 18, 2020, VA received the Veteran's claim for service connection for tinnitus.

3. The evidence demonstrates the Veteran had an increase in his service-connected skin condition of the bilateral feet within the one year look back period prior to April 1, 2020, i.e., April 1, 2019.

4. On July 16, 2019, VA received the Veteran's VA 21-0966 Intent to File, and the Veteran submitted his VA 21-526EZ on October 23, 2019, for an increase as to his service-connected psychiatric condition.

5. The evidence demonstrates the Veteran had an increase in his service-connected psychiatric disability within the one year look back period prior to July 16, 2019, i.e., July 16, 2018.

6. The VA psychological examinations of December 2019 and January 2020 establishes the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric condition was productive of total occupational or social impairment from July 16, 2018.

7. From April 1, 2020, the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric condition is now independently rated as 100-percent disabling, and his other service-connected disabilities are independently rated as 60 percent or more.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. From April 1, 2019, the criteria for a separate 20-percent disability rating, but no higher, throughout the entire period on appeal, for tinea pedis of the bilateral feet are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.118, Diagnostic Codes (DC) 7804.

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than April 1, 2020, for the allowance of service connection for tinnitus have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5103, 5103A; 5110, 7104; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

3. From July 16, 2018, the severity, frequency, and duration of the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms more closely approximate total occupational and social impairment.

4. From April 1, 2020, the criteria for an SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s) are met.  38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102, 3.350.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from April 1975 to April 1978.

Unfortunately, the Veteran died in September 2021.  The Appellant is the Veteran's surviving spouse, and she properly filed a request to be substituted as the claimant in these matters.  See March 2022 Request for Substitution.  The Agency of Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted the Appellant's substitution request in March 2022.

The Board would be remiss if it did not extend its sincere condolences to the Appellant for the loss of her spouse and recognizes the valuable service he provided to this country.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2022 rating decision.  The Veteran timely appealed this decision to the Board in a December 2023 Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182) and requested a direct review by a Veterans Law Judge.  Since the Veteran chose direct review, the Board, in adjudicating this matter, may consider evidence associated with the record through the December 2022 rating decision on appeal.

Increased Ratings

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the facts presented to VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) at 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and the residual conditions in civilian occupations.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321 (a), 4.1.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  Nevertheless, the Board acknowledges a claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  The analysis in the following decision is therefore undertaken with consideration of the possibility that different ratings may be warranted for different time periods.

Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability should be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that evaluation.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  A claim will be denied if the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

1. A 20-percent evaluation for bilateral tinea pedis, for accrued purposes, is allowed.

The Appellant seeks entitlement to a compensable rating for the Veteran's tinea pedis of the bilateral feet.  See December 2023 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

For increased rating claims, 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(3) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2) potentially allow for an increase in disability compensation of up to one year prior to the date of claim, if it is factually ascertainable based on all evidence of record that an increase in disability had occurred.  As such, the relevant appeal period for this increased rating claim includes the one-year look-back period prior to the April 1, 2020, which is the date VA received the Veteran's VA 21-0966 Intent to File, until the Veteran's death in September 2021.  See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (referencing the "'one-year look-back period'").  As such, the period on appeal begins on April 1, 2019, and ends in September 2021.

The Board notes VA amended the criteria for rating skin disabilities effective from August 13, 2018.  These new regulations apply to all applications for benefits received by VA or that are pending before the agency of original jurisdiction on or after August 13, 2018.  As the Veteran's intent to file was filed on April 1, 2020, the amended regulations apply.

The Veterans' service-connected skin condition was evaluated under DCs 7806-7813.  Hyphenated DCs are used when a rating under one DC requires use of an additional DC to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned.  The additional code is shown after a hyphen.  38 C.F.R. § 4.27.

An indicated in the prior paragraph, the Veteran's skin disability was evaluated under DC 7806 for dermatitis.  Currently, under DC 7806, which is evaluated under the General Rating Formula for the Skin, a noncompensable (0 percent) rating is warranted if no more than topical therapy was required over the past 12-month period and at least one of the following was present: characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected or characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected.  A 10-percent rating is warranted for characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or if intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs have been required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.  A 30-percent rating is warranted for characteristic lesions involving 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or if systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs have been required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period.  A 60-percent rating is warranted for characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or if constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs have been required over the past 12-month period.  38 U.S.C. § 4.118, DC 7806.

Also, under the new General Rating Formula for the Skin, the rating criteria notes that for the purposes of that section, systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route (orally, injection, suppository, intranasally) other than the skin, and topical therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin.  38 U.S.C. § 4.118 (a).

Turning to the evidence of record, at a December 2020 skin examination a VA examiner documents symptoms of tired, achy, sore feet, in addition to constant pain.  Treatment consisted of ketoconazole shampoo, hydrophilic topical cream, urea cream, povidone iodine, Lamisil, vaporizing rub, terbinafine cream, hydrochloride, and Tinactin.  The examiner indicates the Veteran used his skin medications topically at a constant or near constant rate.  The examiner documented dermatophytosis erythematous with scattered cracking and peeling of the skin of the plantar surfaces of the feet with macerated interspaces of the feet or toes.  The Veteran's dermatophytosis was found to consist of less than five percent of the total body area with no skin condition of the exposed area.  The examiner did not find a skin condition without any visible characteristic lesions at the time of the examination.  No tumors or neoplasms were found.  No other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs, or symptoms were found.  Functional impacts included an inability to work in wet environments.

After a review of the claims file in conjunction with the applicable laws and regulations, the Board finds that granting reasonable doubt to the Veteran, his skin condition of the bilateral feet warrants a 20-percent rating analogous to a painful and unstable scar under DC 7804 throughout the entire period on appeal, i.e., April 1, 2019, and ends in September 2021.

Under DC 7804, one or two scars that are unstable or painful warrant a 10-percent evaluation.  Three or four scars that are unstable or painful warrant a 20-percent evaluation.  Note (2) provides if one or more scars are both unstable and painful, add 10 percent to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars.  38 U.S.C. § 4.118, DC 7804.

As indicated in the prior paragraph, in awarding the 20-percent evaluation, the Board observes Note (2) states if one or more scars are both unstable and painful, add 10 percent to the evaluation that is based on the total number of unstable or painful scars.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118, DC 7804, Note (2).  The December 2020 examination documents constant pain of the feet in addition to dermatophytosis erythematous with scattered cracking and peeling to skin to most of plantar surfaces of feet and macerated interspaces of the feet.  Thus, the evidence shows a disability presentation analogous to two painful and unstable scars, warranting the additional 10 percent.

The Board finds the December 2020 examination report supports that an increase in the Veteran's disability had occurred within one year from the receipt of the VA 21-0966 Intent to File on April 1, 2020, which can be inferred from the lay evidence within that examination report.

In this case, higher evaluations are unwarranted.  The December 2020 examination documents the Veteran used topical therapy or treatment administered through the skin.  Further, his condition was found to consist of less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected.  Further, under DC 7804, separate evaluations are not contemplated by the rating criteria or the accompanying notes for DC 7804.  See 38 U.S.C. § 4.118, DC 7804.  Since the rating criteria under DC 7804 do not contemplate separate evaluations for different zones of the body, the bilateral factor does not apply in this case.

In conclusion, the Board finds allowing reasonable doubt to the Veteran, the Board finds a 20-percent evaluation, but no higher, is warranted for the Veteran's skin condition of the bilateral feet throughout the entire period on appeal, i.e., April 1, 2019, through September 2021.

Effective Dates

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i), the effective date for a grant of direct service connection will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service.  Otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.

In addition, except as otherwise provided, the effective date of an award of an increased rating shall be the date of receipt of claim or date the entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(1).

Any communication indicating an intent to apply for a benefit under the laws administered by VA may be considered an informal claim provided it identifies, but not necessarily with specificity, the benefit sought.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (a).  To determine when a claim was received, the Board must review all communications in the claims file that may be construed as an application or claim.  See Quarles v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 129, 134 (1992).

2. An earlier effective date for service connection for tinnitus, for accrued purposes, is denied.

The Appellant seeks an effective date earlier than April 1, 2020, for the award of service connection for tinnitus.  See December 2023 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  While the Appellant indicates an earlier effective date is warranted, neither she nor her attorney has identified any basis for such a grant.

Initially, the Board observes the Veteran separated from active-duty military service on April 21, 1978, which is more than one year prior to filing this initial clam for benefits; therefore, the provision which could establish his effective date on the day after he separated form service does not apply.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).

After a review of the claims file, the Board finds the evidence of record is against an effective date earlier than April 1, 2020.  On April 1, 2020, VA received the Veteran's intent to file.  Subsequently, VA received the Veteran's claim for service connection claim for tinnitus on August 18, 2020.  See August 2020 VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim.  In a March 2021 rating decision, the RO granted service connection for tinnitus effective April 1, 2020, which is the date VA received the Veteran's intent to file.

Further, in their March 2022 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review, the Appellant asserts entitlement to service connection for tinnitus from August 8, 1978, under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. 3.156 (b) and (c).  However, the record does not contain any formal or informal claim for tinnitus prior to April 1, 2020.  As there was no prior claim for service connection filed for tinnitus and no previous rating decision had adjudicated the issue, an earlier effective date is not available under 38 C.F.R. 3.156 (b) and (c).

Finally, the Board notes the one-year look-back period does not apply for this claim, as the appellate history stems from the original rating decision that granted service connection, rather than a new claim for an increased rating, filed after the original rating decision granting service connection.  Gaston, 605 F.3d at 982.

The Board finds no basis in the law or facts in this case for an effective date for service connection for tinnitus earlier than April 1, 2020.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Herein, the appropriate effective date is the date of receipt of the Veteran's intent to file by VA, which is April 1, 2020.  For these reasons, the claim is denied.

3. From July 16, 2018, a 100-percent evaluation for an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and a depressed mood (previously evaluated as a generalized anxiety disorder), for accrued purposes, is allowed.

The Appellant seeks an earlier effective date with respect to the evaluation for the Veteran's evaluation of his service-connected psychiatric condition.  See December 2023 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.  

The Veteran's service-connected adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and a depressed mood was rated at 10 percent from October 23, 1986, to July 15, 2019, 50 percent from July 16, 2019, to March 31, 2020, and 70 percent from April 1, 2020, to September 2021.  See December 2022 Codesheet.  For the following reasons, the Board finds the criteria for an effective date of July 16, 2018, for the assignment of an increased disability rating of 100 percent for the Veteran's service-connected adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and a depressed mood are met.

According to 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2), the effective date of an award of increased disability compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if the application is received within one year from such date.  Gaston, 605 F.3d at 979 (explaining that the legislative history of 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2) was to provide Veterans a one-year "grace period" for filing a claim following an increase in severity of a service-connected disability).  Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of VA receipt of the claim for increase, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a), (b)(2); Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511 (1997); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997). Gaston, 605 F.3d at 982.

The Board finds it prudent to first identify the period on appeal.  Here, the Veteran submitted a VA 21-0966 Intent to File on July 16, 2019.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.  He then submitted a VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim on October 23, 2019, for an increase as to his service-connected psychiatric condition.

The next question relevant to determining the proper effective date for an increased rating claim is whether there is evidence demonstrating a factually ascertainable date that an increase in the Veteran's disability had occurred within one year from the date the Veteran's intent to file, i.e., July 16, 2018.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).  This is also known as the one-year-look-back window.

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and their residual disorders in civil occupations.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321 (a), 4.1.

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

The Veteran's service-connected psychiatric condition was rated under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9440.

Under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, a 50-percent rating is warranted for occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as: flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.  Id.

A 70-percent rating is assigned when the psychiatric condition produces occupational and social impairment, with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  Id.

A 100-percent rating is warranted when there is total occupational or social impairment due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place, memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  Id.

Turning to the evidence of record, VA received a psychiatric examination in December 2019.  The examiner notes leisure interests and social activities included speaking on the phone with a friend on a weekly basis.  The Veteran reported since his last examination in 1986, his difficulties with social functioning had worsened significantly as he reported experiencing intense anxiety around people and avoidance behaviors.  The examiner indicates the Veteran reported that a struggle with thoughts and feelings made the performance of his social and work responsibilities difficult.  For example, the Veteran reported he has reduced or completely missed household work during 20 of the last 30 days.  Current symptoms were documented to include anxiety and worrying, becoming easily annoyed or irritable, a difficulty with concentration or decision-making, feeling muscle tension, feeling restlessness, having a difficulty with sleeping, feeling depressed or hopelessness, strong negative self-evaluative thoughts or shame, a loss of interest, and having low energy or fatigue.

Further, the examination report indicates the Veteran's symptoms were found to include a depressed mood; anxiety; panic attacks more than once a week; chronic sleep impairment; a flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory or stereotyped speech; impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; a difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.

Finally, the examiner indicates the Veteran's degrees of difficulty were found to include severe effects on cognition, severe effects on selfcare, severe effects on social functioning, severe effects on household functioning, severe effects on work functioning, and severe effects on an ability to participate.

The Veteran submitted a VA psychiatric examination in January 2020.  The examiner found the Veteran's occupational and social impairment to consist of total occupational and social impairment.

The Veteran's symptoms were found to include a depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; panic attacks more than once a week; chronic sleep impairment; mild memory loss, such as forgetting names, directions, or recent events; impairment of short- and long-term memory, for example, retention of only highly learned material, while forgetting to complete tasks; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name; disturbances of motivation and mood; a difficulty establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; a difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a worklike setting; an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships; suicidal ideation; persistent delusions or hallucinations; and flashbacks.

The Board finds the December 2019 and January 2020 examination reports support an increased rating of 100 percent from July 16, 2018, as it can be inferred from the lay evidence that an increase in the Veteran's disability had occurred within one year from the receipt of the VA 21-0966 Intent to File on July 16, 2019.

Regarding this, the Board finds the above evidence supports a 100-percent evaluation from July 16, 2018, through to September 2021 because the January 2020 psychiatric examination documents severe psychiatric symptoms that more closely approximate the criteria for a 100-percent rating.  The report documents symptoms that reflect a gross impairment in thought processes or communication, e.g., the December 2019 examiner found severe effects on the Veteran's social and occupational functioning, and the January 2020 examiner found symptoms that included persistent delusions or hallucinations and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.

The Board acknowledges in their March 2022 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review, the Appellant asserts entitlement to a 70-percent evaluation for a psychiatric disability, from August 8, 1978, forward, is warranted under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. 3.156 (b) and (c).

The Board observes a November 1978 rating decision continued the10-percent evaluation for the Veteran's anxiety and neurosis from April 22, 1978, which is the day after he separated from active service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i).  However, a March 29, 1982, notification letter to the Veteran indicates the Veteran's payments were discontinued as the Veteran did not attend a VA examination.  He did not file an appeal or submit new and material evidence within one year of the notification.  Therefore, the decision became final.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.1103.  VA did not receive another formal or informal claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability until October 23, 1986.  In the statement, the Veteran indicates he did not attend his VA examination in 1982 because he was trying to keep his job, and he requested another VA examination to which he indicated he would attend.  The Veteran attended a VA psychiatric examination, and a May 1987 rating decision established service connection at a 10-percent evaluation from the date of the Veteran's October 23, 1986 informal claim.  He did not file an appeal or submit new and material evidence within one year of a May 1987 notification letter.  Therefore, the decision became final.  Id.  A March 1989 notification letter informed the Veteran VA was continuing the evaluation for his service-connected psychiatric condition.  He did not file an appeal or submit new and material evidence within one year of a March 1989 notification letter.  Therefore, the decision became final.  Id.  It was not until October 23, 2019, when VA received the Veteran's VA 21-526EZ for an increase as to his service-connected psychiatric condition, that VA received another claim for this issue, which is the basis of the current grant.

Accordingly, the Veteran's prior claims became final.  The Veteran's filing of a new claim for an increased rating for his psychiatric condition did not preserve the earlier effective date of his prior claim for an increased rating.  Under the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (a), previous determinations that are final and binding, including decisions on evaluations and effective dates, will be accepted as correct in the absence of clear and unmistakable error (CUE).  In the present case, the Veteran has not asserted an allegation of CUE.  See Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 44 (1993).  As such, at the time of the Veteran's July 2019  intent to file, there were no pending, unadjudicated claims such that the issue of entitlement to an increased rating for his psychiatric condition could be inferred.

Nevertheless, as noted above, there is an exception to the general rule regarding effective dates, which allows for an effective date for an increased rating for disability compensation as of the earliest date which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if the application is received within one year from such date.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(3); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).

In this case, giving the Veteran the benefit of the doubt as to the history of his psychiatric condition, the VA psychological examinations of December 2019 and January 2020 establish the Veteran's service-connected psychiatric condition was productive of total occupational or social impairment from July 16, 2018, which is one year prior to the receipt of his July 16, 2019, intent to file.

Accordingly, based on the forgoing, the Board finds the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of July 16, 2019, but no earlier, for an increased rating of 100 percent for his service-connected psychiatric condition.

4. An SMC pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s) is allowed.

Considering the Board's decision herein, the Veteran is now in receipt of a 100-percent disability rating and has other disabilities that are independently ratable at 60 percent or more during the pertinent period on appeal, i.e., from April 1, 2020, through to September 2021.  See February 2025 Codesheet.  Accordingly, the Board finds that based on the decision herein, the criteria for an SMC under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s) have been met.
