DOCKET NO. 240619-450488
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than June 12, 2023, for the grant of service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to include alcohol use disorder is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A claim for service connection for PTSD was denied by VA in July 2019, and the Veteran did not seek review of that decision within one year.

2. VA received the Veteran's intent to file a claim on June 6, 2022.

3. More than one year after the intent to file was received, VA received the Veteran's Supplemental Claim on June 12, 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for PTSD to include alcohol use disorder have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1986 to March 1988 and from April 1988 to July 1994.

This matter comes before the?Board of Veterans' Appeals?(Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

1. Entitlement to an earlier effective date for service connection for PTSD to include alcohol use disorder

The Veteran contends that the effective date of his grant of service connection for PTSD should be earlier than June 12, 2023.

In general, the effective date for a grant of service connection is the day following the date of separation from active service or the date entitlement arose, if the claim is received within one year after separation from service. Otherwise, it is the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a), (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b). For supplemental claims received more than one year after the AOJ issues a rating decision, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date entitlement arose, but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the supplemental claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. The reference to "the date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statute or regulation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has interpreted it as the date when the claimant met the requirements for the benefits sought; this is determined on a "facts found" basis. See McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000); see also 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a).

To preserve an effective date, an intent to file a claim may be submitted to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b). Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, appropriate to the benefit sought within one-year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the intent to file a claim was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

By way of history, the Veteran originally filed a claim for service connection for disabilities of the back and ankle, and for chest pain, in July 2015.  An October 2015 rating decision denied these claims, and the Veteran submitted a notice of disagreement in September 2016, including those claims, but also listing other non-adjudicated disabilities, to include PTSD.  Notably, as a claim for PTSD had not been made and adjudicated, it was not a valid notice of disagreement for that issue. 

In October 2016, the RO notified the Veteran that if he wished to file a claim for PTSD and the other disabilities, he would need to complete and sign a claim form and that no other action would be taken until he did so.  After undertaking development, the RO ultimately denied the claim in July 2019. The Veteran did not seek review of that decision within one year. Therefore, the July 2019 rating decision became final.

In June 2022, VA indicated that it received an intent to file from the Veteran on June 6, 2022. More than one year later, the Veteran filed a Supplemental Claim on June 12, 2023. The RO granted service connection in the December 2023 rating decision on appeal, and assigned a 100 percent rating effective June 12, 2023, the date of the Veteran's Supplemental Claim. 

The Board finds that June 12, 2023, is the correct effective date for the grant of service connection for PTSD. Because the Veteran filed his Supplemental Claim more than one year after the prior final AOJ decision, his effective date cannot be earlier than the date of the Supplemental Claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. The Veteran is also not entitled to an earlier effective date based on his intent to file. Because the Veteran did not submit his completed claim within one year of his intent to file, June 6, 2022 cannot serve as the effective date for his claim. 

The Veteran is also advised that the effective date of an award of service connection is assigned not based on the date the disability appeared or the date of the earliest medical evidence demonstrating the existence of such disability and a causal connection to service or a service-connected disability; rather, the effective date is assigned based on consideration of the date that the application upon which service connection was eventually awarded was received by VA. See Lalonde v. West, 12 Vet. App. 377, 382-383 (1999).

The Board acknowledges argument by the Veteran's representative offered during higher-level review of the decision on appeal. The Veteran's representative argued that the RO failed to complete development of the Veteran's stressor for his original claim for service connection for PTSD, and that therefore an earlier effective date should be assigned.  

It appears that the Veteran's representative is attempting to attack the finality of the July 2019 rating decision that originally denied the Veteran's claim.  The only way to do so is to raise a motion to revise a prior decision based on clear and unmistakable error.  A clear and unmistakable error (CUE) is "a very specific and rare kind of 'error'... of fact or law." Fugo v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 40, 43 (1993). The error must be based on the facts and the law as they existed at the time of the challenged decision, and must be "the sort of error which, had it not been made, would have manifestly changed the outcome at the time it was made." Pierce v. Principi, 240 F.3d 1348, 1354 (2001); Russell v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 310, 314 (1992) (en banc); Bustos v. West, 179 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Additionally, duty to assist errors are not considered CUE.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.105(a)(1)(vi), 20.1403(d).

If the Veteran believes that CUE was committed by the RO in its July 2019 decision, the Veteran can file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) raising the issue of CUE. The Veteran is advised that this issue must be pled with specificity, and the burden of proof for such claims is on the appellant. See Pierce v. Principi, 240 F.3d 1348, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Berger v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 166, 169 (1997). As the issue of whether there was CUE in a prior rating decision has not been pled nor adjudicated, it is not before the Board. 

In summary, the Veteran's claim for an earlier effective date for PTSD to include alcohol use disorder is denied.
