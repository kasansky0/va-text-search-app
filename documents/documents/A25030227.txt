CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to February 20, 2021, for the grant of entitlement to service connection for PTSD with a 100 percent rating have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400.

2. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to February 20, 2021, for the grant of eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance under 38 USC chapter 35 have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.400, 3.807, 21.3021.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 2003 to January 2008.

This appeal stems from an April 2024 higher-level review decision. In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 20, 2021, for the grant of entitlement to service connection for PTSD with a 100 percent rating is denied.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to February 20, 2021, for the grant of eligibility for DEA under 38 USC chapter 35 is denied.

The Veteran appeals the effective dates for the award of service connection for PTSD and the grant of DEA eligibility.

In general, the effective date for the award of service-connected compensation is the "date of receipt of the claim, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later." 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2)(i); see 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a)(1). A claim must be on the form prescribed by the Secretary. 38 C.F.R. § 3.160.

Prior to March 24, 2015, a claimant could seek a grant of service connection via an informal claim. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57, 660 (Sept. 25, 2014); see 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (2014). An informal claim must contain that "(1) an intent to apply for benefits, (2) an identification of the benefits sought, and (3) a communication in writing." Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009).

For pending legacy claims not under the modernized review system, new and material evidence received prior to the expiration of the appeal period will be considered as having been filed in connection with the claim that was pending at the beginning of the appeal period. 38 C.F.R. § 3.156(b). "New evidence is evidence not previously part of the actual record before agency adjudicators. Material evidence means existing evidence that, by itself or when considered with previous evidence of record, relates to an unestablished fact necessary to substantiate the claim." Id. § 3.156(a). When new and material evidence is received within the appeal period, the "effective date will be as though the former decision had not been rendered." 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(q); see Davis v. McDonough, 34 Vet. App. 131, 136 (2021). Legacy claims are those that were decided prior to the February 19, 2019, effective date of the modernized review system and have not been opted into the modernized review system. See 38 C.F.R. § 19.2; 3.2400.

For purposes of entitlement to DEA benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, basic eligibility exists if, among other things, a veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable and is rated permanently and totally disabled due to service-connected disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 3501; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021. Therefore, the effective date for DEA eligibility is derivative of the effective date for the award of a 100 percent rating for PTSD because that is the date on which he is considered permanently and totally disabled due to his service-connected disabilities.

A September 2011 VA treatment record states that the Veteran met the criteria for a major depressive episode. A different September 2011 VA treatment record states that a PTSD screening test was positive. An October 2011 treatment record diagnosed the Veteran with an anxiety disorder (other than PTSD). An August 2012 psychiatry note diagnosed the Veteran with an adjustment disorder with mixed depression, mood, and anxiety.

In September 2012, the AOJ denied the Veteran's claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD. The AOJ stated that the reason for the denial was that the evidence did not show a currently diagnosed disability. The AOJ noted that the Veteran did not attend a scheduled VA examination. The cover letter informed the Veteran that he had one year to appeal the decision, and it referred him to the enclosed VA Form 4107, which contains an explanation of his appellate rights.

An October 2012 treatment record states that the Veteran was admitted to the Michigan Department of Community Health for urgent care.

The Secretary received the Veteran's supplemental claim on February 25, 2021. 

First, the Board must determine whether the September 2012 rating decision is final. When the AOJ denies a claim and the claimant does not file a Notice of Disagreement (NOD) within the one-year period following that decision, the AOJ decision becomes final. See 38 U.S.C. § 7105(c); DiCarlo v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 52, 55 (2006); Person v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 449, 550 (1993). The September 2012 rating decision and its cover letter denied entitlement to service connection for PTSD, explained the bases for the denial, and provided the Veteran with appellate rights. The Board has reviewed the record, and it finds that the Veteran did not file an NOD within one year of that decision. Therefore, the Board finds that the September 2012 rating decision is final.

Second, the Board observes that the September 2012 rating decision pre-dates February 19, 2019. Consequently, it was a pending legacy claim not under the modernized review system, and section 3.156(b) applies. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(b), 19.2. The Veteran argues that the October 2012 Michigan Department of Community Health admission is new and material evidence because "it supports [that] he was being treated for a diagnosed psychological condition." See May 2024 Argument. However, the Board observes that a treatment record from October 2011 demonstrate that the Veteran was being treated for an anxiety disorder (other than PTSD), and a treatment record from August 2012 shows treatment for an adjustment disorder with mixed depression, mood, and anxiety. Because the record already contained treatment for psychological conditions prior to the September 2012 rating decision, the Board finds that the October 2012 record is, at best, duplicative and not material evidence. Therefore, an earlier effective date under section 3.156(b) is not warranted.

Third, the Board finds that there is no evidence that the Veteran sought to reopen his claim prior to February 20, 2021. The record contains a supplemental claim stamped as received on February 25, 2021. The Board has carefully reviewed the record, and it can find no document that can be construed as a request to reopen his claim prior to that date. Although the AOJ assigned a February 20th rather than February 25th effective date, there is no basis for the Board to disturb the assigned effective date. Because the Veteran did not submit a claim to reopen prior to February 20, 2021, the Board is convinced that the record does not establish entitlement to an earlier effective date for the grant of service connection for PTSD. Further, because the effective date for eligibility for DEA is derivative of the Veteran's 100 percent rating for PTSD, the Veteran is also not entitled to an earlier effective date for DEA eligibility.

The Board notes that the Veteran also argues that he is entitled to an earlier effective date due to clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in the September 2012 rating decision. See May 2024 Argument. The Veteran raised these CUE allegations in May 2024, which is after the AOJ decision on appeal. "Although a claimant may file an NOD as to a claim adjudicated below, nothing in an NOD could confer jurisdiction upon the Board over a claim that was never presented to and adjudicated by the [AOJ] because there is no decision on such a newly raised claim to appeal to the Board." Jarrell v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 326, 331 (2006) (en banc). Consequently, the Board cannot consider the Veteran's CUE allegations in the first instance, and it encourages him to pursue those allegations with the AOJ if he wants VA to adjudicate them.

Accordingly, the most probative evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claims for an effective date prior to February 20, 2021, for the grant of entitlement to service connection for PTSD with a 100 percent rating and eligibility for DEA benefits, and the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-782 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Therefore, the appeals are denied.
