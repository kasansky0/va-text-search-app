ORDER

Service connection for hypertension is granted.

REMANDED

Service connection for a low back disability is remanded.

Service connection for sinusitis is remanded.

Service connection for a left knee disability is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran served on active duty in the Southwest Asia theater of operations from May 2012 through September 2012.

2. The Veteran's hypertension manifested to a compensable degree within one year of separation from his period of active service from August 30, 2005 to November 30, 2005 and is not attributable to intercurrent causes.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for hypertension are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had a period of initial active duty training (IADT) in the U.S. Air Force Reserve (USAFR) from February 1989 to June 1989, and periods of active service from March 1996 to August 1996, August 2005 to November 2005, and April 2012 to November 2012. He also had additional periods of service in the USAFR and in the Mississippi Air National Guard (MS ANG).

In July 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of the issues of service connection for hypertension, a lumbar spine disability, a left knee disability, and sinusitis most recently addressed in a June 2022 rating decision. 

In November 2022, December 2022, and January 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decisions on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claims of service connection based on the evidence of record at the time of those decisions. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decisions on appeal. 

The November 2022 rating decision denied service connection for hypertension and a lumbar spine disability, the December 2022 rating decision denied service connection for a left knee disability, and the January 2023 rating decision denied service connection for sinusitis.

In the November 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, as to the issues of service connection for hypertension and a lumbar spine disability, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 AOJ decision on appeal as to those issues. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. As to the issue of service connection for a left knee disability, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. As to the issue of service connection for sinusitis, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2023 AOJ decision on appeal. Any evidence submitted after each of the AOJ decisions on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of service connection for a back disability, sinusitis and a left knee disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three elements required to establish service connection are: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

In cases where a veteran served continuously for 90 days or more during a period of active service, certain chronic diseases will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

Active military service includes (1) active duty, but also (2) any period of active duty for training (ADT) during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from a disease or an injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty, and (3) any period of inactive duty training (IDT) during which the individual concerned was disabled or died from an injury, but not disease, incurred or aggravated in the line of duty or from an acute myocardial infarction, a cardiac arrest, or a cerebrovascular accident that occurred during such training. 38 U.S.C. § 101(24) (B); 38 C.F.R. § 3.6(a).

As a threshold matter, "veteran" status must be established as a condition of eligibility for service connection benefits. Bowers v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 201, 206 (2013) (observing that it is "axiomatic that, to receive VA disability compensation benefits, a claimant must first establish veteran status"). To establish status as a veteran based upon a period of ADT, a claimant must establish that he was disabled from disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the line of duty during that period of ADT. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(a), (d); Harris v. West, 13 Vet. App. 509 (2000).

To have basic eligibility for veterans' benefits based on a period of duty as a member of a state Army National Guard, a National Guardsman must have been ordered into Federal service by the President of the United States, see 10 U.S.C. § 12401, or must have performed "full-time duty" under the provisions of 32 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505. Allen v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 54, 58 (2007) (citing 38 U.S.C. §§ 101(21), (22)(C); 32 U.S.C. §§ 316, 502(a)(2), 503, 504, 505). 

The Veteran had periods of active service from March 26, 1996 to August 10, 1996, August 30, 2005 to November 30, 2005, and April 1, 2012 to November 17, 2012, and has established veteran status as to those periods. 

The Veteran also had a period of IADT in the USAFR from February 22, 1989 to June 6, 1989, additional periods of service in the USAFR until January 2003, and additional periods of service in the MS ANG from January 2003 to January 31, 2013. 

Every veteran shall be taken to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at the time of examination, acceptance, and enrollment, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1111; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b). Only such conditions as are recorded in examination reports are to be considered as noted. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b). A history of a preservice condition recorded on entrance examination does not constitute a notation of that condition. 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b)(1). 

The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act, was enacted on August 10, 2022. Section 405 of the PACT Act reduces the threshold for establishing eligibility when considering presumptive service connection for Persian Gulf War veterans. Presumptive conditions under 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(a) and (b) may now manifest to any degree at any time. There is no longer a requirement for a chronic disability to manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more prior to December 31, 2026. The end date is no longer applicable and will be removed in a forthcoming regulation.  

Additionally, the PACT expanded the definition of a Persian Gulf veteran to include those who served in the countries of Afghanistan, Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Syria, and Jordan, along with those who served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e).  

Pursuant to the PACT Act, exposure to burn pits and other toxins (BPOT) is presumed for "covered veterans," i.e., those who served in specific locations on or after specific dates. 38 U.S.C. § 1119. Any veteran who, on or after August 2, 1990, performed active military, naval, air, or space service while assigned to a duty station in and/or airspace above Bahrain; Iraq; Kuwait; Oman; Qatar; Saudi Arabia; Somalia; the United Arab Emirates; the neutral zone between Iraq and Saudi Arabia; the Gulf of Aden; the Gulf of Oman; the Persian Gulf; the Arabian Sea; or the Red Sea will be presumed BPOT exposed. 

Here, the Veteran had active service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations from May 2012 through September 2012 and is thus considered a Persian Gulf veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 3.317(e). He is also a "covered veteran" with presumed BPOT exposure under 38 U.S.C. § 1119 during this period. 

Under 38 U.S.C. § 1120, chronic sinusitis and chronic rhinitis becoming manifest in a covered veteran shall be considered to have been incurred in or aggravated during active military, naval, air, or space service, notwithstanding that there is no record of evidence of such disease during the period of such service. 38 U.S.C. § 1120(a), (b). (Effective Aug. 10, 2022, P.L. 117-168, Title IV, § 406(b), 136 Stat. 1784.)

A Veteran who has a qualifying period of service shall be presumed to have been exposed to fine, particulate matter during such service, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the veteran was not exposed to fine, particulate matter during that service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(4). The term qualifying period of service includes any period of active military, naval, air, or space service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War. 38 C.F.R. § 3.320(a)(5). Certain chronic diseases will be service connected if manifested to any degree (including non-compensable) at any time following separation from a qualifying period of military service as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, including rhinitis and sinusitis, to include rhinosinusitis. 

1. Service connection for hypertension is granted.

The Veteran asserts that his hypertension is related to service, and that he took medication for hypertension during active duty. See his February 2022 claim and his reported history at the August 2022 VA examination. At the August 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported that his hypertension began after 2005, and said he noticed it himself after a routine examination when he reviewed his medical records. 

In cases where a veteran served continuously for 90 days or more during a period of active service and hypertension becomes manifest to a degree of 10 percent within one year from date of termination of such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309. This presumption is rebuttable by affirmative evidence to the contrary. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

The evidence reflects that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of hypertension. See August 2022 VA examination. Hypertension is an enumerated condition under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a); Walker, 708 F.3d 1331.

As noted above, the Veteran had a period of active service August 30, 2005 to November 30, 2005. 

Upon review of the record, the Board finds the evidence to at least be in approximate balance as to whether the Veteran's current hypertension manifested to a compensable degree within one year after separation from service on November 30, 2005. Post-service treatment records show that hypertension was diagnosed in February 2006, and required continuous medication for control. 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101. A February 2006 occupational health physical examination reflects a diagnosis of hypertension, treated with Lisinopril. Subsequent service treatment records reflect that the Veteran's hypertension continued to require continuous medication for control. See medical questionnaires dated in February 2006, March 2006 and May 2008, and February 2012 Air Force web-based health assessment results. Service treatment records consistently show that he was taking 10 milligrams (mg) of Lisinopril daily for hypertension. See June 2007, May 2008, January 2010, and January 2012 service treatment records.

As a chronic condition, any subsequent manifestations of hypertension are service-connected unless attributable to intercurrent causes. No intercurrent causes have been shown in this case and therefore the Veteran's hypertension is attributable to the period of active service from August 30, 2005 to November 30, 2005.

As the evidence is in approximate balance, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is applicable, and the claim for service connection for hypertension is granted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.309(a); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

2. Service connection for a low back disability is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that he incurred a lumbar spine disability during service, due to carrying heavy fire-fighting equipment. See his February 2022 claim and his reported history at the August 2022 VA examination. At the August 2022 VA examination, he said he was not sure when the condition began, but it was around 2012, and it had a gradual onset.

The evidence of record shows that the Veteran has worked as a firefighter for many years, including on a full-time basis during his civilian employment and during his periods of service in the USAFR and MS ANG. See his service personnel records, service treatment records dated in August 1997, May 1999, October 2000, September 2001, October 2002, and February 2012, and a March 2014 VA outpatient treatment record. In an October 2002 occupational/environmental history form, the Veteran reported that he had worked as a firefighter for the fire department since January 1993.

In this case, there is a question as to whether the Veteran's lumbosacral strain preexisted his period of active military service from April 1, 2012 to November 17, 2012.

The most competent and credible evidence of record illustrates that the Veteran's low back disability preexisted the periods of active service in 2005 and 2012. An October 2000 occupational health history questionnaire reflects that the Veteran reported a history of a back injury for which he missed work, and treatment for a pulled lower back. He related that he worked in fire protection. In a September 2001 occupational health history questionnaire, the Veteran reported that he missed work in February 2000 because of a work-related injury, he had frequent low back pain, and had been treated for back problems. He reported that he worked for the fire department. In an October 2002 medical history for his annual firefighter physical examination, the Veteran reported a history of recurrent back pain or back injury. He said he pulled his lower back. In an October 2002 occupational/ environmental history form, the Veteran reported that about four years ago, he was off work for six days for a pulled lower back, which was a work-related illness/injury. He said he frequently experienced pain and discomfort in his low back or had been under a doctor's care for back problems. In a December 2003 health history questionnaire, the Veteran reported that he had a pinched disc in his lumbar area, at L-3, and saw a chiropractor two or three times monthly.  In a March 2004 medical surveillance/ certification examination, the Veteran reported that he initially injured his back six years ago, and the condition was recurrent and work-related. In a March 2004 medical history, the Veteran reported current pain in his lower lumbar back, and said he had a pinched disc in his back. In a March 2006 medical questionnaire, the Veteran reported that he had a spinal or skeletal condition producing sensory or motor deficits, pain and/or nerve compression, which he identified as "sublamation" [sic].

The November 2022 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's lumbar strain condition clearly and unmistakable pre-existed the Veteran's 2012 deployment and was not aggravated by the same.  However, the examiner did not address aggravation of the Veteran's lumbar spine disability during the Veteran's 2005 period of service, or otherwise consider whether the condition was related to a disease or injury during a period of ADT or an injury during a period of IDT.  On remand, an addendum opinion is needed to address this pre-decisional error.   The Veterans duty status (IDT v. ADT) should also be ascertained on the days he reported back symptoms.

3. Service connection for sinusitis is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that his current sinusitis is related to his period of service in the Gulf War, and that it began after May 2012. See his February 2022 claim and his reported history at the August 2022 VA examination. He reported that after he returned from the Persian Gulf, he had frequent sinus infections with a runny nose and watery eyes.

While the Veteran is competent to report experiencing symptoms of sinus infections with a runny nose and watery eyes, the Board finds that his report that sinus symptoms began after May 2012 is not credible. The Veteran's current reports are internally inconsistent with his reports in contemporaneous treatment records. Service treatment records show that in a December 1992 report of medical history, the Veteran reported using Sinaid and said he did not know if he had sinusitis. He repeatedly reported a history of sinus problems. See hearing conservation examinations dated in August 1997, November 2000, and September 2001. In the latter two examinations, he also reported a history of allergies. He reported "recurrent sinusitis" in March 2006. See March 2006 medical questionnaire.  

In this case, there is a question as to whether the Veteran's sinusitis preexisted his period of active service from April 1, 2012 to November 17, 2012.

The issue of entitlement to sinusitis is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the January 2023 rating decision on appeal. The AOJ obtained VA medical opinions from a contract examiner in November 2022 and December 2022 prior to the rating decision on appeal. The contract examiner who provided both medical opinions opined that chronic sinusitis clearly and unmistakably existed prior to the period of service in 2012, and was clearly and unmistakably not aggravated beyond its natural progression by the 2012 deployment. However, the examiner did not provide an opinion regarding whether the Veteran's sinusitis existed prior to his period of IADT from February 22, 1989 to June 6, 1989, or whether it was aggravated by his 2005 service. 

In the November 2022 and December 2022 VA medical opinions, the examiner quoted from a January 12, 2012 private medical record from Progressive Physician's Practice, which noted that "The claimant reports being diagnosed with sinusitis. The condition has existed for 25 years. He described his sinus problems as being constant. During episodes, he is incapacitated as often as 2 times per year, lasting 4 days. He reports interference with breathing thorough the nose, purulent discharge w/ hoarseness and pain. The last time it was infected was Nov 2011." This private medical record is not on file. A remand is required to allow VA to obtain this record.

The January 2012 private medical record stated that the Veteran's sinusitis had existed for 25 years (i.e., since 1987, prior to his period of IDT in 1989). An addendum medical opinion must be obtained addressing this evidence.  The Veteran's duty status (ADT v. IDT) when he made sinus complaints should also be verified.

4. Service connection for a left knee disability is remanded.

The Veteran asserts that he incurred a left knee disability during his period of active service in Kuwait from May 2012 through September 2012, due to running and military training on uneven terrain. See his February 2022 claim and his reported history at the August 2022 VA examination.

Initial Matter - Clear and Unmistakable Error in Favorable Finding

Any finding favorable to the claimant made by either a VA adjudicator, as described in § 3.103(f)(4), or by the Board of Veterans' Appeals, as described in § 20.801(a) of this chapter, is binding on all subsequent AOJ and Board adjudicators, unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding. For purposes of this section, a finding means a conclusion either on a question of fact or on an application of law to facts made by an adjudicator concerning the issue(s) under review. 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c). "Clear and unmistakable" is defined in VA regulation as "obvious or manifest." See, e.g., 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.304(b), 3.306(b).

In the December 2022 rating decision on appeal, the AOJ made the following favorable finding: "The evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during your service. Your service treatment records show treatment of left knee on May 15, 1989."

This AOJ finding is clearly erroneous. Service treatment records reflect that the Veteran was treated for complaints of right knee pain (not left) on March 15, 1989 and March 17, 1989, during his period of IADT. Service treatment records are entirely negative for complaints, diagnosis, or treatment of a left knee disability, including on entrance medical examination in January 2012 prior to his period of active service from May 2012 through September 2012. Accordingly, the AOJ's finding in this regard was clearly erroneous, and the Board is not bound by it.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the December 2022 rating decision on appeal. The AOJ obtained an August 2022 VA examination and November 2022 VA medical opinion prior to the rating decision on appeal.  However, based on the AOJ's November 2022 request for an examination, the VA examiner only provided an opinion as to whether a preexisting left knee disability was aggravated by his period of active service in 2012, but did not provide an opinion as to whether the Veteran's left knee disability had its onset in service or is otherwise related to a period of active service.

Prior to the December 2022 rating decision on appeal, the Veteran identified relevant outstanding private treatment records. Specifically, in a March 2014 VA outpatient treatment record, the Veteran reported that he was treated for knee pain by Dr. B. in January 2013, and underwent a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) study of his knee which showed malalignment of the patella. He also reported this treatment at the August 2022 VA examination. A remand is required to allow VA to obtain these records.

The Board notes that the March 2014 VA outpatient treatment records are unclear as to which knee was treated. A nursing note reflects that the Veteran complained of right knee pain and patella malalignment, while another note dated the same day referenced left knee pain and malalignment. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Verify Veteran's duty status (ADT or IDT) for the following dates:

(a)	August 2, 1997 (history of sinus problems);

(b)	October 14, 2000 (notes a back injury)

(c)	November 18, 2000 (history of sinus problems);

(d)	September 8, 2001 (frequent back pain)

(e)	October 19, 2002 (pain or discomfort in back)

(f)	December 19, 2003 ("pinched disc" in lumbar area)

(g)	March 24, 2004 (pain and "pinched disc" in lower back)

(h)	March 4, 2006 (recurrent sinusitis and "sublamation" [sic] of spine) 

(i)	August 25, 2007 (back pain, rarely); and

(j)	March 19, 2008 (occasional back stiffness related to 1997 injury).

2. Attempt to obtain a copy of the January 12, 2012 private medical record from Progressive Physician's Practice, referenced in the November 2022 and December 2022 VA medical opinions regarding sinusitis, and associate this record with the claims file.

3. Ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for Dr. B., who treated him for a knee condition. See March 17, 2014 history and physical VA outpatient treatment note. Make two requests for the authorized records from Dr. B., unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.

4. After the requested action above has been completed, obtain an addendum medical opinion addressing the etiology of the Veteran's back disability. The claims file must be reviewed by the examiner.

(a) For diagnosed lumbosacral strain (see August 2022 VA examination), please opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability or nearly 50 percent probability) that such disorder:

(1)	had its onset during his period of active service from March 26, 1996 to August 10, 1996 or a verified period of ADT, to include as the result of a cumulative impact injury from his military duties;

(2)	is the result of a disease or injury incurred during a verified period of ADT, to include a cumulative impact injury from his military duties; or

(3)	is otherwise the result of an injury incurred during a verified period of IDT, to include a cumulative impact injury from his military duties?

(b)	Please opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability) that pre-existing lumbosacral strain:

(1)	was aggravated by the period of active service from August 30, 2005 to November 30, 2005, to include as a result of a cumulative impact injury from his military duties;

(2)	was aggravated by the period of active service from April 1, 2012 to November 17, 2012, to include as a result of a cumulative impact injury from his military duties?

A complete rationale should be provided for all opinions, citing to specific evidence of record and medical principles, as necessary.  If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).

5. Then obtain an addendum medical opinion from an appropriate clinician regarding the Veteran's sinusitis. The claims file must be reviewed by the examiner.

(a)	For diagnosed sinusitis (see private medical records from C.B., MD received on March 11, 2022, August 2022 VA examination report, and VA medical opinions dated in November 2022 and December 2022), please opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability or nearly 50 percent probability) that such disorder preexisted the Veteran's period of initial active duty training (IADT) from February 22, 1989 to June 6, 1989? 

In addressing this question, please review the claims file, including the January 12, 2012 private medical record (if obtained) from Progressive Physician's Practice (referenced by the VA examiner who provided the November and December 2022 medical opinions) that stated that the Veteran's sinusitis had existed for 25 years (i.e., since 1987, prior to his period of IADT).  The examiner is advised that the Board finds that the Veteran's recent report that his sinusitis symptoms began after May 2012 is not credible. Service treatment records show that in a December 1992 report of medical history, the Veteran reported using Sinaid and said he did not know if he had sinusitis. He repeatedly reported a history of sinus problems. See hearing conservation examinations dated in August 1997, November 2000, and September 2001. In the latter two examinations, he also reported a history of allergies. He reported "recurrent sinusitis" in March 2006. See March 2006 medical questionnaire.  

(i)	If yes, was sinusitis aggravated during the period of IADT in 1989?

(ii)	If no, did sinusitis at least as likely as not have its onset during a verified period of ADT;

(iii)	If no, is sinusitis as least as likely as not the result of a disease or injury incurred during a verified period of ADT; or

(iv)	If no, is sinusitis at least as likely as not otherwise the result of an injury incurred during a verified period of IDT?

(b)	Please opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability) that pre-existing sinusitis:

(i)	Was aggravated by the period of active service from March 26, 1996 to August 10, 1996? 

(ii)	Was aggravated by the period of active service from August 30, 2005 to November 30, 2005?

(iii)	Was aggravated by the period of active service from April 1, 2012 to November 17, 2012, including as a result of conceded exposures in the Southwest Asia theater of operations from May 1, 2012 to September 30, 2012?

A complete rationale should be provided for all opinions, citing to specific evidence of record and medical principles, as necessary.  If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).

5. After the requested action in paragraph 2 has been completed, obtain an addendum medical opinion addressing the etiology of the Veteran's left knee disability. The claims file must be reviewed by the examiner.

For diagnosed left knee pain with history of malalignment (see March 17, 2014 history and physical VA outpatient treatment note) and left knee strain (see August 2022 VA examination), please opine as to whether it is at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability) that such disorder had its onset in service or is otherwise related to his active duty service in 2012. In addressing this question, please assume as true the Veteran's reports that his left knee pain began during running and military training on uneven terrain during his period of active service in Kuwait from May 2012 through September 2012, and provide a discussion of whether a nexus between the current left knee disability and that period of service is "medically plausible." Otherwise, the opinion will be rendered inadequate.
