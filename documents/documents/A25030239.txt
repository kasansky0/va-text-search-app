DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) benefits and services under Chapter 31, Title 38, United States Code, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran did not complete an initial evaluation for purposes of determining his basic eligibility for VR&E benefits.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to VR&E benefits under Chapter 31 have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3101, 3102, 3106, 3107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.1, 21.35, 21.40, 21.50, 21.52, 21.53, 21.57, 21.184, 21.198, 21.362.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1993 to December 1997.

An April 2023 decision letter found the Veteran was not entitled to VR&E benefits and services. An April 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to VR&E services under Chapter 31

The purpose of VA's rehabilitation program is to provide for services and assistance necessary to enable veterans with service-connected disabilities to achieve independence in daily living and, to the extent possible, to become employable and to obtain and maintain suitable employment. 38 U.S.C. § 3101;38 C.F.R. § 21.70.

Generally, a veteran seeking Chapter 31 vocational rehabilitation training will initially be assigned a specific case status of "applicant," and if he or she attends the appointment for an initial evaluation, the case will progress to "evaluation and planning." 38 C.F.R. § 21.180. During the evaluation and planning stage, it is determined whether the veteran has an employment handicap and whether achievement of a vocational goal is feasible, and a plan is developed. 38 C.F.R. § 21.184.

A veteran is entitled to rehabilitation services under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 31 when he or she either (1) has a service-connected disability rated as 20 percent or more disabling and is determined to be in need of rehabilitation to overcome an employment handicap, or (2) has a service-connected disability rated as 10 percent disabling and is determined to be in need of rehabilitation to overcome a serious employment handicap. 38 U.S.C. § 3102; 38 C.F.R. § 21.40.

In each case in which a veteran has either an employment handicap or serious employment handicap, the VA must determine the reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational goal. 38 C.F.R. § 21.53 (a). A "vocational goal" is defined as gainful employment consistent with a veteran's abilities, aptitudes, and interests. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3101 (8), 3106(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.50, 21.53.

The veteran is responsible for satisfactory conduct and cooperation in developing and implementing a program of rehabilitative services under Chapter 31. 38 C.F.R. § 21.362(a). In particular, a veteran requesting or being provided services under Chapter 31 must cooperate with VA staff in carrying out the initial evaluation and developing a rehabilitation plan. 38 C.F.R. § 21.362(c). When a veteran's conduct or cooperation becomes unsatisfactory, services and assistance may be discontinued and assigned to "discontinued" status. 38 C.F.R. § 21.198(b)(2).

Relevant to this appeal, in February 2023, the Veteran submitted an application for VR&E benefits. 

A March 2023 VR&E letter informed the Veteran he was determined eligible to receive an initial evaluation for entitlement to Chapter 31 benefits. The letter scheduled an initial evaluation appointment with a VA Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) to determine if he met the criteria for entitlement to Chapter 31 benefits.

A March 2023 VR&E letter stated the Veteran contacted the VRC requesting to reschedule his VR&E initial appointment. The VRC agreed to reschedule, but stated the Veteran would first need to complete and submit the required forms and ONET assessment. The letter stated if the Veteran did not respond with the required 28-1902w, 28-0800, and ONET assessment within 10 days from the date of the letter, it would be assumed he no longer wanted VR&E services.

An April 2023 decision letter found the Veteran was not entitled to VR&E benefits and services because he did not meet the criteria for an employment handicap. The letter stated the Veteran did not appear for his rescheduled initial assessment. The letter stated he may reapply anytime in the future. 

The Veteran submitted an April 2023 NOD, arguing he missed his appointment because he incorrectly read the appointment time. 

The Board finds the evidence supports the April 2023 letter finding the Veteran was not entitled to VR&E benefits and services. As noted above, basic eligibility for VA vocational rehabilitation services requires an initial evaluation to determine whether a claimant needs rehabilitation to overcome an employment handicap and whether a vocational goal is feasible given the functional impairment due to a claimant's service-connected and non-service-connected disabilities. As the Veteran did not attend the initial evaluation offered by VR&E services, there was no way for the VRC to determine whether he was in need of VR&E benefits. 

The Board considered the Veteran's argument that he accidentally wrote down the wrong appointment time. Under AMA, the Board cannot remand an appeal based on evidence or argument received after the decision on appeal. While the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's circumstance, the VRC appropriately denied the Veteran's claim due to his failure to appear for the scheduled appointment. The missed appointment was already rescheduled once by the VRC. The Veteran failed to attend the scheduled initial evaluation for his prior 2020 Chapter 31 appeal. The Veteran was advised he could re-apply in the future.

The Board is bound by the law and is without authority even to grant benefits on an equitable basis. 38 U.S.C. §§ 503, 7104; Harvey v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 416, 425 (1994). The claim must be denied based on a lack of entitlement under the law. Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994).
