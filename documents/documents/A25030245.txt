DOCKET NO. 240416-433244
DATE: April 2, 2025

ISSUE

Whether the Veteran is competent to handle the disbursement of his Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) funds.

ORDER

The Veteran is not competent to manage the disbursement of VA funds; the April 2024 appeal is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A September 2023 VA Form 21-4138 from B.T., licensed social worker, indicated that the Veteran was in need of a fiduciary due to his lack of stable housing; misuse of VA funds to buy drugs and multiple hospitalizations in 1 year due to his inability to manage his need for oxygen.  B.T. stated that the Veteran had reported to VA staff that "he smokes several hundred dollars of cocaine at a time."  

2. A January 2024 VA Form 27-0820 (report of General Information) indicates that the Veteran was recently discharged from a VA hospital and needed assistance in getting back to an extended stay motel.  

3. A February 2024 VA Form 21-0820 indicates that the Veteran was not allowed back at the extended stay hotel and put on a do not rent list due to drug paraphernalia found in his motel room.  The Veteran was later readmitted to VA inpatient and a social worker was trying to assist him in placement at a facility. See February 2024 VA discharge summary; VA Form 27-0820.

4. In a March 2024 rating decision, the RO found that the Veteran was not competent to handle disbursement of VA benefits.

5. The Veteran lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs, including the disbursement of VA funds, without limitation.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The Veteran is not competent for the purpose of receiving direct payment of his VA benefits, and restoration of competency is not warranted. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5502; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.353.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from February to March 1979 and from May 1981 to June 1993.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal.  38?C.F.R. § 20.301.

Whether the Veteran is competent to handle the disbursement of his VA funds

The Veteran generally opposes the March 2024 decision which found that the Veteran was not competent to handle the disbursement of VA funds.  See April 2024 VA Form 10182.  He contends that someone is "out to get him," and wanted to be removed from the fiduciary program.  See January 2024 Va Form 27-0820. For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that the previous finding of incompetency was proper.

Under VA regulations, a mentally incompetent person is one who because of injury or disease lacks the mental capacity to contract or to manage his or her own affairs, including disbursement of funds without limitation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.353 (a). Rating agencies have sole authority to make official determinations of competency and incompetency for purposes of insurance (38 U.S.C. § 1922), and, subject to 38 C.F.R. § 13.56 of this chapter, disbursement of benefits. Such determinations are final and binding on field stations for these purposes. 38 C.F.R. § 3.353 (b); see also, 38 C.F.R. §§ 13.55, 13.56, 13.57 (outlining the regulations pertaining to direct payment and the appointment of fiduciaries).

Unless the medical evidence is clear, convincing and leaves no doubt as to the person's incompetency, the rating agency will make no determination of incompetency without a definite expression regarding the question by the responsible medical authorities. Determinations relative to incompetency should be based upon all evidence of record and there should be a consistent relationship between the percentage of disability, facts relating to commitment or hospitalization and the holding of incompetency. 38 C.F.R. § 3.353 (c).

Where reasonable doubt arises regarding a beneficiary's mental capacity to contract or to manage his or her own affairs, including the disbursement of funds without limitation, such doubt will be resolved in favor of competency. 38 C.F.R. § 3.353 (d); see also, 38 C.F.R. § 3.102 (reiterating VA's long-standing policy to resolve all doubt in favor of the Veteran).

VA treatment records indicate that the Veteran was hospitalized and reported a history of homelessness and living at an extended stay motel.  See March and April 2023 VA inpatient treatment notes.  There is also evidence that the Veteran had a drug addiction and tested positive for cocaine, but was not a candidate for inpatient rehabilitation.  See April and August 2023 VA inpatient treatment notes. 

A September 2023 VA Form 21-4138 from B.T., licensed social worker, indicated that the Veteran was in need of a fiduciary due to his lack of stable housing; misuse of VA funds to buy drugs and multiple hospitalizations in 1 year due to his inability to manage his need for oxygen.  B.T. stated that the Veteran had reported to VA staff that "he smokes several hundred dollars of cocaine at a time."  

In an October 2023 decision, the Regional Office (RO) proposed a finding of incompetency and informed the Veteran that he had 60 days to challenge the finding. The Veteran did not submit any new evidence.

In a December 2023 rating decision, the RO found that the Veteran was not competent to handle the disbursement of VA benefits. 

A January 2024 VA Form 27-0820 (report of General Information) indicates that the Veteran was recently discharged from a VA hospital and needed assistance in getting back to the extended stay motel.  

A February 2024 VA Form 21-0820 indicates that the Veteran was not allowed back at the extended stay hotel and put on a do not rent list due to drug paraphernalia found in his motel room.  The Veteran was later readmitted to VA inpatient and a social worker was trying to assist him in placement at a facility. See February 2024 VA discharge summary; VA Form 27-0820.

In March 2024, the RO confirmed the finding that the Veteran was incompetent to handle the disbursement of funds.

The Board has considered the Veteran's arguments to the effect that he is capable of managing his VA disbursements. Given, however, the social worker's experience and specialized training, the Board assigns more probative weight to the September 2023 VA Form 21-4138 opinion and subsequent VA treatment records and Reports of General Information, that were considered by the RO in its March 2024 decision.  There is evidence that the Veteran has not had stable housing for quite some time and has admitted as such when he confirmed his mailing address at an extended stay motel.  See April 2023 Inpatient Discharge Summary.  There is also evidence that the Veteran's lack of stable housing may be due to his admitted unmanaged drug addiction.  Prior to the rating decision on appeal, there is no evidence to the contrary that the RO's March 2024 finding of incompetency was improper.

Here, upon review of all the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran is not competent for the purpose of managing the disbursement of his VA benefits. In this case, the presumption of competency is rebutted by the most probative evidence which is the clear and convincing medical evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.353 (d); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. This evidence established that the Veteran is incapable of managing his finances. In reaching this conclusion, the Board finds that the clear and convincing evidence leaves no doubt to be resolved in this matter.
