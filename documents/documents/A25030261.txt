REMANDED

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for residuals of status post umbilical ventral hernia repair is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from May 2004 to October 2016. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an April 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). 

The Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) in April 2024. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202. On that form, the Veteran indicated disagreement with the September 2018 decision which granted service connection for residuals of a hernia surgery; this would be untimely. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203. The Board has read the filing liberally, however, and accepted the NOD as being to the most recently issued decision, from the day prior in April 2024, which considered an August 2023 claim for increased rating. Moreover, the Veteran contacted VA by phone at the end of April and clarified the issue she wished to appeal.  The Veteran selected the Direct docket; therefore, the Board may only review evidence at the time of the April 2024 decision. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. 

Evidence was added to the claims file during a period of time when new evidence was not allowed. Specifically, the Veteran submitted lay statements regarding the severity of her condition and the Veteran underwent a hernia examination in August 2024. However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

In August 2023, the Veteran filed an increased rating claim for her status-post hernia repair. In December 2023 and January 2024 rating decisions, the issue of evaluation of residuals of hernia repair was deferred; both decisions indicated that examinations were requested and pending. 

A February 26, 2024, VA record shows an examination request was entered by the AOJ for evaluation of hernias and residuals.

A February 27, 2024, letter advised the Veteran that an examination was being requested and she was told she would be contacted with additional information regarding when and where to appear.  That examination request was noted to be cancelled in March 2024 for a failure to respond (RSVP) to attempts to schedule.   

However, the file reflects no documented scheduling of an examination, and the Veteran stated that a hernia examination had not been scheduled in her April 2024 NOD.

While it is generally presumed that VA policies and procedures are followed under the presumption of regularity, a Veteran may rebut the presumption by clear evidence to the contrary. Miley v. Principi, 366 F.3d, 1346-47 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("The presumption of regularity provides that, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, the court will presume that public officers have properly discharged their official duties."); Rizzo v. Shinseki, 580 F.3d 1288, 1292 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (applying the presumption of regularity to VA examination). Here, the Veteran has asserted no examination was scheduled.  The evidence of record appears to support that; the request was entered, but the examination was not scheduled because the Veteran did not "RSVP."  This is contrary to the expected regular process, which the Veteran was informed of in February 2024.  She was to be scheduled, and only then needed to respond if she needed to reschedule. 

Given the contrary instructions and guidance the Veteran appears to have received, and the fact that she has reported for numerus other examinations during this claims process, she cannot be said to have failed to report for an examination, and the failure to actually schedule an examination is a failure of the duty to assist the Veteran in substantiating her claim. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA Hernias examination to determine all current residuals of her service-connected umbilical ventral hernia repair, and to fully describe their severity and frequency.  The Veteran's lay statements and contentions regarding such residuals must be addressed. The AOJ may consider if an August 2024 VA examination adequately addresses this remand directive; if it finds it does, such must be certified in writing.
