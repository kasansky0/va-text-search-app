REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the United States Navy from January 1991 to April 1991, from March 2003 to July 2003 and from October 2005 to October 2009. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a December 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). See December 2023 rating decision.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Withdrawal 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. Id. 

In a March 2025 Correspondence, the Veteran withdrew the appeal before the Board. See VA 27-0820 Report of General Information. The Veteran contacted the VA and reported that "she would like to withdraw the 10182 that was put in on 8/22/2024. The Veteran put that in error." Id. 

An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.205, 19.55. In the present case, the appellant has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.
