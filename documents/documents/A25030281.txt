DOCKET NO. 210831-182401
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issues of an earlier effective date for total disability based on individual unemployability (TDIU) and an earlier effective date for basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On February 6, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received notification from the Veteran, through her authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the authorized representative have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active military service from January 1992 to July 2000.

In the August 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. 

On February 6, 2025, the Veteran's representative requested this appeal be removed from the Board's docket.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  

In the present case, the Veteran, through her authorized representative, has withdrawn this appeal. The February 6, 2025, written withdrawal included the Veteran's name, file number, and specific docket number captioned above. Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
