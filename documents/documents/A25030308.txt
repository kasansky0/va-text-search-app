REMANDED

Waiver of overpayment of educational assistance benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 33 (Post-9/11 GI Bill), to include the validity of the debt, in the amount of $1,350.00, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from January 2009 to June 2016. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an administrative decision issued in February 2021 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA). In March 2021, the Veteran timely appealed such rating decision to the Board by submitting a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (VA Form 10182) in which she elected the evidence submission lane. Consequently, the Board's review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the issuance of the administrative decision on February 22, 2021, and any evidence submitted within 90 days of the receipt of her Notice of Disagreement on March 17, 2021. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.

Waiver of overpayment of educational assistance benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, to include the validity of the debt, in the amount of $1,350.00.

Although the Board regrets the additional delay, a remand is necessary to ensure that due process is followed and that there is a complete record upon which to decide the Veteran's claim so that she is afforded every possible consideration. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.159.

As an initial matter, in her VA Form 10182, the Veteran stated she was appealing a February 22, 2021 administrative decision. However, there is no document by that date contained in the file. Thus, the Board is unclear of the correct amount of the  debt, although a November 2022 Appellant's Brief notes the amount is $1,350.00 as listed in July 2020, August 2020, September 2020, and February 2021 letters from the VA's Debt Management Center (DMC). However, the Board notes that all four letters mailed from the DMC before the filing of her VA Form 10182 were addressed and mailed to Ashland University.

Therefore, after a review of the file, the Board is unable to determine how the $1,350.00 debt was calculated, and whether a debt is owed by the Veteran or in fact, is owed by Ashland University. Thus, the Board cannot properly adjudicate the appeal as the RO did not provide an accounting of the total overpayment debt and it is unclear how the RO arrived at the total overpayment debt amount based on the evidence of record, and further, whether the Veteran owes any portion of the overpayment.

Therefore, a remand is warranted to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error and determine the actual amount of the debt, whether such debt is valid, and whether it is the Veteran or the school that is indebted.

As noted above, the DMC letters were mailed to Ashland University. Further, the Board notes that her file contains several returned mail pieces, dated about a year before the filing of her VA Form 10182, suggesting the Veteran had an address change and may not have been received the notices of a debt. Moreover, the most recent DMC letter is dated February 17, 2021, and the Veteran's statement stating she did not know she could request a waiver and subsequent request was received by VA on March 9, 2021, well within the 180-day period after the February 2021 letter. Therefore, the Board finds such request for a waiver for any existing outstanding debt that may belong to the Veteran to be timely.

Therefore, after the above ordered development, if the Veteran is found to have a valid debt, the Board finds that the issue of entitlement to a waiver of recovery of overpayment of education benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill must be remanded as well for adjudication on the merits in the first instance by the Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC). See 38 C.F.R. § 1.963.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Identify and associate the February 22, 2021 decision on appeal with the file.

2. Create a clear accounting as to how the total overpayment debt of Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits was calculated. Then, provide a detailed, yet straightforward accounting that shows how the total overpayment debt was calculated. The AOJ must associate such an accounting with the claims file and provide a copy to the Veteran.

3. If it is determined that a debt was validly created, determine if the debt is owed by the Veteran or by Ashland University.

4. If it is determined that the debt is owed by the Veteran, forward the Veteran's claims file to the COWC for adjudication of her timely request for a waiver of recovery on an overpayment in the first instance.
