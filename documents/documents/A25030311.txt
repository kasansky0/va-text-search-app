DOCKET NO. 250305-522131
DATE: April 1, 2025

ORDER

During the entire increased rating period on appeal, from February 11, 2020 forward, an increased disability rating of 70 percent, and no higher, for the service connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

An earlier effective date of October 1, 2020, for a total disability rating for compensation purposes based on individual unemployability due to service connected disabilities (TDIU) is granted.

An earlier effective date of October 1, 2020, for basic eligibility for dependents educational assistance (DEA) benefits under 38 U.S.C., Chapter 35, is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. During the entire increased rating period on appeal, from February 11, 2020, the severity, frequency, and duration of the symptoms of the service connected PTSD more nearly approximated occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.

2. From October 1, 2020, the Veteran was unable to maintain substantially gainful employment as a result of service connected disabilities.

3. From October 1, 2020, the Veteran had a total disability rating (represented by a TDIU) that was permanent in nature due to service connected disabilities.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, from February 11, 2020 forward, the criteria for an increased disability rating of 70 percent for the service connected PTSD, but no higher, have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5103, 5103A, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.159, 3.321, 3.326(a), 4.3, 4.7, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

2. The criteria for an earlier effective date of October 1, 2020 for a TDIU have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.156(b), 3.340, 3.341, 3.400, 4.15, 4.16, 4.18, 4.19, 4.25.

3. The criteria for an earlier effective date of October 1, 2020 for DEA benefits have been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510, 5113; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807(a), 21.3021.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran, who is the appellant, had active service from April 1967 to April 1970.

The Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-55 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 38 U.S.C.), 131 Stat. 1105 (2017), also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), creates a new framework of review for appellants disagreeing with the Agency of Original Jurisdiction's (AOJ) decision on a claim.

Following March 2024 and September 2024 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) rating decisions, the Veteran submitted a March 2025 VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD), appealing the decisions.  The NOD requested direct review by the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board).  Direct review is the appeal option to the Board in which a Board decision is issued based on evidence of record at the time of the prior decision.  The Board cannot hold a hearing or accept into the record additional evidence in its direct review.

Notably, this appeal has been advanced on the docket due to the Veteran's advanced age.  In Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that, generally, the Board should not decide an appeal before the deadline for requesting an AMA docket switch has elapsed.  The reasoning was that 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) allows appellants to switch AMA dockets by completing and submitting a new VA Form 10182 within 60 days from when the Board receives the original VA Form 10182, or one year from the date the AOJ mails notice of the decision on appeal, whichever is later, unless (1) an appellant has already submitted evidence or testimony as described in 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302 and 20.303, or (2) the appellant or representative has requested a waiver of the ability to request to switch dockets during this timeframe.  In this case, 60 days following the receipt of the March 2025 VA Form 10182 has not yet lapsed, and one year has not elapsed from the date of the September 2024 rating decision on appeal. 

Nonetheless, it appears that the Veteran and representative wish to receive a decision in this matter as soon as possible, and neither the Veteran nor the representative has suggested otherwise.  When the Veteran's attorney filed the March 2025 NOD, he submitted an argument brief in support of the appeal, which includes all relevant arguments for increasing the PTSD disability rating and assigning earlier effective dates for a TDIU and DEA benefits.  The Board has relied on these arguments to grant an increased PTSD rating and earlier effective dates for the TDIU and DEA benefits in the instant decision.  Further, the March 2025 argument brief explicitly stated that the representative and Veteran looked forward to the Board's decision, indicating that they wished for the Board to issue a decision at this time, and implicitly waiving any request for a docket switch.

Further, in weighing the benefits and risks of further delaying the case to afford the Veteran notice of the opportunity to switch dockets, the Board concludes that in light of the Veteran's advanced age, it is not in the Veteran's best interest to further delay this matter, particularly in light of the Board's findings that an increased disability rating for the PTSD and earlier effective dates for the TDIU and DEA benefits from the day following the Veteran's last day of substantially gainful employment are warranted.

1. An Increased Disability Rating of 70 Percent for PTSD from February 11, 2020 is Granted.

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.  Total disability is considered to exist when there is any impairment which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  Total disability may or may not be permanent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a)(1).  Total ratings are authorized for any disability or combination of disabilities for which the Rating Schedule prescribes a 100 percent evaluation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a)(2).

Where there is a question as to which of two disability ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  It is the defined and consistently applied policy of VA to administer the law under a broad interpretation, consistent, however, with the facts shown in every case.  When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

Where an increase in an existing disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary concern.  Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994).  The relevant temporal focus for adjudicating an increased rating claim is on the evidence concerning the state of the disability from the time period one year before the claim was filed until VA makes a final decision on the claim.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

A veteran is competent to report symptoms because this requires only personal knowledge, not medical expertise, as it comes to him through his senses.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 470 (1994).  Lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of observable symptomatology, where the determination is not medical in nature and is capable of lay observation.  Barr, 21 Vet. App. 303.

Under Diagnostic Code 9411, a 10 percent rating will be assigned for a mental disability which is productive of occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress, or symptoms controlled by continuous medication.  A 30 percent rating will be assigned for occupational and social impairment which is productive of occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as depressed mood; anxiety; suspiciousness; panic attacks (weekly or less often); chronic sleep impairment; and mild memory loss (such as forgetting manes, directions, recent events).  A 50 percent rating will be assigned for occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to symptoms such as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks occurring more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short- and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material or forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.  A 70 percent rating will be assigned for occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood due to symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work like setting); and an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  A 100 percent rating will be assigned for total occupational and social impairment due to symptoms such as gross impairment in thought processes or communication, persistent delusions or hallucinations, grossly inappropriate behavior, a persistent danger of hurting herself or others, an intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene), disorientation to time or place, and memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

The Secretary of VA, acting within the authority to adopt and apply a schedule of ratings, chose to create one general rating formula for mental disorders.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; see 38 U.S.C. § 501; 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.  By establishing one general formula to be used in rating more than 30 psychiatric disorders, there can be no doubt that the Secretary of VA anticipated that any list of symptoms justifying a particular rating would in many situations be either under- or over inclusive.  The Secretary's use of the phrase "such symptoms as," followed by a list of examples, provides guidance as to the severity of symptoms contemplated for each rating, in addition to permitting consideration of other symptoms, particular to each veteran and disorder, and the effect of those symptoms on the claimant's social and work situation.  This construction is not inconsistent with Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).  See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (1992).

The evidence considered in determining the level of impairment under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 is not restricted to the symptoms provided in the diagnostic code.  Instead, the rating specialist is to consider all symptoms of a claimant's condition that affect the level of occupational and social impairment, including, if applicable, those identified in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V).  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.126.  If the evidence demonstrates that a claimant suffers symptoms or effects that cause occupational or social impairment equivalent to what would be caused by the symptoms listed in the diagnostic code, the appropriate, equivalent rating will be assigned.  The schedular rating criteria rate by analogy psychiatric symptoms that are "like or similar to" those explicitly listed in the schedular rating criteria.  Mauerhan, 16 Vet. App. at 443.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has embraced the Mauerhan interpretation of the criteria for rating psychiatric disabilities.  Sellers v. Principi, 372 F.3d 1318, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  

In Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 117 (2013), the Federal Circuit held that VA "intended the General Rating Formula to provide a regulatory framework for placing veterans on a disability spectrum based upon their objectively observable symptoms."  The Federal Circuit stated that "a veteran may only qualify for a given disability rating under § 4.130 by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration."  It was further noted that "§ 4.130 requires not only the presence of certain symptoms but also that those symptoms have caused occupational and social impairment in most of the referenced areas."  See also Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10 (2017) (indicating that the Board should consider the severity, frequency, and duration of the signs and symptoms of a mental disorder when determining the appropriate rating).

At the outset the Board will review the AMA rating period on appeal.  Review of the record reflects that in November 2019 VA received the Veteran's claim to reopen service connection for prostate cancer.  Subsequently, on February 11, 2020, VA received an Intent to File a Claim for Compensation form.  Then, in March 2020, the AOJ issued a rating decision again denying service connection for prostate cancer.

In May 2020, VA received a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, requesting review of the March 2020 rating decision denying service connection for prostate cancer.  As this was a continuation of the November 2019 claim to reopen service connection for prostate cancer, the February 11, 2020 Intent to File could not have been referring to the subsequent May 2020 supplemental claim request.  Rather, on February 11, 2021, exactly one year after VA's receipt of the Intent to File, VA received a VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, requesting an increased disability rating for the service-connected PTSD.  The Board finds this to be the claim relevant to the February 11, 2020 Intent to File.

Based upon the above procedural history, the Board finds the AMA increased rating period to run from February 11, 2020, the date of receipt of Intent to File.

Per a March 2025 argument brief, the Veteran's representative argues that at least a 70 percent disability rating for the service-connected PTSD is warranted from February 11, 2020.  Currently the PTSD is rated 50 percent disabling from February 11, 2021, with a 10 percent disability rating prior to that date; however, the Board notes that in the prior rating decision on appeal the AOJ should have awarded the 50 percent increased rating from February 11, 2020, but did not recognize that the PTSD rating period stemmed from the February 11, 2020 Intent to File.

Having reviewed the evidence of record, lay and medical, the Board finds the evidence of record at least in relative equipoise on the question of whether, for the rating period from February 11, 2020, the severity, frequency, and duration of the symptoms of the service connected PTSD more nearly approximated occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, to warrant a 70 percent disability rating.

The Veteran received a VA PTSD examination in July 2021.  While most of the reported symptoms were associated with the 30 percent rating criteria, the Veteran was diagnosed has having difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a worklike setting, which is contemplated by the 70 percent rating criteria.

A lay statement from the Veteran's spouse was received in July 2022.  Relevant to the question of entitlement to a 70 percent disability rating, the spouse explained that the Veteran often physically strikes/attacks individuals who approach from behind.  Such behavior is like or similar to impaired impulse control, such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence, as contemplated by the 70 percent rating criteria.  Further, the spouse described a number of behaviors from the Veteran when in public that are consistent with the VA examiner's finding of a difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a worklike setting.

VA also received two lay statements from the Veteran in July 2022.  Per the first lay statement, the Veteran conveyed lashing out at others and having clashes with work supervisors.  In the second July 2022 lay statement, the Veteran again advanced getting into altercations with both regular individuals and co workers/managers.  Again, such actions are consistent with a finding of difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a worklike setting.  

A new VA examination was performed in August 2022.  In discussing legal and behavioral history, it was noted that the Veteran had been fired after striking a co worker who had triggered the Veteran's PTSD.  Upon reviewing the PTSD diagnostic criterion, it was reported that the PTSD manifested as irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provocation) typically expressed as verbal or physical aggression toward people or objects.  Such symptom is like or similar to unprovoked irritability with periods of violence, as contemplated by the 70 percent rating criteria.  Further, upon examination the Veteran was again found to have difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a worklike setting.

In November 2022 the Veteran's employer contacted VA to discuss the Veteran's behavior.  Per the Report of General Information, the employer informed that individuals would have to be advised not to come up from behind the Veteran, as sometimes the Veteran's "first reaction is to start swinging."  This evidence is consistent with both a finding of unprovoked irritability with periods of violence and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a worklike setting.

At a February 2024 Higher-Level Review informal conference, the Veteran's representative argued that the Veteran's history of striking a co-worker by itself was sufficient to warrant a finding of occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.  This argument was essentially raised again in the March 2025 argument brief.  

While the record reflects that the majority of the Veteran's mental symptoms are contemplated by the 30 and 50 percent rating criteria, during the increased rating period on appeal, beginning February 11, 2020, the evidence shows that the Veteran displayed symptoms of both unprovoked irritability with periods of violence and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a worklike setting; symptoms which are contemplated by the 70 percent rating criteria.  Having reviewed the evidence of record, lay and medical, the Board finds the evidence at least in relative equipoise on the question of whether these symptoms were of such severity, frequency, and/or duration to more nearly approximated occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas.

For these reasons, resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the lay and medical evidence shows that an increased disability rating of 70 percent is warranted for the service connected PTSD from February 11, 2020 forward, the date of claim for increased rating.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.  As the evidence of record does not reflect that the Veteran first became entitled to the 70 percent disability rating during the one-year lookback period from February 11, 2019 through February 11, 2020, this is the earliest effective date available at law for the increased rating to 70 percent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o).

The Board has also considered whether a 100 percent (total) disability rating was warranted for the service-connected PTSD at any point during the increased rating period on appeal.  Having reviewed the evidence of record, lay and medical, the Board does not find that the severity, frequency, and duration of the symptoms of the service connected PTSD manifested as total occupational and social impairment at any time during the rating period from February 11, 2020.

At the time of the July 2021 VA PTSD examination, it was reported that the Veteran got along well with his family and that he had one close friend and various associates.  Further, at the time of the August 2022 VA PTSD examination, the Veteran conveyed having a good relationship with his wife and family.  Such evidence persuasively weighs against a finding of total social impairment.

Further, as will be discussed in further detail below, while the Veteran's PTSD symptoms prevented, in part, working substantially gainful employment, during at least part of the rating period on appeal the Veteran worked non-substantially gainful/marginal employment.  While the employment may have been marginal in nature, and thus warranting the grant of a TDIU, such evidence persuasively weighs against a finding of total occupational impairment.

For these reasons, the Board finds an increased disability rating in excess of 70 percent is not warranted at any point during the increased rating period on appeal, from February 11, 2020 forward.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.3, 4.7, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

Extraschedular Claim Not Raised

The Board finds that neither the Veteran nor the record has raised a claim for extraschedular rating under 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b) for any period for the increased rating issue on appeal.  See Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111 (2008); Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record); Yancy v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 484, 494 (2016), citing Dingess v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 473, 499 (2006), aff'd, 226 Fed. Appx. 1004 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that when 38 C.F.R. § 3.321(b)(1) is not "specifically sought by the claimant nor reasonably raised by the facts found by the Board, the Board is not required to discuss whether referral is warranted").

2. TDIU from October 1, 2020 is Granted.

The effective date for an increased rating for disability compensation will be the date entitlement arose or the date of receipt of the claim, whichever is later, with the exception being that the date may be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred if a claim is received within one year from such date.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  A TDIU claim is a claim for increased compensation, and the effective date rules for increased compensation apply to a TDIU claim.  See Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000).

The Court has held that a TDIU is raised when a veteran: (1) submits evidence of a medical disability; (2) makes a claim for the highest rating possible; and 

(3) submits evidence of unemployability.  See Roberson v. Principi, 251 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2001); Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  Total disability is considered to exist when there is any impairment which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation.  Total disability may or may not be permanent.  38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a)(1).  Total ratings are authorized for any disability or combination of disabilities for which the Rating Schedule prescribes a 100 percent evaluation.  38 C.F.R. § 3.340(a)(2).

TDIU may be assigned when the disabled person is, in the judgment of the rating agency, unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities.  The service-connected disabilities, employment history, educational and vocational attainment, and all other factors having a bearing on the issue will be addressed in both instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), (b).

If there is only one such disability, it must be rated at 60 percent or more; if there are two or more disabilities, at least one disability must be rated at 40 percent or more, with sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  If a veteran's disabilities do not meet the objective combined rating percentage criteria of 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a), it then becomes necessary to consider whether the criteria for referral for extraschedular consideration are met under § 4.16(b) criteria.  It is the established policy of VA that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled.  Submission to the Director, Compensation and Pension Service, for extraschedular consideration is warranted in all cases of veterans who are unemployable by reason of service-connected disabilities, but who fail to meet the percentage standards set forth in § 4.16(a).  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(b).

Individual unemployability must be determined without regard to any non-service-connected disabilities or a veteran's advancing age.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341(a), 4.19; Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993).  The sole fact that a veteran is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough.  A high rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain or keep employment, but the ultimate question is whether a veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether a veteran can find employment.  Id. at 361.  When reasonable doubt arises as to the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in a veteran's favor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

In Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342 (2000), the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) defined "substantially gainful employment" as an occupation that provides an annual income that exceeds the poverty threshold for one person, irrespective of the number of hours or days that a veteran actually works and without regard to a veteran's earned annual income.  In Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993), the Court held that the central inquiry in determining whether a veteran is entitled to a TDIU is whether a veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability. The determination as to whether a total disability is appropriate should not be based solely upon demonstrated difficulty in obtaining employment in one particular field, which could also potentially be due to external bases such as economic factors, but rather to all reasonably available sources of employment under the circumstances.  See Ferraro v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 326, 331-332 (1991).  

In Ray v. Wilkie, the Court explained that substantially gainful employment contains economic and noneconomic components.  The noneconomic component requires consideration of a veteran's ability to secure or follow that type of employment.  Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).  In evaluating a veteran's employability, consideration may be given to the level of education, special training, and previous work experience in arriving at a conclusion, but not to age or impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

The economic component involves considerations around marginal employment.  Ray, 31 Vet. App. at 73.  Marginal employment is not considered substantially gainful employment and generally is deemed to exist when a veteran's earned income does not exceed the amount established by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as the poverty threshold for one person.  Marginal employment may also be held to exist in certain cases when earned annual income exceeds the poverty threshold on a facts-found basis.  Consideration shall be given in all claims to the nature of the employment and the reason for termination.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  Marginal employment, odd-job employment, and employment at half the usual remuneration is not incompatible with a determination of unemployability if the restriction to securing or retaining better employment is due to disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.17(a).

The term "protected environment" has not been specifically defined by VA.  Until recently, it had not been defined by the courts that review VA decisions.  Most recently, the Court addressed the meaning of the phrase "employment in a protected environment" in 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  In LaBruzza v. McDonough, the Court defined a "protected environment" as a "lower-income position that, due to the veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, is shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market."  The Court stated that while the Board may consider ADA accommodations and other individualized factors, such as income, neither are dispositive.  LaBruzza v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 111, 123-24 (2024).  The Court indicated that a protected work environment was one where the earned income was above the marginal employment level, but not too far above it, and that it is a very fact specific inquiry.  Id.

The ultimate issue of whether a TDIU should be awarded is not a medical question, but rather is a determination for the adjudicator.  See Moore v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 211, 218 (2007) (ultimate question of whether a veteran is capable of substantial gainful employment is not a medical one; that determination is for the VA adjudicator), rev'd on other grounds sub nom, Moore v. Shinseki, 555 F.3d 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2009).  Although VA must give full consideration, per 38 C.F.R. § 4.15, to "the effect of combinations of disability," VA regulations place responsibility for the ultimate TDIU determination on VA, not a medical examiner's opinion.  See Geib v. Shinseki, 733 F.3d 1350, 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2013); 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a); see also Smith v. Shinseki, 647 F.3d 1380, 1385-86 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (VA is not required to obtain an industrial survey from a vocational expert before making a TDIU determination but may choose to do so in an appropriate case).

The Veteran appeals for an effective date earlier than February 11, 2021 for the grant of TDIU.

At the outset the Board will address the TDIU rating period on appeal.  As the TDIU issue in this case attaches to the PTSD rating issue pursuant to Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009), for the reasons discussed in the PTSD rating section above, the TDIU rating period could run as far back as the February 11, 2020 Intent to File (with consideration of the one-year lookback period).

In the most recent March 2025 argument brief, the Veteran's representative argues that a TDIU should go back to February 11, 2020, along with the grant of a 70 percent disability rating for PTSD; however, the Board notes that such argument contradicts earlier lay statements and evidence provided by both the Veteran and representative.  Specifically, in the July 2022 VA Form 21-8940, Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, the Veteran explicitly conveyed last working full-time in September 2020, and that the service-connected disabilities first affected full-time employment in September 2020.

In the employment status section of the TDIU claim form, the Veteran explained that from February 2020 to September 2020 he worked for two companies, Zamma Corporation as a knife grinder and Piedmont Communications in custodial.  The Veteran worked for Zamma Corporation for 22-to-40 hours per week, with gross earnings of up to $2,250 per month.  Such employment paid above the poverty threshold even before considering the extra money the Veteran earned working an additional two hours per week at Piedmont Communications, and no evidence or argument was received consistent with a finding that the Veteran's employment at Zamma Corporation was marginal in nature.    

Further, the Board does not find that the Veteran's employment prior to October 2020 was in a protected environment pursuant to LaBruzza.  The evidence is not consistent with a finding that the Veteran's work at Zamma Corporation was a lower-income position that, due to the Veteran's service-connected disability or disabilities, was shielded in some respect from competition in the employment market.  To the contrary, in an earlier December 2023 argument brief from the Veteran's representative, the Veteran's representative requested that a TDIU be granted "effective October 1, 2020, the day after his last month of substantially gainful work."  In other words, during the course of this appeal, both the Veteran and the representative have conveyed that the Veteran was substantially gainfully employed until the end of September 2020 when the Veteran left employment with Zamma Corporation.

Finally, the Board notes that, following leaving Zamma Corporation, the Veteran continued to work at Piedmont Communications for two hours per week, making approximately $150 per month.  In the September 2024 rating decision granting a TDIU from February 11, 2021, the AOJ made a favorable finding that such employment was marginal in nature.  Under the AMA the Board is bound by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 20.801.  

Based upon the above, the Board finds that the TDIU rating period before it runs from October 1, 2020, the day following the Veteran's last day of substantially gainful employment, through February 10, 2021, day prior to the AOJ's grant of a TDIU from February 11, 2021.  Based upon the Board's actions in the instant decision, from October 1, 2020, the service-connected disabilities met the combined rating percentage requirements for a TDIU pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) (also referred to as a "schedular" TDIU).

In September 2024, the AOJ issued a rating decision granting entitlement to a TDIU from February 11, 2021, based upon the Veteran's service-connected osteoarthritis of the right hip, PTSD, and gunshot wound residuals.  An effective date of February 11, 2021 was assigned, as this was found to be the date upon which the Veteran met the schedular rating criteria pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  Again, the Board is bound by these favorable findings under the AMA.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 20.801.  Presumably, had the Veteran met the schedular rating criteria for a TDIU pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a) prior to February 11, 2021, a TDIU would have been awarded from an earlier date.  

In the instant decision the Board finds that the PTSD symptoms upon which the AOJ's TDIU grant was based, in part, have been present since February 11, 2020.  Further, a review of the record reflects that the other service-connected disability symptoms, including the right hip symptoms and various gunshot wound residuals, have been present since February 11, 2020; therefore, based upon the AOJ's favorable finding that such symptoms warranted the grant of a TDIU from February 11, 2021, the Board must find that the Veteran is entitled to a TDIU from October 1, 2020, the day following the Veteran's last day of substantially gainful employment.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.104(c), 20.801.

Considering the above, the Board finds the evidence at least in relative equipoise as to whether an earlier effective date of October 1, 2020 (day following the Veteran's last day of substantially gainful employment) is warranted for the grant of a TDIU; therefore, resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds entitlement to an earlier effective date of October 1, 2020 for the grant of a TDIU to be warranted.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781-82.

3. DEA Benefits from October 1, 2020 are Granted.

In this case, based upon the actions taken by the Board above, the Board finds that the criteria for the award of Chapter 35 education benefits are met from October 1, 2020.  For the purposes of educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35, the child or surviving spouse of a veteran will have basic eligibility if the following conditions are met: (1) The veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in service; and (2) the veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability; or (3) a permanent total service-connected disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death; or (4) the veteran died as a result of a service connected disability.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807(a), 21.3021.

Per a September 2024 rating decision, basic eligibility for Chapter 35 education benefits was established effective from February 11, 2021.  The grant of basic eligibility for Chapter 35 education benefits was based on the grant of a TDIU effective February 11, 2021, and a specific finding that the Veteran had a total service connected disability (represented by the TDIU) that was permanent in nature due to the service-connected disabilities.  For reasons explained above, in the instant decision the Board has granted an earlier effective date for the grant of the TDIU.  Specifically, a TDIU has been awarded for the period from October 1, 2020.

The evidence reflects that the Veteran has a permanent total disability from October 1, 2020, the effective date of the award of TDIU; therefore, the criteria are met for Chapter 35 education benefits for the period beginning October 1, 2020.  

38 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807(a), 21.3021.  VA regulations do not provide for an effective date earlier than the date of the award of TDIU (October 1, 2020).
