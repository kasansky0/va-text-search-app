ORDER

The appeal for the issue of entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

1.  The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182 on April 27, 2023, in which he identified the issue as entitlement to service connection for tinnitus based on an April 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision date.  The Veteran had been notified of that decision on April 26, 2022.

2.  The Veteran and his representative have not submitted a request for an extension of the time limit to submit a VA Form 10182, and good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board to extend the time for filing a VA Form 10182.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The appeal is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104, 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.4, 20.104, 20.201, 20.202, 20.203.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1998 to May 2006.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from the filing of an April 2023 VA Form 10182.

Law and Analysis

The Board has jurisdiction to make decisions in appeals on all questions of law and fact necessary to a decision by the Secretary of VA under a law that affects the provision of VA benefits. 38 C.F.R. § 20.104.  An appeal consists of a notice of disagreement timely filed to the Board on any issue for which VA provided notice of a decision under 38 U.S.C. § 5104 affecting the provision of VA benefits. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.4, 20.202, 20.203; see also 38 U.S.C. § 511.  The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific determination with which the claimant disagrees. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

Under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), a notice of disagreement must be properly completed on a form prescribed by the Secretary, which in this case is the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.202.  In terms of the time limit for filing a VA Form 10182, a claimant or his representative must file a properly completed VA Form 10182 with a decision by the AOJ within one year from the date the AOJ mails the notice of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(b).  Under 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(c), a claimant or his representative can file a request in writing to the Board for an extension of the period for filing a VA Form 10182.  The Board will then determine if good cause for an extension of time has been established. 38 C.F.R. § 20.203(c).

In this case, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) for service connection for tinnitus in October 2021, which was denied in a December 2021 rating decision.  In April 2022, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 request for higher-level review of the December 2021 rating decision.  On April 25, 2022, the AOJ issued the higher-level review rating decision, and the Veteran and his representative were notified of that decision on April 26, 2022.

On April 27, 2023, the VA received the Veteran's VA Form 10182, which was also signed on April 27, 2023.  The Board sent a letter to the Veteran and his representative in May 2023 indicating that his appeal had been placed on the direct review docket.  

In a January 2025 letter, the Veteran and his representative were informed that, after a more detailed review, the Board had found that his appeal did not meet the necessary procedural requirements.  Specifically, the Board found that the VA Form 10182 was not received within the time allowed by law (i.e., within one year from the date of the rating decision letter).  They were also advised that, if they believed that there was good cause to grant a time extension to submit the VA Form 10182, they could request a time extension with an explanation.  The letter further notified them that, if they disagreed with the Board's determination and believe that the appeal request is valid, they would have 60 days to respond.  However, to date, no response or extension request has been submitted.

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the Veteran did not submit a timely appeal of the April 2022 rating decision, as his VA Form 10182 was received one day after the expiration of the one-year appeal period.  He has also not requested an extension of time  to submit a VA Form 10182, and good cause has not been shown that would permit the Board to extend the time for filing a VA Form 10182.  Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed due to that claims processing defect.
