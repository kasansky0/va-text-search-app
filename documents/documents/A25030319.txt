ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, to include unspecified anxiety disorder, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric condition began during active service or is otherwise related to an in-service injury or disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from June 1993 to July 1999.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a November 2023 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Regional Office (RO), Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active military service, even if the disability was initially diagnosed after service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Establishing service connection generally requires (1) medical evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after service when all the evidence, including pertinent to service, establishes the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 999 F. 3rd 1391 (2021).

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, to include unspecified anxiety disorder.

The Veteran asserts that service connection is warranted for his acquired psychiatric condition.  

First, under the AMA, the Board is bound by favorable findings by the AOJ in the absence of evidence of clear and unmistakable error.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104 (c).  In the November 2023 rating decision, the AOJ made a favorable finding that the Veteran had a current disability of unspecified anxiety disorder diagnosed in an October 2023 VA examination.  The AOJ also confirmed that the Veteran served in a toxic exposure risk activity area (TERA) and exposure is conceded.  

For the first element of service connection, the Board finds the Veteran has a current disability.  In his October 2023 VA examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with an acquired psychiatric condition.  Therefore, the first element has been met.

For the second element, the Veteran must show evidence of complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of a psychiatric condition during his active service.  In this case, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) show evidence of no complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of a psychiatric condition.  In fact, in an entrance examination, March 1993 Report of Medical Examination, the Veteran indicated no psychiatric issues.  In a June 1997 Pre-deployment Health Assessment Questionnaire, the Veteran indicated he was in very good health and had no mental health conditions.   In reviewing the Veteran's STRs, the Board finds no complaints, treatment, or diagnoses for any psychiatric condition.  Therefore, the second element has not been met.   

Post-service VA treatment records indicate the Veteran sought mental health treatment 22 years after discharge from active service in December 2022.  He reported that he had moved to three different states, stayed with family in one state, in his vehicle, and in an apartment.  In January 2023, the Veteran reported that he was living in a homeless shelter, going through a divorce, and said, "I am going through stuff that pretty much may be the cause."  

Also, the Veteran underwent an October 2023 VA mental disorders examination.  The examiner concluded that the Veteran's condition is less likely than not incurred in or due to his military service.  The Veteran reported that his mental health issues began with childhood sexual trauma.  He also reported that he was married with children, moved three times, his wife left him in 2014, and he remarried.  Another divorce followed in 2023.  He also reported completion of high school and several years of college.  He has had consistent work and has worked at several jobs though at the time he was unemployed.  He reported anxiety and depression surrounding the marriage and reported mental health treatment through VA from August 2022 to August 2023.   

The Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for service connection.  The Board gives greater weight to the VA examiner in October 2023 who examined the Veteran and concluded his condition was less likely than not incurred in or due to his military service.  The evidence of record shows the Veteran sought treatment 22 years after discharge from service and he attributed his anxiety to the instability of his life including a previous divorce, current divorce proceedings that he was going through, and homelessness at the time he sought treatment.  

While the Board understands that the circumstances of life can be overwhelming at times, service connection must have a nexus to the Veteran's military active service.  In this case, the Veteran was married, had children, attended college, married for a second time, and had worked steadily.  In a December 2022 VA mental health note, he attributed his inability to find work to issues of the divorce and certainly issues of childhood trauma that he claims were being divulged to others causing embarrassment in a support group.  Certainly, there is every reason the Veteran sought help during such a tumultuous time in his life.  However, there is no nexus to his military service which must be shown for service connection.  

Simply stated, it can not be said that it is at least as likely as not (generally a 50% chance or greater) that the Veteran's problem was caused or aggravated by service.  The medical opinion evidence, the service medical records from 25 years ago, and the post-service medical treatment each provide highly probative evidence against this claim. 

Accordingly, entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric condition, to include unspecified anxiety disorder, is denied.    

The evidence in this case is not in approximate balance to warrant application of the benefit-of-the-doubt rule.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
