ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The probative evidence of record weigh against a finding that the Veteran's service-connected disabilities render him unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to a TDIU have not been met. 38 U.S.C. § 1155, 5107; 38C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.15, 4.18, 4.19, 3.340, 4.16(a).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the United States Air Force from March 2001 to April 2004. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a December 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). See December 2023 rating decision.

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182 Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Entitlement to total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) 

The Veteran contends that he has been unable to secure and follow substantial gainful employment due to his service-connected disability. Since the grant of a 70 percent disability rating, the Veteran has filed an 'Applications for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability' See May 2023 VA 21-8940.

The VA will grant TDIU when the evidence shows that a veteran is precluded, by reason of service-connected disabilities, from obtaining and maintaining any form of gainful employment consistent with his education and occupational experience. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. TDIU is granted only when it is established that the service-connected disabilities are so severe, standing alone, as to prevent the retaining of gainful employment. If there is only one such disability, it must be rated at least 60 percent disabling to qualify for benefits based on individual unemployability. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a). If there are two or more such disabilities, there shall be at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more, and sufficient additional disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).

Entitlement to a total rating must be based solely on the impact of service-connected disabilities on the ability to keep and maintain substantially gainful employment. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16. The central inquiry is "whether the veteran's service-connected disabilities alone are of sufficient severity to produce unemployability." Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524, 529 (1993).

Where these percentage requirements are not met, entitlement to benefits on an extraschedular basis may be considered when a veteran is unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities, and consideration is given to the veteran's background including his employment and educational history. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321 (b), 4.16(b). The Board does not have the authority to assign an extraschedular TDIU rating in the first instance. Bowling v. Principi, 15 Vet. App. 1 (2001). Rather, the issue must be referred to the Director of Compensation Service for such assessment in the first instance. Kuppamala v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 447, 457 (2015). Thereafter, the Board has jurisdiction to review the entirety of the Director's decision denying or granting an extraschedular rating and is authorized to assign an extraschedular rating when appropriate. Kuppamala, 27 Vet. App. at 457.

For VA purposes, the term unemployability is synonymous with inability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation. VAOPGPREC 75-91, 57 Fed. Reg. 2,317 (Jan. 21, 1992). Consideration may be given to the veteran's education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to his or her age or to the impairment caused by nonservice-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993). A high rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain or keep employment, but the ultimate question is whether the Veteran is capable of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he or she can find employment. Van Hoose, 4 Vet. App. at 363.

The ability to work sporadically or obtain marginal employment is not substantially gainful employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a); Moore v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 356, 358 (1991). Marginal employment, i.e., earned annual income that does not exceed the poverty threshold for one person, is not considered substantially gainful employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a).

Whether a veteran is unemployable requires the Board to "consider both that person's abilities and his employment history." Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 354 (2000).

Attention should be given to the veteran's history, education, skills, and training; whether the veteran has the physical ability (both exertional and non-exertional) to perform the types of activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., lifting, bending, sitting, standing, walking, climbing, as well as auditory and visual limitations); and whether the veteran has the mental ability to perform the activities required by the occupation at issue (e.g., memory, concentration, ability to adapt to change, handle work place stress, get along with coworkers, and demonstrate reliability and productivity). Ray v. Wilkie, 31 Vet. App. 58, 73 (2019).

The test of individual unemployability is whether the Veteran, because of his service-connected disability alone, is unable to secure or follow any form of substantially gainful occupation that is consistent with his education and occupational experience. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.321, 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

Here, the Veteran is service connected for three disabilities, namely posttraumatic stress disorder rated at 70 percent, hypertension rated at 10 percent, and tinnitus rated at 10 percent. See most recent codesheet. As such, the Veteran meets the threshold schedular criteria for a TDIU. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). The remaining inquiry is whether he is unable to secure or follow substantially gainful occupation due solely to his service-connected disabilities

The Board finds that entitlement to individual unemployability is not warranted as the Veteran has not been found unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation because of service-connected disabilities. 

The Veteran is considered capable of gainful employment. 38 CFR 4.16, 38 CFR 4.18. In a May 2023 VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability the Veteran reported working at Synchron in Canton, Ohio, in the collections department, from April 2019 to October 2019 for 25 hours per week, earning approximately $16,000 per month. The Veteran also reported working for U.P.S. delivery for 35 hours per week from December 2020 to January 2021, earning $2,100 per month. The Veteran also reported working at Citizens Bank as a teller for 20 hours per week earning $2,000 per month from March 2021 to 2023. 

The Veteran's income exceeds the poverty threshold for one person and is considered substantially gainful employment. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16 (a). Additionally, the Veteran did not complete the application in full. Some sections such as current annual income was left blank. 

The Veteran has a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Music technology from Kent State University. The Veteran has been a teller at Citizens Bank for almost two years. Additionally, the Veteran reported being a DJ part-time. 

The Veteran is 45 years of age. The Veteran does not experience any physical disabilities which are service connected. 

The Veteran did not complete a VA 21-4192 Request for Employment Information in Connection with Claim for Disability. There are no private examinations or VA examinations of record which provide an opinion on whether it is at least as likely as not (50 percent probability or greater) that the Veteran is able to perform a substantially gainful occupation. 

The Veteran was offered two Compensation and Pension (C&P) examinations regarding his PTSD in February 2023 and November 2023. See November 2023 C&P Exam and February 2023 C&P Exam. The November 2023 examiner noted that the Veteran does not have any job-related difficulties secondary to his mental health issues. The Veteran does not experience total occupational and social impairment. A high rating in itself is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain or keep employment. Van Hoose, 4 Vet. App. at 363. 

The February 2023 examiner noted that the Veteran abused alcohol, smoked marijuana, did cocaine and ecstasy. The Veteran's post-military substance abuse history was reported as still smoking marijuana but less alcohol use. He reported not using any other illegal drugs. The Veteran's pre-military legal and behavioral history included being arrested as a juvenile for joy riding. He went to juvenile detention and did community service. During the military, the Veteran reported being arrested for breaking into cars. He had to go to jail for a week. He was discharged from the Air Force for marijuana use. Post-military, the Veteran only has a DUI. His license was suspended for five years. The aforementioned factors have affected the Veteran's ability to secure substantially gainful occupation. 

The Board has considered both the economic and non-economic factors to include educational and occupational history affecting the Veteran's ability to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993). 

As such, the Board finds that entitlement to individual unemployability is not warranted as the evidence fails to show that the Veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a sole result of his service-connected disabilities. 38 CFR 4.16, 38 CFR 4.18. The probative evidence of record weights against the claim and the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable. TDIU is thus not warranted in this case. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
