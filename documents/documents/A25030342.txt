DOCKET NO. 241104-489504
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Special monthly compensation based on aid and attendance due to residuals of traumatic brain injury (SMC-T) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran requires regular aid and attendance for residuals of TBI in order to avoid hospitalization, nursing home care, or other residual institutional care, and the Veteran is not eligible for SMC(r)(2).

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for SMC-T have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(t); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(j).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Army from October 2009 to April 2010 and from September 2013 to January 2016.

These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an August 2024 Higher-Level Review of January 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  This appeal is being adjudicated under the modern appellate framework.  In the November 2024 notice of disagreement which commenced his appeal, the Veteran opted into the Evidence Submission Docket.

The Board may only consider the evidence of record before the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) at the time of its decision on the issue(s) on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his or her representative with the NOD (VA Form 10182) or within 90 days following receipt of the NOD.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300(a), 303.  If additional evidence was submitted between the dates of the AOJ decision and VA's receipt of the NOD, the Board will not consider it unless it is resubmitted during the 90 days following VA's receipt of the NOD.  If evidence is not resubmitted, the Veteran is welcome to file a supplemental claim to have this evidence considered.  Id.; Cook v. McDonough, No. 20-6853, 2023 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 808 (Vet. App. May 17, 2023).

Entitlement to SMC-T is granted.

At issue is whether the Veteran is entitled to SMC-T.  The weight of the evidence indicates that the criteria for SMC-T have been met.

A May 2023 VA examination indicated that the Veteran's TBI residuals are intertwined with the symptoms of the Veteran's previously service-connected psychiatric disorder.     

A December 2019 rating decision previously found that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms cause the need for regular aid and attendance in order to manage the Veteran's medication and protect the Veteran from the dangers incident to his environment.  The Board is found by this favorable finding.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104. 

The evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran meets the requirements to receive compensation as listed under 38 U.S.C. § 1114(r)(2).  Eligibility for SMC(r)(2) requires a Veteran to be in receipt of SMC at the (o) rate, the maximum rate under (p), or an intermediate rate between the (n) and (o) rates plus a (k) rate.  38 U.S.C. § 1114(r); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(h).  Eligibility for SMC at the (n), (o), and maximum (p) rates requires that a Veteran, due to service-connected disability, experience anatomical loss or loss of use of an extremity, bilateral blindness, bilateral deafness, or paraplegia.  38 U.S.C. § 1114 (n)-(p); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (d)-(f).  The evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran has experienced the anatomical loss or loss of use of any extremities, bilateral blindness, bilateral deafness, or paraplegia. 

As the Veteran is already in receipt of SMC(l) due to the need for aid and attendance due to his residuals of TBI and psychiatric condition, and he is not eligible for SMC(r)(2), the question for the Board is whether in the absence of regular aid and attendance the Veteran would require hospitalization, nursing home care, or other residential institutional care.

The Veteran submitted a private medical opinion from a neurologist who reviewed the entirety of his claims file and determined that as a result of his TBI and residuals, the Veteran requires the aid and attendance of others and without that assistance, he would require institutional care.  The examiner noted that the Veteran requires assistance in managing medication, ambulating, bathing, eating, cooking, transferring, conducting hygiene, and numerous other activities of daily living.  Without the Veteran's mother and sister, he would require inpatient facility care such as a nursing home.

Taken together, the Board concludes that The Veteran requires regular aid and attendance for residuals of TBI in order to avoid hospitalization, nursing home care, or other residual institutional care.  

The weight of the evidence indicates that the criteria for SMC-T have been met.   38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.  As such, SMC-T is granted.
