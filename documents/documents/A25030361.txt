REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from April 1997 to April 2001. 

In the December 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review in June 2021. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that the Veteran's attorney wrote "Left and right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy - EED" on the VA Form 10182. The attached argument makes it clear that the Veteran is appealing all increased ratings that were made effective on November 10, 2020 and were not granted back to March 12, 2020. Thus, the claims on appeal are earlier effective dates for the increased ratings for the right and left sciatic nerves and right and left ilio-inguinal nerves. 

With his VA Form 10182, the Veteran's attorney submitted argument. New evidence submitted with a VA Form 10182 on which the Direct Review option is selected creates uncertainty as to which Board review option the claimant intended, triggering the Board's duty to seek clarification under 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(f). See Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023). However, the Board finds that clarification is not needed. This statement was not evidence, but rather argument in support of his claims. Therefore, the Board can proceed.

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 10, 2020 for the increased 30 percent rating for the service-connected vertigo is denied. 

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than November 10, 2020 for the increased 30 percent rating for his service-connected vertigo. On March 12, 2020, VA received the initial claim for service connection for vertigo. The AOJ granted service connection in a July 2020 rating decision and assigned a 10 percent rating, effective March 12, 2020. On November 10, 2020, within one year of the rating decision, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim to appeal the initial rating. In a March 2021 rating decision, the AOJ increased the Veteran's vertigo rating to 30 percent, effective November 10, 2020. The Veteran requested a higher-level review of the effective date in April 2021, which the AOJ denied in June 2021. The Veteran appealed the November 10, 2020 effective date for the 30 percent rating in his December 2021 VA Form 10182. 

The Board finds that the Veteran continuously pursued his initial March 12, 2020 claim since he filed the Supplemental Claim within one year of the July 2020 rating decision, which led to the appeal before the Board. Accordingly, the question before the Board is whether the Veteran's vertigo warrants a 30 percent rating prior to the current November 10, 2020 effective date.

Vertigo is governed by 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6204. Under Diagnostic Code 6204, a 10 percent rating is warranted for occasional dizziness and a 30 percent rating is warranted for dizziness and occasional staggering. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.87, Diagnostic Code 6204.

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran underwent a VA multiple sclerosis examination in January 2020. At that time, he reported that he occasionally had to call out of work due to symptoms including disequilibrium. He underwent a VA ear conditions examination in July 2020 and reported lightheadedness, dizziness, and intermittent ringing sensation in his ears, especially when showering. He also complained of lower extremity weakness that impairs standing and causes stumbling. The examiner documented he had vertigo more than once weekly and that the episodes last between 1 and 24 hours. The examiner did not document any staggering. The examiner also documented a normal gait and a normal or negative Romberg test (which evaluates for unsteadiness).

The Veteran's private records show a neurology visit in February 2020. He complained of increasing balance difficulty in the past several months that is worse in the dark and if he closes his eyes in the shower. He denied dizziness and his gait was assessed as normal. His examiner theorized that his balance trouble was likely due to the diminished sensation in his feet and the Veteran declined balance training physical therapy at that time. In August 2020, he reported that he walks independently and denied falls. He did report increased weakness in his left leg. 

The Veteran underwent another VA ear conditions examination in March 2021. He reported that his symptoms had worsened since service connection in 2020, including that he had to sit down when showering and his dizziness worsened when he closed his eyes causing him to fall. He reported that he had fallen three times in 2021 by the examination in March and he swayed when he walked and stood. 

After considering the evidence, the Board finds that a 30 percent rating is not warranted prior to November 10, 2020. The evidence prior to the March 2021 examinations showed dizziness and disequilibrium but did not show that his vertigo caused staggering or similar impairment. Instead, the evidence showed a consistently normal gait, and the Veteran reported that he walked independently and denied falls as late as August 2020. Critically, the Veteran reported in the March 2021 examination that his vertigo worsened noticeably in 2021 as it caused him to fall and sway while walking and necessitated sitting while showering. That examination also showed an unsteady gait and an abnormal Romberg test. These symptoms are comparable to staggering and triggered the increased rating. The Board thus finds that the impairment caused by the Veteran's vertigo prior to November 10, 2020 is adequately represented by a 10 percent rating. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran reported stumbling and intermittent falls after walking for prolonged periods in the July 2020 peripheral neuropathy examination. Because these symptoms are caused by his peripheral neuropathy ratings, rather than vertigo episodes, the Board did not consider these reported symptoms for rating his vertigo. Furthermore, these symptoms are contemplated for his peripheral neuropathy ratings and assigning a higher rating for his vertigo based on the same manifestations would constitute impermissible pyramiding. See 38 C.F.R. 4.14.

In the November 2020 Supplemental Claim, the Veteran's attorney argued that VA made "no indication whether the Veteran experiences staggering." The July 2020 VA examiner documented vertigo episodes but did not document staggering episodes on the examination report. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the examiner did not document staggering because the evidence did not support it.  

The Veteran's attorney also argued in the December 2021 VA Form 10182 that the effective date should be March 12, 2020 because the Veteran continuously pursued his claim.  It is well-established, however, that at the time of an initial rating, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found - a practice known as staged ratings. See Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509 (2007). Even if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). Continuous pursuit, in and of itself, is not a guarantee that any increased rating assigned will be from the date of claim.  Here, the evidence shows that his condition is adequately contemplated by a 10 percent rating prior to November 10, 2020. The evidence does not show that his condition worsened until the March 2021 examination. Because the examination was ordered based on his November 10, 2020 Supplemental Claim, the AOJ ruled in the Veteran's favor and assigned November 10, 2020 as the effective date for his increased 30 percent rating. As the facts do not show that his condition worsened prior to November 10, 2020, an earlier effective date is not warranted. Accordingly, the claim is denied. 

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 10, 2020 for the increased 40 percent rating for the service-connected right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic nerve is denied. 

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than November 10, 2020 for the increased 40 percent rating for his service-connected right lower extremity sciatica. On March 12, 2020, VA received the initial claim for service connection for peripheral neuropathy. The AOJ granted service connection in a July 2020 rating decision and assigned a 10 percent rating, effective March 12, 2020. On November 10, 2020, within one year of the rating decision, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim to appeal the initial rating. In a March 2021 rating decision, the AOJ increased the Veteran's rating to 40 percent, effective November 10, 2020. The Veteran requested a higher-level review of the effective date of the 40 percent rating in April 2021. In June 2021, the AOJ increased the 10 percent rating to 20 percent prior to November 10, 2020, but denied a rating higher than 40 percent thereafter. The Veteran appealed the November 10, 2020 effective date for the 40 percent rating in his December 2021 VA Form 10182. 

The Board finds that the Veteran continuously pursued his initial March 12, 2020 claim since he filed the Supplemental Claim within one year of the July 2020 rating decision, which led to the appeal before the Board. Accordingly, the question before the Board is whether the Veteran's right lower extremity sciatica warrants a 40 percent rating prior to the current November 10, 2020 effective date.

His disability is currently rated under?38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8520, which rates as follows: mild incomplete paralysis (10 percent); moderate incomplete paralysis (20 percent); moderately severe incomplete paralysis (40 percent); severe incomplete paralysis, with marked muscular atrophy (60 percent); and complete paralysis (80 percent). 

Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based on the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.?See 38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. See?38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.?The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves."? When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.?See id.?The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory.?See Miller v. Shulkin, 28?Vet. App.?376 (2017).?? 

Neither the Rating Schedule nor the regulations provide definitions for descriptive words such as "mild," "moderate," "moderately severe," and "severe."? Spellers v. Wilkie, 30?Vet. App.?211, 219 (2018).? Although the Board has at times attempted to define these terms using dictionary definitions, those definitions are problematic because they "do little to explain the Board's understanding of these terms and do not 'disclos[e] that benchmark it employed to reach [its] conclusion.'" Casey v. McDonough, No. 21-7569, slip op. at 3 (Vet. App. Jan. 24, 2023) (mem dec) (Falvey, J.) (quoting Johnson v. Wilkie, 30?Vet. App.?245, 255 (2018)).? 

As explained in LeMon v. McDonough, these regulations leave gaps in defining the relevant terms that are filled by VA's Adjudication Manual, M21-1:???? 

The Board "is required to discuss any relevant provisions contained in the M21-1 as part of its duty to provide adequate reasons or bases," Overton, 30 Vet. App. at 264. Clearly relevant to this case are M21-1 provisions regarding evaluations of paralysis of the sciatic nerve. The M21-1 describes mild incomplete paralysis as a disability "limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a smaller area." Part V, sbpt. iii, ch. 12, sec. A.2.c. And moderate incomplete paralysis, per the M21-1, should be "reserved for the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment," where the sensory involvement covers "a larger area in the nerve distribution." Id. M21-1 examples of a moderate disability include "motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate." Id. And the M21-1 provides that a moderately severe evaluation (that is, a 40% rating) is available when there is "[m]otor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a higher level of limitation or disability." Id. Atrophy may, but need not, be present for a moderately severe rating.??? 

LeMon v. McDonough, No. 21-3949, 2022 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 1998, *7 (Dec. 16, 2022) (mem dec) (Toth, J.). For severe, incomplete paralysis expect motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, atrophy or weakness), trophic changes, and marked muscular atrophy at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability. See?M21-1, Part V, sbpt. iii, ch. 12, sec. A.2.c. Neuritis characterized by loss of reflexes, muscle atrophy, sensory disturbances, and constant pain should be rated as high as?severe?incomplete?paralysis?of the nerve. See id.? 

Given the relevance of these provisions to rating disabilities of the peripheral nerves, "the Board's failure to mention the M21-1's relevant guidance in this area constitutes clear error."? LeMon, 2022 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 1998, *7. The Board will therefore mention, and apply, these definitions in the instant case.? 

The Veteran's private records show a neurology visit in February 2020. He complained of increased balance difficulty in the past several months. A neurological evaluation showed a normal gait, 5/5 muscle strength bilaterally, normal reflexes, and intact sensation except for his foot/toes which had decreased sensation. There was no evidence of muscle atrophy or lower extremity weakness.  His examiner theorized that his balance trouble was likely due to the diminished sensation in his feet and the Veteran declined balance training physical therapy at that time. 

In August 2020, he reported increased fatigue in his left leg. He denied falls and reported he still walks independently. The provider noted that he did not detect weakness at the visit but the Veteran "does have exertional fatigue and weakness." He also reported painful paresthesias that is well controlled with medication. 

The Veteran underwent peripheral nerves examinations in July 2020 and March 2021. Comparing the VA examinations to the rating criteria reveals the following:? 

Regarding impairment of motor functions, the Veteran had 4/5 muscle strength for the entire right lower extremity in July 2020 and March 2021. He also had an abnormal gait in July 2020 and March 2021.

Regarding loss of reflexes, the Veteran had normal reflexes for the entire right lower extremity in July 2020 and March 2021.  

Regarding pain, the Veteran reported mild constant pain and moderate intermittent pain in July 2020 and severe constant pain in March 2021. 

Regarding sensory disturbance, in July 2020, the Veteran reported moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and moderate numbness. On examination, he had decreased sensation for the entire right lower extremity. In March 2021, he reported severe paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and severe numbness. On examination, he had decreased sensation for the entire right lower extremity.

Regarding trophic changes, the Veteran had no trophic changes in July 2020 and had shiny legs and hair loss in March 2021.  

Regarding muscle atrophy, the Veteran had no muscle atrophy in July 2020 or March 2021. 

Regarding complete paralysis, both examinations were negative for complete paralysis. 

The Veteran was diagnosed with mild incomplete paralysis of the right sciatic nerve in July 2020 and moderately severe incomplete paralysis in March 2021. 

After considering the evidence, the Board finds that a 40 percent rating is not warranted prior to November 10, 2020. Per VA guidelines, a 40 percent rating is available for motor and/or reflex impairment at a grade reflecting a higher level of limitation or disability. Here, the evidence shows 4/5 muscle strength, abnormal gait without use of an assistive device, and normal reflexes, which do not meet the criteria for a 40 percent rating. While an assistive device is not explicitly contemplated by the guidelines, the lack of an assistive device weighs against a high level of motor impairment. The Veteran's current 40 percent rating is based on the evidence of worsened symptoms demonstrated in the March 2021 examination such as constant pain and trophic changes. 

The Board considered the August 2020 private treatment record, in which the provider noted "subjective symptoms of fatigue in the left leg are getting worse slowly." The Board finds that this is insufficient to demonstrate entitlement to a higher rating for the right leg. Moreover, at that visit, the Veteran denied falls and reported that he walks independently, which weighs against motor impairment that warrants a 40 percent rating. Finally, the Veteran's 20 percent rating specifically contemplates motor impairment such as weakness. The Board thus finds that the impairment caused by the Veteran's right lower extremity sciatica prior to November 10, 2020 is best represented by the current 20 percent rating. 

The Veteran's attorney argues that the effective date should be March 12, 2020 because the Veteran continuously pursued his claim. Again, continuous pursuit, in and of itself, is not a guarantee that any increased rating assigned will be from the date of claim, and staged ratings can be assigned based on the facts found.  Here, the evidence shows that his condition is adequately contemplated by a 20 percent rating prior to November 10, 2020. The evidence does not show that his condition met the criteria for a 40 percent rating until the March 2021 examination. Because the examination was ordered based on his November 10, 2020 Supplemental Claim, the AOJ ruled in the Veteran's favor and assigned November 10, 2020 as the effective date for his increased 40 percent rating. 

The Board acknowledges the attorney's argument that the Supplemental Claim was filed as an appeal of the initial assigned rating and, if increased rating was triggered by the Supplemental Claim, it should date back to the original claim. Critically, the facts in this case do not support that the symptoms that were present at the time of the March 2021 examination were present prior to November 10, 2020. Because the Supplemental Claim raised the issue of worsening, it is a more favorable effective date to the Veteran than the date of the March 2021 examination, which is actually when the facts established the higher rating was warranted.  

Furthermore, that the March 2021 examination demonstrated worsening does not mean the July 2020 examination was inadequate. It simply means that the Veteran's condition increased in severity between July 2020 and March 2021, which is supported by the Veteran's own statements. This includes the Veteran's own reports that his sensory symptoms increased from mild constant pain, moderate intermittent pain, moderate paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and moderate numbness in July 2020 to severe constant pain, severe paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and severe numbness in March 2021. The March 2021 examination also showed objective evidence of worsening, like trophic changes, which did not exist at the time of the July 2020 examination. The attorney has not sufficiently demonstrated how the July 2020 examination was inadequate, and the evidence simply does not support that it was. 

The attorney also asserted that VA's criteria for assessing peripheral neuropathy is subjective and VA's initial assessment of his condition's severity was inadequate. The Board applied the Veteran's manifestations to the criteria utilizing VA's guidelines, supported by Court decisions, and concluded that his condition did not warrant a 40 percent rating prior to November 10, 2020. 

Finally, the Board considered that the Veteran's records show he was prescribed medication for his neuropathic pain. The Court has held that in assigning a disability rating, VA may not consider the ameliorative effects of medication where such effects are not explicitly contemplated by the rating criteria. Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56 (2012). Here, the Board considered the Veteran's reports of his neuropathic pain, paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and numbness as documented in the VA examination reports. Thus, the Board rated his condition based on his own statements. 

As the facts do not show that his condition satisfied the criteria for a 40 percent rating prior to November 10, 2020, an earlier effective date is not warranted. Accordingly, the claim is denied. 

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 10, 2020 for the increased 40 percent rating for the service-connected left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the sciatic nerve is denied. 

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than November 10, 2020 for the increased 40 percent rating for his service-connected left lower extremity sciatica. On March 12, 2020, VA received the initial claim for service connection for peripheral neuropathy. The AOJ granted service connection in a July 2020 rating decision and assigned a 20 percent rating, effective March 12, 2020. On November 10, 2020, within one year of the rating decision, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim to appeal the initial rating. In a March 2021 rating decision, the AOJ increased the Veteran's rating to 40 percent, effective November 10, 2020. The Veteran requested a higher-level review of the effective date for the 40 percent rating in April 2021, and the AOJ denied the request. The Veteran appealed the November 10, 2020 effective date for the 40 percent rating in his December 2021 VA Form 10182. 

The Board finds that the Veteran continuously pursued his initial March 12, 2020 claim since he filed the Supplemental Claim within one year of the July 2020 rating decision, which led to the appeal before the Board. Accordingly, the question before the Board is whether the Veteran's left lower extremity sciatica warrants a 40 percent rating prior to the current November 10, 2020 effective date.

The Veteran's private records show a neurology visit in February 2020. He complained of increased balance difficulty in the past several months. A neurological evaluation showed a normal gait, 5/5 muscle strength bilaterally, normal reflexes, and intact sensation except for his foot/toes which had decreased sensation. There was no evidence of muscle atrophy or lower extremity weakness.  His examiner theorized that his balance trouble was likely due to the diminished sensation in his feet and the Veteran declined balance training physical therapy at that time. 

In August 2020, he reported increased fatigue in his left leg. He denied falls and reported he still walks independently. The provider noted that he did not detect weakness at the visit but the Veteran "does have exertional fatigue and weakness." He also reported painful paresthesias that is well controlled with medication. 

The Veteran underwent peripheral nerves examinations in July 2020 and March 2021. Comparing the VA examinations to the rating criteria reveals the following:? 

Regarding impairment of motor functions, the Veteran had 4/5 muscle strength for the entire left lower extremity in July 2020 and March 2021. He also had an abnormal gait in July 2020 and March 2021.

Regarding loss of reflexes, the Veteran had normal reflexes for the entire left lower extremity in July 2020 and March 2021.  

Regarding pain, the Veteran reported moderate constant pain and severe intermittent pain in July 2020 and severe constant pain in March 2021. 

Regarding sensory disturbance, in July 2020, the Veteran reported severe paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and severe numbness. On examination, he had decreased sensation for the entire left lower extremity. In March 2021, he reported severe paresthesias and/or dysesthesias and severe numbness. On examination, he had absent sensation for the left upper anterior thigh and thigh/knee and decreased sensation for the left lower leg/ankle and foot/toes in March 2021. 

Regarding trophic changes, the Veteran had no trophic changes in July 2020 and had shiny legs and hair loss in March 2021.  

Regarding muscle atrophy, the Veteran had no muscle atrophy in July 2020 or March 2021. 

Regarding complete paralysis, both examinations were negative for complete paralysis. 

The Veteran was diagnosed with moderate incomplete paralysis of the left sciatic nerve in July 2020 and moderately severe incomplete paralysis in March 2021. 

After considering the evidence, the Board finds that a 40 percent rating is not warranted prior to November 10, 2020. Per VA guidelines, a 40 percent rating is available for motor and/or reflex impairment at a grade reflecting a higher level of limitation or disability. Here, the evidence shows 4/5 muscle strength, abnormal gait without use of an assistive device, and normal reflexes, which do not meet the criteria for a 40 percent rating. While an assistive device is not explicitly contemplated by the guidelines, the lack of an assistive device weighs against a high level of motor impairment. The Veteran's current 40 percent rating is based on the evidence of worsened symptoms demonstrated in the March 2021 examination such as severe constant pain, trophic changes, and absent sensation in the upper anterior thigh and thigh/knee. 

The Board considered the August 2020 private treatment record, in which the provider noted "subjective symptoms of fatigue in the left leg are getting worse slowly." At that visit, the Veteran denied falls and reported that he walks independently, which weighs against motor impairment that warrants a 40 percent rating. Finally, the Veteran's 20 percent rating specifically contemplates motor impairment such as weakness. The Board thus finds that the impairment caused by the Veteran's left lower extremity sciatica prior to November 10, 2020 is best represented by the current 20 percent rating.

The Board emphasizes that the March 2021 examination also contains lay and objective medical evidence of worsening for the left lower extremity sciatica. The Veteran reported that his pain symptoms increased from moderate constant pain and severe intermittent pain in July 2020 to severe constant pain in March 2021. The March 2021 examination also shows objective evidence of worsening, like absent sensation and trophic changes, which did not exist at the time of the July 2020 examination. 

As the facts do not show that his condition satisfied the criteria for a 40 percent rating prior to November 10, 2020, an earlier effective date is not warranted. Accordingly, the claim is denied. 

4. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 10, 2020 for the increased 10 percent rating for the service-connected right lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the ilio-inguinal nerve is denied. 

5. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 10, 2020 for the increased 10 percent rating for the service-connected left lower extremity peripheral neuropathy of the ilio-inguinal nerve is denied.

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than November 10, 2020 for the increased 10 percent rating for his service-connected peripheral neuropathy of the right and left lower extremity ilio-inguinal nerves. On March 12, 2020, VA received the initial claim for service connection for peripheral neuropathy. The AOJ granted service connection for peripheral neuropathy of the right and left lower extremity ilio-inguinal nerves in a July 2020 rating decision and assigned a 0 percent rating, effective March 12, 2020. On November 10, 2020, within one year of the rating decision, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim to appeal the initial rating. In a March 2021 rating decision, the AOJ increased the Veteran's ratings to 10 percent, effective November 10, 2020. The Veteran requested a higher-level review of the effective date for the 10 percent ratings in April 2021, and the AOJ denied the request. The Veteran appealed the November 10, 2020 effective date for the 10 percent ratings in his December 2021 VA Form 10182. 

The Board finds that the Veteran continuously pursued his initial March 12, 2020 claim since he filed the Supplemental Claim within one year of the July 2020 rating decision, which led to the appeal before the Board. Accordingly, the question before the Board is whether the Veteran's right and left lower extremity ilio-inguinal neuropathies warrant 10 percent ratings prior to the current November 10, 2020 effective date.

Paralysis of the ilio-inguinal nerve is governed by Diagnostic Code 8530, which rates it as follows: mild or moderate paralysis (0 percent); and severe to complete paralysis (10 percent). See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8530. Per the M21-1, the ilio-inguinal nerve affects motor and sensory function of the lower abdominal wall, thigh, scrotum, and labia majora. See M21-1 Part V, sbpt. iii, ch. 12, sec. A.2.e.

The Veteran's private records show a neurology visit in February 2020. He complained of increased balance difficulty in the past several months. A neurological evaluation showed a normal gait, 5/5 muscle strength bilaterally, normal reflexes, and intact sensation except for his foot/toes which had decreased sensation. There was no evidence of muscle atrophy or lower extremity weakness.  His examiner theorized that his balance trouble was likely due to the diminished sensation in his feet and the Veteran declined balance training physical therapy at that time. 

In August 2020, he reported increased fatigue in his left leg. He denied falls and reported he still walks independently. The provider noted that he did not detect weakness at the visit but the Veteran "does have exertional fatigue and weakness." He also reported painful paresthesias that is well controlled with medication. 

The Veteran underwent peripheral nerves examinations in July 2020 and March 2021. In July 2020, he had decreased sensation in his right and left upper anterior thigh. In March 2021, he had decreased sensation in his right upper anterior thigh and absent sensation in his left upper anterior thigh. He also reported severe abdominal pain that radiates to his legs. Regarding complete paralysis, both examinations were negative for complete paralysis. 

The Veteran was diagnosed with mild incomplete paralysis of the right ilio-inguinal nerve and moderate incomplete paralysis of the left ilio-inguinal nerve in July 2020. He was diagnosed with severe incomplete paralysis of the right ilio-inguinal nerve and severe incomplete paralysis of the left ilio-inguinal nerve in March 2021. 

After considering the evidence, the Board finds that 10 percent ratings are not warranted prior to November 10, 2020. Per VA guidelines, for severe incomplete paralysis, expect motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, atrophy or weakness), trophic changes, and marked muscular atrophy at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability. See M21-1, Part V, sbpt. iii, ch. 12, sec. A.2.c. Here, the evidence does not show such symptoms prior to November 10, 2020. Unlike the July 2020 examination, the March 2021 examination shows radiating abdominal pain and absent left upper anterior thigh sensation. Although the March 2021 examination does not show absent right upper anterior thigh sensation, the Board will not disturb the 10 percent rating. The Board thus finds that the impairment caused by the Veteran's right and left ilio-inguinal neuropathies prior to November 10, 2020 is best represented by the current 0 percent rating.

The Board incorporates the response to the attorney's arguments and the discussion regarding medication use located in the previous section for the lower extremity sciatica. 

As the facts do not show that his right and left ilio-inguinal neuropathies satisfied the criteria for a 10 percent rating prior to November 10, 2020, earlier effective dates are not warranted. Accordingly, the claims are denied. 

6. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than November 10, 2020 for the award of DEA basic eligibility is denied. 

The appeal for an effective date earlier than November 10, 2020 for the award of DEA basic eligibility is based on the appeals for earlier effective dates for the increased ratings for vertigo, left and right lower extremity sciatica, and peripheral neuropathy of the right and left ilio-inguinal nerves. Because the Board denied those appeals, this appeal must also be denied, as that is the date as of which he had a combined 100 percent rating, making him eligible for DEA benefits.
