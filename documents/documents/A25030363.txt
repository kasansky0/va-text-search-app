CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date of April 30, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for a left knee disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date of April 30, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for a right knee disability have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the Army from December 2015 to April 2022 with additional service in the Army Reserve. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in May 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act.

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that pursuant to Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (U.S. 2024), due to the possibility of a docket switch, the Board cannot adjudicate an appeal until after one year from the date the AOJ mailed the decision on appeal, or 60 days from the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, whichever is later. However, as the Veteran is being granted the earliest effective date allowable by law, there is no prejudice to the Veteran.

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 6, 2023, for the award of service connection for a left knee disability.

2. Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 6, 2023, for the award of service connection for a right knee disability

In the June 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran contends that for the award of service connection for his left knee disability and right knee disability he is entitled to an effective date of April 23, 2023, the date of his original service connection claim.

For an original claim received within one year of separation from service, the effective date shall be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2). Otherwise, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

With regard to the date of entitlement, the term "date entitlement arose" is not defined in the current statute or regulation. However, it is the date when the veteran met the requirements for the benefits sought, which is determined on a "facts found" basis. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a); McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28, 35 (2000). An effective date generally can be no earlier than the "facts found." DeLisio v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011). These "facts found" include the date the disability first manifested and the date entitlement to benefits was authorized by law and regulation.

Under the AMA, an effective date can be preserved if the claim is continuously pursued by filing an appropriate administrative review option to an AMA decision, generally within one year from when the decision was issued. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c). If an AMA claim is continuously pursued, it will be considered filed as of the date of the first claim in the continuously pursued chain, not the date the most recent request for review was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h).

By way of background, VA received the Veteran's original service connection claim on April 23, 2023. A September 2023 rating decision denied service connection. The Veteran appealed in a December 2023 Supplemental Claim. Service connection was then granted in the May 2024 rating decision on appeal.

Thus, the evidence reflects that the Veteran continuously pursued his claim until the award of service connection in a May 2024 rating decision. The evidence reflects that no intent to file or service connection claim for a left knee disability or right knee disability was received earlier than April 23, 2023. As the Veteran's original service connection claim was received within a year of his separation from service, an effective date prior to December 6, 2023, is permitted if entitlement to service connection for the Veteran's knee disabilities arose during his service.

Turning to the evidence of record, the Veteran contends on the April 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ that due to over 20 military airborne jumps during his service his knees are "in bad shape." He states that he also participated in multiple ruck marches with over 40 ponds and field exercises in the desert with uneven environments. The Veteran states that on occasions, he landed wrong and that his knees are in bad condition with a limited range of motion and sharp pains on a daily basis. Finally, the Veteran states that his left knee disability and right knee disability make it difficult to exercise and walk on a daily basis.

The Veteran reported at the June 2023 VA examination that he experiences on and off pain in the knees with standing, walking, and sitting. He also reported occasional swelling of his knees. With regards to the onset of his symptoms, the Veteran stated that he began to experience knee pain during service in 2018 as a result of being airborne and that he has undergone physical therapy to treat his left knee disability and right knee disability.

The June 2023 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran did not have a current diagnosis for either of his knees and that the Veteran's symptoms do not cause any functional impact. The VA examiner did not perform adequate diagnostic testing in conjunction with the examination.

The Veteran underwent additional VA examination in February 2024 where the Veteran reported chronic knee pain and that his knee disabilities were caused by his military occupation specialty as a paratrooper with over 20 jumps with hard landings on many occasions. The Veteran also reported in 2021 that he went to a unit that was doing many rock marches and them he started noticing chronic progression of his knee pain.

The VA examiner completed x-ray imaging of the Veteran's knees and diagnosed the Veteran with a bilateral knee strain and a right knee meniscal tear. The VA examiner indicated that the pain the Veteran experiences limits prolonged walking, running, crouching, crawling, bending, and kneeling and limits torsional motion at the joint. The VA examiner opined in favor of service connection stating that the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) and medical records indicate that he has experienced chronic knee pain since his service.

The Veteran's STRs contain multiple complaints of bilateral knee pain.

Upon review, the Board affords probative weight to the competent medical evidence of the February 2024 examination report with regards to the Veteran's diagnosis. Here, the Board finds that the February 2024 examination report is based on a review of the claims file, consideration of the Veteran's statements, appropriate testing, and examination. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008). Consequently, the Board affords no probative value to the June 2023 VA examination report with regard to the Veteran's diagnosis as the appropriate testing was not conducted by the examiner.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to report his observable symptomatology and the Board notes that he has consistently reported experiencing bilateral knee pain since his service. The Board also notes that the Veteran's lay statements are consistent with the findings of the February 2024 VA examiner. Accordingly, the Board affords the Veteran's lay statements probative value. See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994).

Additionally, the medical evidence and lay evidence of record reflects that he began experiencing the symptoms associated with his knee disabilities during service and that he credibly reported continuing to experience these symptoms after his separation from service. Thus, the evidence reflects that the Veteran's left knee disability and right knee disability arose during his service and the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability and right knee disability arose prior to the Veteran's April 2023 claim.

Based on the above-stated facts and regulations, the Board finds that the correct effective date for the award of service connection for a left knee disability and right knee disability is April 30, 2022, the day following the Veteran's separation from service. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Accordingly, the weight of the evidence is in favor of the claim and an effective date of April 30, 2022, but no earlier, for the award of service connection for a left knee disability and right knee disability is granted. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500(h), 3.400, 4.16. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).
