ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bone spurs is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for tendonitis is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The persuasive weight of the evidence does not demonstrate that the Veteran's diagnosed bone spurs were incurred in or due to his military service.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for bone spurs are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2.  The criteria for service connection for tendonitis are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from February 1993 to February 1997.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In his September 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket under the modernized appeal review system ("AMA").  Under the Direct Review docket, the Board is authorized to review only the evidence considered by the AOJ at the time of the September 2023 rating decision.  The Board may not consider evidence presented outside of the timeframe discussed above.  Any evidence obtained or associated with the record following the September 2023 rating decision has not been considered by the Board in its decision on the claims.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

1. Entitlement to service connection for bone spurs.

2. Entitlement to service connection for tendonitis.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §3.303.  The three elements required to establish service connection are: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  Certain chronic diseases will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if they were noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309; Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The Veteran contends he bone spur and tendonitis disabilities that were incurred in or due to his time in service.  He attributes his bone spurs to his military boot camp and his tendonitis to overexertion while serving aboard the USS Supply and working in shipyards in San Diego and Norfolk more than 25 years ago.

The Veteran has been diagnosed with bone spurs and tendonitis.  See, e.g., August 2023, VA treatment records.  His post-service VA treatment records reflect that he had an achilles tendo debridement and removal of bone spurs in December 2021 and was diagnosed as having achilles tendonitis on August 25, 2023.  The Veteran's records also reflect that tendonitis in both quadriceps was diagnosed on August 25, 2023.  Accordingly, the first element of service connection has been met.

The Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not show treatment for, complaint of, or diagnosis of bone spurs or tendonitis while in service.  The Veteran's Report of Medical History that was taken during his enlistment examination shows that he had a toe-related issue when he entered service; however, his physical examination did not reveal or mention any prior bone spurs or tendonitis.  More importantly, the Veteran's November 1996 separation examination did not indicate that he had incurred an injury or developed any bone spurs or tendonitis during his active-duty service.  

In the accompanying Report of Medical History, the Veteran indicated, "I'm in best health."  He denied having any foot trouble, bone, joint or other deformity, or knee-related issues.

Overall, the Board must find that the Veteran's own statements during service and soon following service provide highly probative evidence against these claims.  

The Board notes the Veteran was not provided VA examinations nor were medical  opinions requested regarding the Veteran's claimed bone spur and tendonitis disabilities.  However, VA need not conduct an examination with respect to the claims on appeal, as information and the evidence of record contains sufficient competent medical evidence to decide the claim.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4).  Under McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 76 (2006), VA must provide an examination when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, and (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the claimant qualifies, and (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability may be associated with the Veteran's service or with another service connected disability, but (4) insufficient competent medical evidence on file for VA to make a decision on the claim.  Here, while the evidence of record reflects that the Veteran has currently diagnosed bone spur and tendonitis disabilities, the Veteran's STRs do not show an in-service occurrence of such.

Simply stated, the standards of McLendon are not met in this case as the Veteran is not shown to have incurred or suffered from bone spurs or tendonitis while in service and there is no other competent medical evidence suggesting an association to service.

Additionally, toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) examinations were not requested because regulations regarding TERA examinations determined there is no association between these conditions and participation in TERA.  38 U.S.C. §1168.

In this case, neither of the Veteran's claimed disabilities meet all three requirements for service connection.  The record also does not indicate a continuity of symptoms from his time in service of these conditions.  In fact, the available post-service VA treatment records show the Veteran did not have his bone spurs surgically removed until December 2021 nor was he diagnosed with achilles tendonitis or tendonitis of the quadriceps until August 2023, over two decades after his service separation and outside of the applicable presumptive period.  This lengthy period, without complaint or treatment, is one piece of evidence that there has not been ongoing symptomatology and weighs heavily against the claims.  See Maxson v. Gober, 230 F.3d 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2000).  As such, service connection for bone spurs or tendonitis on a presumptive basis is not warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.  Lastly, it has been determined the Veteran's conditions do not warrant TERA examinations as there is no known association between those conditions and any potential in-service toxic exposure.

Regarding the claims above, the Board acknowledges and has considered the Veteran's statements asserting that his conditions began during his military service or are the result of his duties while aboard the USS Supply or working in shipyards.  However, while the Veteran is competent to report the symptoms of his disabilities, he is not competent to opine on matters requiring medical knowledge, such as the nature and etiology of his complex medical conditions.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Thus, while the Board has carefully considered the Veteran's statements about his symptoms, these statements must be weighed against the objective evidence of record, which does not indicate the Veteran's began during, were caused by, or are otherwise related to his military service on any basis.

It is important for the Veteran to understand that these medical findings provide highly probative evidence against this claim that the Board cannot, unfortunately, ignore, outweighing the Veteran's beliefs that his conditions are due to his time in service.

Regarding all the above, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  Except as otherwise noted, because the evidence is not in approximate balance or nearly equal, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55-57 (1990), Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).  The claims are denied.
