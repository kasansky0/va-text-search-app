REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from March 2003 to September 2004 and from May 2007 to July 2007, including service in Southwest Asia and additional Reserve service. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from September and December 2023 rating decisions of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of September 29, 2023 (all issues other than OSA) and December 15, 2023 (OSA) - the dates of the rating decisions on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after September 29, 2023 (regarding all issues other than OSA) and December 15, 2023 (regarding OSA), the Board did not consider it.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities, found in 38?C.F.R., Part 4.  The percentage ratings represent, as far as can practicably be determined, the average impairment in earning capacity in civil occupations.  38?U.S.C. §?1155.  The disability must be viewed in relation to its history.  38?C.F.R. §?4.1.  If two disability ratings are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38?C.F.R. §?4.7.  Reasonable doubt as to the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38?C.F.R. §?4.3.

The appeal period is from the effective date of service connection, or August 17, 2022.

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for allergic rhinitis is denied.

The Veteran's allergic rhinitis is rated pursuant to DC 6522, which provides a 10 percent rating for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side.  A maximum 30 percent rating is assigned for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis with polyps.  38 C.F.R. § 4.97.

Upon review of the totality of the record, the Board finds that a compensable rating for allergic rhinitis is not warranted at any point during the appeal period, as there is no evidence of more than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side, or nasal polyps.  In this regard, the September 2023 VA examination report is negative for any nasal obstruction, hypertrophy of turbinates, or polyps.  See September 2023 VA examination report, Part B.  There is no other relevant evidence dated during the appeal period.  Therefore, a compensable rating is precluded, and no other DCs may be considered.  See Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 337 (2015) (when a condition is specifically listed in the rating schedule, it may not be rated by analogy and should be rated under the diagnostic code that specifically pertains to it).

2. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for chronic bronchitis is denied.

The Veteran's chronic bronchitis is rated under DC 6600.  DC 6600 evaluates chronic bronchitis and provides a 10 percent rating for FEV-1 of 71 to 80 percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC of 71 to 80 percent, or; DLCO (SB) 66 to 80 percent predicted.  A 30 percent rating is assigned for FEV-1 of 56- to 70 percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC of 56 to 70 percent, or; DLCO (SB) 56 to 65 percent predicted.  A 60 percent rating is assigned for FEV-1 of 40 to 55 percent predicted, or; FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent, or; DLCO (SB) of 40 to 55 percent predicted, or; maximum oxygen consumption of 15 to 20 ml/kg/min (with cardiorespiratory limit).  A 100 percent rating is assigned for FEV-1 less than 40 percent of predicted value, or; FEV-1/FVC less than 40 percent, or; DLCO (SB) less than 40 percent predicted, or; maximum exercise capacity less than 15 ml/kg/min oxygen consumption (with cardiac or respiratory limitation), or; cor pulmonale (right heart failure), or; right ventricular hypertrophy, or; pulmonary hypertension (shown by Echo or cardiac catheterization), or; episode(s) of acute respiratory failure, or; requires outpatient oxygen therapy.  38 C.F.R. § 4.97.

Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are generally required to evaluate respiratory conditions.  38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d).  If the DLCO (SB) (Diffusion Capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide by the Single Breath Method) test is not of record, VA may evaluate based on alternative criteria so long as the examiner states why the test would not be useful or valid in a particular case.  38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(2).  When evaluating based on PFTs, post-bronchodilator results are used unless the post-bronchodilator results are poorer than the pre-bronchodilator results.  If so, the pre-bronchodilator results are used.  38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(5).  When there is a disparity between the results of different PFTs, so that the level of evaluation would differ depending on which test result is used, the test result that the examiner states most accurately reflects the level of disability is used.  38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(6).

At the September 2023 VA examination, the Veteran reported symptoms of shortness of breath with activity and coughing.  PTFs showed pre-bronchodilator readings of FEV-1 of 77 percent predicted and FEV-1/FCV of 84 percent, and post-bronchodilator readings of FEV-1 of 86 percent predicted and FEV-1/FCV of 76 percent.  The examiner determined that the FEV-1/FVC result most accurately reflected the Veteran's level of disability.  Although DLCO (SB) testing was not performed, the examiner explained that the testing was not indicated for the Veteran's condition.  

The above-cited findings do not allow for a compensable rating.  In this regard, while the Veteran's pre-bronchodilator FEV-1 result was 77 percent predicted, that result is not for application since the post-bronchodilator results are used in applying the rating criteria.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.96(d)(5).  Moreover, because his post-bronchodilator FEV-1/FCV result of 76 percent was poorer than his pre- bronchodilator FEV-1/FCV result of 84 percent, the pre-bronchodilator results are used.  Id.  There are no other relevant pulmonary function tests during the appeal period.  Accordingly, a compensable rating is not warranted, and no other DCs may be considered.  See Copeland, 27 Vet. App. 337. 

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38?U.S.C. §?1110;?38?C.F.R. §?3.303.  Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the current disability and the claimed in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi,?381 F.3d 1163?(Fed. Cir. 2004).

3. Entitlement to service connection for a back disability is granted. 

4. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee disability is granted. 

5. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee disability is granted. 

The Veteran is currently diagnosed with lumbar strain and bilateral knee strain.  See September 2023 VA examination reports.  Therefore, the first element of service connection is established.

Turning to the second element, in-service incurrence of a disease or injury, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) do not identify any complaints, treatment for, or diagnosis of a back or knee condition.  However, the Veteran attributed his back disability to the cumulative impact of wear and tear from service, to include from pulling on Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE).  He also reported that he spent most of his time squatting down to work on aircrafts during service and related his bilateral knee disability to the same.  His DD Form 214 shows that his military occupational specialty as a tactical aircraft maintenance apprentice and craftsman, and the Board finds his reports of back and knee pain to be consistent with the circumstances of his service and his military occupational specialty.  38 U.S.C. § 1154(a).  Thus, element two is also met. 

Regarding the last element, nexus, the only?competent?opinion of record is in favor of the claims.  Specifically, the September 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's back and bilateral knee disabilities were related to service.  In support, the examiner explained that chronic muscle strains could result from repetitive injuries when one stresses a muscle by doing the same motion over and over and determined that a nexus had been established between the Veteran's service and his back and knee disabilities.  This opinion is highly probative, as the examiner considered the Veteran's pertinent medical history and provided a cogent rationale.  There is no competent opinion to the contrary.  Accordingly, element three is met and service connection for back and bilateral knee disabilities are warranted. 

6. Entitlement to service connection for asthma is denied.

7. Entitlement to service connection for sinusitis is denied.

Service connection for asthma and sinusitis is not warranted because the competent and credible evidence indicates that the Veteran has not been diagnosed with either condition at any point just prior to or during the appeal period.  In this regard, the September 2023 VA examiner, who specifically considered the Veteran's reported history, determined that the Veteran did not have a current diagnosis of asthma or sinusitis based on an interview and examination of the Veteran and review of the claims file.  The medical evidence is otherwise negative for any complaints, treatment for, or diagnosis of asthma and sinusitis.  

While the Veteran is competent to report symptoms he observes, he is not competent to diagnose asthma or sinusitis, as this is a complex medical question that is beyond the ken of a layperson.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Thus, the competent and probative evidence of record is against the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for asthma and sinusitis based on a lack of a current disability, and hence, the first element of service connection is not met, and the claims fail on this basis alone.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992) (in the absence of proof of present disability there can be no successful claim).  Accordingly, since the competing evidence is not in approximate balance, or nearly equal, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is inapplicable, and the claim must be denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

REASONS FOR REMAND

8. Entitlement to service connection for hypertension is remanded. 

9. Entitlement to service connection for left foot/toe gout is remanded.

10. Entitlement to service connection for right foot/toe gout is remanded.

11. Entitlement to service connection for left ankle gout is remanded.

12. Entitlement to service connection for right ankle gout is remanded.

The September 2023 VA examiner found that the Veteran's hypertension was not related to his in-service toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).  However, the STRs that were of record prior to the rating decision on appeal reflect elevated blood pressure readings during the Veteran's active duty and Reserve service, and an opinion that considers this evidence has not been obtained and should be secured on remand.  An adequate TERA opinion addressing the Veteran's gout is not of record, as the September 2023 examiner merely noted review of the TERA memorandum but did not discuss its contents or how the Veteran's TERA is unrelated to gout. Moreover, given the September 2023 VA examiner's indication that gout may be secondary to the Veteran's hypertension and blood pressure medications, the record raises a theory of secondary service connection that should be addressed on remand.  These are pre-decisional duty to assist errors requiring addendum opinions on remand.

Furthermore, the failure to verify the Veteran's duty status, active duty for training (ADT) or inactive duty for training (IDT), on the dates he had elevated blood pressure readings and reported foot pain during his Reserve service, which are noted in the STRs that were of record prior to the rating decision on appeal, is also a pre-decisional duty to assist error that must corrected.

13. Entitlement to service connection for OSA is remanded.

The October 2023 and December 2023 VA examiners opined that the Veteran's OSA was not proximately due to his service-connected posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) but failed to provide an opinion on secondary service connection based on aggravation.  Furthermore, despite finding that a nexus could not be established between PTSD and OSA, the December 2023 examiner stated there was there was a medical nexus between the two conditions in rendering a TERA opinion.  The failure to obtain an adequate opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring an addendum opinion on remand. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Verify Veteran's duty status (ADT or IDT) for the following dates:

(a)	June 3, 2006 (report of foot pain, specifically inflamed joint of big toes);

(b)	February 16, 2007 (blood pressure of 124/90);

(c)	April 14, 2007 (blood pressure of 138/88);

(d)	August 1, 2009 (blood pressure of 130/90); 

(e)	March 6, 2010 (blood pressure of 140/92);

(f)	May 5, 2012 (report of left foot pain);

(g)	May 18, 2012 (record noting past medical history significant for gout);

(h)	May 30, 2012 (blood pressure of 141/92); and

(i)	February 2, 2013 (report of taking blood pressure medication).

2. Then obtain an addendum opinion addressing the etiology of the Veteran's hypertension, bilateral foot/toe and ankle gout, and OSA.  The claims file should be made available to and reviewed by the examiner.  No additional examination is necessary unless the examiner determines otherwise.  After a review of the claims file, the examiner is asked to address the following:

(a)	Is it at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability) that the Veteran's hypertension:

(1)	had its onset in or is otherwise related to active duty, to include as a result of documented elevated blood pressure readings therein?  See August 2003 (158/91) and August 2004 (142/94, 140/88) STRs.

(2)	had its onset during a verified period of ADT;

(3)	is the result of a disease or injury incurred during a verified period of ADT; or

(4)	is otherwise the result of an injury incurred during a verified period of IDT?

(b)	Is it at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability) that bilateral foot/toe gout had its onset in or is otherwise related to active duty, to include as a result of documented August 2003 report of bilateral foot pain therein?

(c)	Is it at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability) that gout of the bilateral foot/toe and ankles:

(1)	is related to the Veteran's participation in a TERA during service in Southwest Asia?  In addressing this question, the examiner must consider (i) the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments; and (ii) the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs of the Veteran;

(2)	had its onset during a verified period of ADT;

(3)	is the result of a disease or injury incurred during a verified period of ADT; or

(4)	is otherwise the result of an injury incurred during a verified period of IDT;

(5)	was caused by hypertension, to include medications used to treat the same, if related to service; or 

(6)	got worse due to hypertension, to include medications used to treat the same, if related to service?

(d)	Is it at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability) that the Veteran's OSA:

(1)	was caused by service-connected PTSD; or 

(2)	got worse due to service-connected PTSD?

A complete rationale should be provided for all opinions, citing to specific evidence of record and medical principles, as necessary.  If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).

If the inability to provide an opinion without resorting to speculation is due to a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), the AOJ should develop the claim to the extent it is necessary to cure any such deficiency.  If the inability to provide an opinion is due to the examiner's lack of requisite knowledge or training, then the AOJ should obtain an opinion from a medical professional with the knowledge and training needed to render such an opinion.
