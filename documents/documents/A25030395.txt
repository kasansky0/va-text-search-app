FINDING OF FACT

On April 1, 2025, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) was notified that the Veteran had died in March 2025.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the death of the Veteran, the Board has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of this appeal at this time. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1964 to September 1967.

These matters are before the Board on appeal from a December 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). The rating decision on appeal constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A hearing was scheduled for April 2025; however, the Veteran died before his hearing could be conducted and there is no substitute in the record.

Unfortunately, the Veteran died during the pendency of the appeal. As a matter of law, appellants' claims do not survive their deaths. Zevalkink v. Brown, 102 F.3d 1236, 1243-44 (Fed. Cir. 1996); Smith v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 330, 333-34 (1997); Landicho v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 42, 47 (1994). This appeal on the merits have become moot by virtue of the death of the Veteran and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); 38 C.F.R. § 20.1302.

There are, however, provisions in place to allow for an eligible person to take the appellant's place in his appeal in order to get a final decision. This process is called substitution. The request to be substituted must be filed within one year of the appellant's death. 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(b). To file a request for substitution, you may use VA Form 21P-0847, "Request for Substitution of Claimant Upon Death of Claimant," which can be found online here:

You may also submit the form directly to your nearest VA regional office. To find a VA regional office nearest you go to https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facilityType=benefits.

Please note that only certain persons are eligible for substitution. A person eligible for substitution includes "a living person who would be eligible to receive accrued benefits due to the claimant under section 5121(a) of this title...." 38 U.S.C. 5121A; 38 C.F.R. § 3.1010(a). There is a helpful factsheet that explains who is eligible for accrued benefits here:

https://benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/factsheets/general/Accrued.pdf.

Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed without prejudice.
