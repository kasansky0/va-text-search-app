2. The Veteran has already been assigned the earliest effective date possible for the award of a total disability rating due to individual unemployability. 

3. The Veteran has already been assigned the earliest effective date possible for the award of Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability status. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a disability rating of 100 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and moderate alcohol use disorder have been met for the period on appeal.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than February 15, 2023, for award of a total disability rating due to individual unemployability have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107(b), 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.155, 3.400, 4.16.

3. The criteria for an effective date earlier than February 15, 2023, for award of Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability status have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 5107(b) 5110; 38 CFR 3.807, 21.3021.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from March 2000 to June 2014, including service in Iraq.  The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) sincerely thanks the Veteran for his many years of honorable service to our country in a time of war.

This case comes before the Board on appeal from an April 2023 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the October 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the April 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an increased rating of 100 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and moderate alcohol use disorder is granted.

The Veteran asserts that his posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) manifests with symptoms severe enough to warrant a rating in excess of 70 percent.

The Veteran first filed a claim for service connection for PTSD in October 2017, which was received by VA on November 15, 2017.  See October 2017 VA Form 21-526EZ.  In a February 2018 rating decision, the AOJ granted the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD, evaluated as 70% disabling effective November 15, 2017.  See February 2018 Rating Decision.

No appeal, higher level review, or supplemental claim was filed within the year following this rating decision; no relevant records were associated with the file or within the constructive possession of VA.  Therefore, the February 2018 rating decision is final.

Over two years later the Veteran filed a claim for several new, unrelated conditions, which also included an increased rating claim for PTSD.  See April 2020 VA Form 21-526EZ.  The Veteran's increased rating claim was denied in a March 2021 rating decision.  See March 2021 Rating Decision.

The Veteran was then given a new VA examination for PTSD and the AOJ issued another rating decision, again denying the Veteran an increased rating.  See July 2021 Rating Decision.

No appeal, higher level review, or supplemental claim was filed within the year following this rating decision; no relevant records were associated with the file or within the constructive possession of VA.  Therefore, the July 2021 rating decision is final.

On February 15, 2023 the Veteran filed a claim for individual unemployability based off his service connected PTSD and was subsequently given another VA examination for PTSD.  See February 2023 VA Form 21-8940.  The Veteran was again denied an increased rating for PTSD in an April 2023 rating decision, which the Veteran has timely appealed to the Board.  See October 2023 VA Form 10182.

The Board therefore finds the period on appeal stems from February 15, 2023 to include consideration of the one-year look back period, but no earlier.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) and are intended to represent the average impairment of earning capacity resulting from disability.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  Disabilities must be reviewed in relation to their history.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  A claimant may experience multiple distinct degrees of disability that might result in different levels of compensation from the time the increased rating claim was filed until a final decision is made.  Thus, separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found - a practice known as "staged" ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007). 

The Veteran's PTSD is evaluated under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula).  38 C.F.R. § 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411.  Under the General Formula, the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria.  Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.  The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages.  Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating.  Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

A 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.  Id.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  Id.

The issue in this appeal is therefore whether the Veteran's PTSD symptoms caused the level of impairment required for a disability rating greater than 70 percent during the period on appeal.  For the reasons explained below, the Board finds that an increased rating of 100 percent is warranted.

There is medical evidence during the period on appeal which directly addresses the Veteran's PTSD.   

A March 2023 VA examiner described, in detail, the Veteran's occupational and social impairment due to his PTSD.  

Regarding the Veteran's occupation impairment, the examiner noted that the Veteran has had at least 20 or 30 jobs since becoming self-employed (after the employer he previously worked for fired him "when he blacked out while drinking on the job" and paramedics had to be called) "but quit about half of them when he saw a firing coming and was fired from the others." See March 2023 VA Examination.  The Veteran has typically been fired for excessive absences, including excessive absences due to taking time off to binge drink or recover from binge drinking, and for "interpersonal conflicts" at work.  Id.  The examiner noted that the Veteran "does not do well under supervision or working as part of a team."  Id. 

The Veteran typically cannot work more than "3 days out of 2 weeks, stating that sometimes he has to recover from a drinking binge in between or sleep disturbances and panic attacks impact his capacity to work."  Id.  When the Veteran does work, he "has to take jobs that are time limited and not highly complex in order to maintain concentration and motivation to complete them" and he has to "not be in situations where interpersonal conflicts can easily arise." Id.  The Veteran reported that he feels that his "interpersonal outbursts" have worsened, along with his depression and panic attacks.  Id. 

Here the Board notes that the Veteran has been granted individual unemployability due to his PTSD, with the AOJ finding "your employment history, combined with your education, skill, and training shows that you are unable to maintain substantially gainful employment" adding that although the Veteran is physically healthy, his mental health effectively prevents him from working.  See April 2023 Rating Decision.

The Veteran reports that he typically binge-drinks "for about 3 days in a row."  See March 2023 VA Examination.  The examiner noted that when the Veteran drinks he does not complete basic activities of daily living.  Id.  The examiner also noted that the Veteran appeared to be neglecting his personal appearance and hygiene.  Id. 

The Veteran recently took two college courses, which he did well in, but then dropped out of school due to his depression and frustration and has not attempted to complete his studies.  Id.  The Veteran also reports that the majority of the time he cannot drive, and his wife has to drive him, because driving is a PTSD trigger.  Id.  The Veteran has no hobbies and reports that simply being out in public, as well as being in crowds, triggers his PTSD symptoms.  Id.  The Veteran experiences frequent flashbacks, panic attacks, nightmares, and hypervigilance, and often engages in checking locks.  Id.

As for the Veteran's social impairment, the Veteran has lost custody of both his minor children due to his behavior.  Id.  The Veteran no longer has any relationship with his mother or with his sisters due this situation.  Id.  The Veteran is not involved in his youngest son's life and was fully estranged from his older son for at least two years.  Id.  His current relationship with his older son is difficult, because the older son "does not feel as though the Veteran loves him and is struggling and currently in counseling."  Id.  

The Veteran lives with his wife, whom he describes as "understanding" but also describes their communication as "difficult" because of frequent arguments (including arguments about his drinking) his anger, and his withdrawal to drink.  Id.  The Veteran's adult stepson also lives in the home, but the VA examiner noted that the Veteran describes that relationship as "he can tell that [the stepson] is holding resentments toward the Veteran for his behavior."  Id. 

The VA examiner also noted the Veteran has experienced suicidal ideation, although the Veteran clearly denied intent or plans to carry out self-harm, adding that his "responsibilities are a strong deterrent" and that he has the VA Crisis Line number.  See March 2023 VA Examination.

The examiner concluded that the Veteran experiences "impairments in most major areas of functioning to include social, occupational, parental, familial, marital and interpersonal domains" and highlighted the Veteran's "impaired judgement as noted by his drinking while at work and drinking despite exacerbation of his depression as well as deterioration of his relationships.  Id.

Taking a holistic view of the evidence of record the Board finds that the Veteran's symptoms most closely correlate with total occupational and social impairment.  The Veteran consistently demonstrates grossly inappropriate behavior (such as his frequent binge drinking, drinking at work, and his repeated interpersonal conflicts in work environments), grossly impaired judgement, and intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene.)  These symptoms are evidenced on record for the entire period on appeal and are consistent with a 100 percent rating under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411.  

Put simply, the evidence of record shows that Veteran's PTSD and alcohol use disabilities have impaired every area of his life.

Resolving all doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board therefore finds that the evidence both for and against his claim is at least approximately balanced; therefore, the claim for entitlement to an increased rating of 100 percent for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and moderate alcohol use disorder is hereby GRANTED.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (2021).

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 15, 2023 for individual unemployability is denied.  

3. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than February 15, 2023 for Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability status is denied.

The Veteran seeks an effective date earlier than February 15, 2023 for his award of total disability rating due to individual unemployability (TDIU) and for the award of Dependents' Education Assistance based on permanent and total disability status.

A TDIU is a form of increased rating claim, and, therefore, the effective date rules for increased compensation claims apply.  See Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000).

For claims for higher ratings, in general, the effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if an application is received within one year from that date.  Otherwise, the effective date will be the date of VA receipt of the claim for increase, or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

The Veteran first filed a claim for TDIU on February 15, 2023.  See February 2023 VA Form 21-9840.  In an April 2023 rating decision, the AOJ awarded the Veteran TDIU effective February 15, 2023-the date VA received the Veteran's claim.  See April 2023 Rating Decision.  The Veteran timely appealed that rating decision to the Board.  See October 2023 VA Form 10182.

Generally, the earliest effective date of a claim is the date of receipt of the claim, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a)-(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).  In the Veteran's case the later of these two dates is February 15, 2023, which is the date the Veteran filed, and the same date VA received, a claim for TDIU.

The Veteran's award of TDIU is based off his PTSD disability, which is his only service connected disability.  As explained in detail above, the Veteran has now been awarded an increased rating for his PTSD.  

The question before the Board is therefore whether there it is factually ascertainable that an increase in the Veteran's disability occurred within one year prior to February 15, 2023 (the date VA received the Veteran's application for TDIU).  38 U.S.C. § 5110(a), (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997).

As explained in detail above, there is no question that at least by March 2023 the Veteran had experienced an increase in his PTSD disability.  However, the Board finds that there simply is no evidence of record to suggest any factually ascertainable date of disability increase specifically in the one year prior to February 15, 2023.

The only medical and lay evidence of record which addresses the Veteran's PTSD in the one year period prior to February 15, 2023 is the Veteran's March 2023 VA Examination and the Veteran's May 2023 Lay Witness statement, which the Veteran submitted in conjunction with his application for TDIU.  

Both the VA examination and the Veteran's lay witness statement make clear that the Veteran's PTSD symptoms worsened, but the only discussion of specific dates is a reference to the Veteran believing his symptoms had worsened since his last VA exam in June 2021 and a statement by the Veteran that he has noticed several symptoms worsening "in the last twelve months."  See March 2023 VA Examination; March 2023 VA Form 21-10210. 

In other words, there is no factually ascertainable evidence that this increase in disability took place specifically in the one year preceding the Veteran's February 15, 2023 filing, and there are no contentions of record as to any specific date of increase in disability.

There is no evidence of record to suggest that the Veteran ever filed, or ever intended to file, a claim for service connection for Dependents' Educational Assistance.  Instead, VA inferred an informal claim based on the Veteran's award of TDIU-granted effective February 15, 2023-which granted him permanent and total disability status, the basis of an award of Dependents' Educational Assistance based on permanent and total disability.  The VA did this on the Veteran's behalf to give him the maximum benefit available, even when the Veteran had not sought this benefit on his own behalf.  The effective date of the claim, February 15, 2023 is the date the Veteran's claim arose- i.e., the date of the initial claim and the date entitlement arose are in fact the same date.

Put simply, the Veteran has been awarded both TDIU and Dependent's Education Assistance effective as of the earliest dates assignable.  38 U.S.C. § 5110.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply as the evidence persuasively weighs against the claims for an earlier effective date.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).  The effective dates for the Veteran's award of TDIU and for the award of Dependents' Education Assistance are correct.  Accordingly, the Veteran's claims must hereby be DENIED.
