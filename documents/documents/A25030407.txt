ORDER

Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 50 percent following a temporary evaluation of 100 percent because of hospitalization over 21 days, is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In February 2025 Third Party Correspondence, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the matter, the Veteran's representative submitted a motion to withdraw all Issues under docket H210510-158152 & BVA Hearing pursuant to 38 CFR § 20.704(e) - Rule 704.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 50 percent following a temporary evaluation of 100 percent because of hospitalization over 21 days, by the appellant (or his or her authorized representative) have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. Id. 

In Third Party Correspondence, dated February 14, 2025, the Veteran's attorney stated:

The Veteran withdraws his claim and appeal for the issue "A temporary evaluation of 100 percent has been assigned effective March 3, 2019, because of hospitalization over 21 days. An evaluation of 50 percent is assigned from April 2, 2019."

This issue has since been awarded and therefore is moot. Please cancel and withdraw the hearing accordingly. 

The Veteran has consented to this motion.

In the present case, the appellant, through his attorney, has withdrawn this appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
