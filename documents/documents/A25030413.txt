ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea secondary to asthma is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's sleep apnea is proximately due to service-connected asthma.  

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for sleep apnea as secondary to service-connected asthma are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 2009 to August 2013. 

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to service connection for sleep apnea. 

The Veteran asserts that her sleep apnea was caused or aggravated by her service-connected PTSD and asthma. See November 2023 Statement in Support of Claim. 

Legal Criteria

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.?38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131;?38 C.F.R. § 3.303?(a). Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all?of?the?evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.?38 C.F.R. § 3.303?(d). Direct service connection may not be granted without?evidence?of?a current disability; in-service incurrence or aggravation?of?a disease or injury; and a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disease or injury.?Id.; see also Caluza v. Brown,?7 Vet. App. 498, 506?(1995) aff'd,?78 F.3d 604?(Fed. Cir. 1996). 

Secondary service connection may be granted for a disability that is due to, or aggravated by, a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. In order to prevail on the issue of entitlement to secondary service connection, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) nexus evidence establishing a connection between the service-connected disability and the current disability. See Wallin v. West, 11?Vet. App.?509, 512 (1998). 

Factual Background

The Veteran is currently service connected for asthma, effective August 2013, and PTSD, effective April 2019. 

In December 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA Toxic Exposure Risk Activity examination for sleep apnea. The examiner noted the Veteran's diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea through a sleep study in November 2020.  The examiner opined that the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is less likely than not caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activity of daily exposure to burn pits and airborne hazards, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. 

In March 2024, the Veteran was afforded a VA addendum opinion for her claim that her sleep apnea was secondary to her PTSD and asthma. The examiner gave an opinion on each service-connected condition, opining that the Veteran's sleep apnea is at least as likely as not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's asthma and that the Veteran's sleep apnea is less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's PTSD. The examiner explained that obstructive sleep apnea and asthma are "highly prevalent chronic respiratory disorders" that "feature a reciprocal interaction whereby each disease impacts the severity of the other." The examiner also explained that asthma-controlling medications are factors that predispose patients with asthma to obstructive sleep apnea. These opinions and explanations were bolstered by cites to published medical journals. The examiner also gave an explanation why sleep apnea was not related to PTSD, as there is no pathophysiological and causational link between the two conditions. 

Analysis

The Veteran has a current diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. See December 2023 VA examination and November 2020 sleep study. The Veteran is currently service connected for asthma, effective August 2013. See March 2024 rating decision. The March 2024 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's sleep apnea is at least as likely as not proximately due to the service-connected asthma. Upon review of the record, all three elements of secondary service connection have been met. See Wallin, 11?Vet. App. at 512. Accordingly, the Board finds that service connection for sleep apnea is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
