ORDER

An initial compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

An initial rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran's bilateral hearing loss exhibits hearing loss manifested by hearing acuity of no worse than Level I in the right ear and no worse than Level I in the left ear. 

2. Throughout the appeal period, the Veteran's tinnitus has been assigned a 10 percent rating, the maximum schedular rating authorized under DC 6260; an unusual or exceptional disability picture has not been presented.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss have not been met. 38?U.S.C. §§?1155, 5107;?38?C.F.R. §§?4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.85, 4.86, Diagnostic Code (DC) 6100.

2. The criteria for an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.87, DC 6260.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from October 1974 to May 1978 and from October 1980 to May 1981.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in July 2022 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the February 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board notes that the Veteran submitted an evidentiary statement with the February 2023 Notice Disagreement which cannot be considered as the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. In December 2024, VA sent written correspondence providing the Veteran, and her representative at the time, the opportunity to change from the Direct Review docket in order for such evidence to be considered. VA did not receive any response from the Veteran. 

In January 2025, the Veteran retained a new representative. In February 2025, VA sent written correspondence acknowledging such change and providing the new representative with notice that the Veteran has an appeal pending before the Board. 

As a final matter, if the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the pertinent claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss.

Disability ratings are determined by applying a schedule of ratings that is based on average impairment of earning capacity. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.?38?U.S.C. §?1155;?38 C.F.R., Part 4. Each disability must be viewed in relation to its history and the limitation of activity imposed by the disabling condition should be emphasized.?38?C.F.R. §?4.1. Examination reports are to be interpreted considering the whole recorded history, and each disability must be considered from the point of view of the veteran working or seeking work.?38?C.F.R. §?4.2. All reasonable doubt will be resolved in the claimant's favor.?38?C.F.R. §?4.3. Where there is a question as to which of two disability evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation is to be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating is to be assigned.?38?C.F.R. §?4.7.

For the entire appeal period, such disability has been evaluated as noncompensably disabling pursuant to DC 6100.?38?C.F.R. §?4.85, 4.86. In this regard, ratings of hearing loss range from noncompensable to 100 percent based on organic impairment of hearing acuity as measured by the results of speech discrimination tests combined with the average hearing threshold levels as measured by pure tone audiometry tests in the frequencies 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 cycles per second. To rate the degree of disability for service-connected hearing loss, the Rating Schedule has established eleven auditory acuity levels, designated from Level I, for essentially normal acuity, through Level XI, for profound deafness.?38?C.F.R. §?4.85(h), Table VI. The assignment of disability ratings for hearing impairment is derived by a mechanical application of the Rating Schedule to the numeric designations assigned after audiometric evaluations are rendered. Lendenmann v. Principi,?3?Vet. App.?345, 349?(1992).

The criteria for rating hearing impairment use controlled speech discrimination tests (Maryland CNC) together with the results of pure tone audiometry tests. These results are then charted on Table VI, or Table VIA in exceptional cases as described in?38?C.F.R. §?4.86, and Table VII, as set out in the Rating Schedule.?38?C.F.R. §?4.85. An exceptional pattern of hearing loss occurs when the pure tone threshold at each of the 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 frequencies is 55 decibels or more, or when the pure tone threshold is 30 decibels or less at 1000 Hertz and 70 decibels or more at 2000 Hertz.?38?C.F.R. §?4.86.

Here, the relevant medical evidence includes the VA examination report dated in July 2022. 

On VA examination in July 2022, the Veteran's Maryland CNC Word List speech recognition score and pure tone thresholds, in decibels, were as follows:

July 2022	HERTZ

 	1000	2000	3000	4000	Avg	CNC

RIGHT	25	20	25	40	27.5	100%

LEFT	20	10	30	40	25	100%

Such audiometry test results reflect Level I hearing acuity in the right ear pursuant to Table VI; and Level I hearing acuity in the left ear. Applying the percentage ratings for hearing impairment found in Table VII, such impairment results in a noncompensable rating. At such examination, the Veteran reported that she has difficulty understanding speech, especially in the presence of noise. 

To the extent that the Veteran has continued to assert that her bilateral hearing loss is more severe than currently evaluated, the Board observes that the Veteran, while competent to report symptoms capable of lay observation, such as an inability to hear speech, is not competent to report that her hearing acuity is of sufficient severity to warrant a compensable rating percent under VA's tables for rating hearing loss disabilities. Specifically, such an opinion requires medical expertise (training in evaluating hearing impairment), which she has not been shown to possess. See Davidson v. Shinseki,?581 F.3d 1313?(Fed. Cir. 2009); Jandreau v. Nicholson,?492 F.3d 1372?(Fed. Cir. 2007); Buchanan v. Nicholson,?451 F.3d 1331?(Fed. Cir. 2006); Charles v. Principi,?16?Vet. App.?370?(2002); Woehlaert v. Nicholson,?21?Vet. App.?456?(2007). 

Despite the foregoing, the Board acknowledges the Veteran may feel as though the state of her hearing and the difficulties associated with her hearing loss are not properly compensated. While the Board is sympathetic to the Veteran's contentions that she is entitled to a compensable rating due to requiring hearing aids, the rating criteria considers such impact on a Veteran's life. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017). Even after considering such effects of the disability on her daily life, the Board finds the criteria for a compensable rating in are not met. See Lendenmann, supra.?Thus, her complete disability picture is compensated under the rating schedule. 

Therefore, the Board finds that a compensable rating for bilateral hearing loss is not warranted at any time during the pendency of the appeal. In reaching such determination, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine. However, the probative, competent evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claim.

2. Entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus. 

The Veteran contends that she is entitled to a compensable rating for tinnitus. 

In the July 2022 rating decision, the AOJ granted the Veteran service connection for tinnitus, rated as 10 percent disabling from April 29, 2022. The Veteran is appealing for an increased rating for the tinnitus. 

The Board notes that a 10 percent rating is the maximum schedular allowance under DC 6260 and there is no provision for assignment of a separate 10 percent evaluation for tinnitus of each ear. See Smith v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006).

Thus, the question for the Board is whether an extraschedular rating for tinnitus is warranted in this case.

Consideration of an extraschedular rating requires a three-step inquiry. The first question is whether the schedular rating criteria adequately contemplate the veteran's disability picture. If the schedular evaluation does not contemplate the level of disability and symptomatology shown and is found inadequate, then the second inquiry is whether the exceptional disability picture exhibits other related factors, such as marked interference with employment or frequent periods of hospitalization. See Thun v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 111 (2008). The first Thun element compares a claimant's symptoms to the rating criteria, while the second addresses the resulting effects of those symptoms. Thus, the first and second Thun elements, although interrelated, involve separate and distinct analyses. Yancy v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 484, 495 (2016). If the veteran's disability picture meets the second inquiry, then the third step is to refer the case to the Director of Compensation Services to determine whether an extraschedular rating is warranted. See Thun, 22 Vet. App. 111.

In regard to the first element, comparison of the Veteran's symptoms and associated functional impairment does not show that the rating criteria are inadequate to describe her disability picture. The evidence of record before the AOJ at the time of the rating decision reflects that at the July 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported intermittent ringing in both ears that is high-pitched and daily. The July 2022 VA examiner noted that the Veteran's tinnitus does not impact ordinary conditions of daily life, including her ability to work. A careful review of VA treatment records reveals no complaints related to tinnitus. The Board finds that the Veteran's reported effects are contemplated by the schedular rating criteria. Notably, in Doucette v. Shulkin, the Court made clear that a DC need not list every word or type of symptom to contemplate a type of functional effect. 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017). For instance, problems with hearing sounds in crowds, televisions, or telephones are not listed in the DC for hearing loss but are nonetheless contemplated because they are the actual effects of the hearing loss in daily life. Doucette, supra. Here, although in the context of a tinnitus extraschedular rating claim, the Doucette decision by extension shows that the symptoms of the Veteran's tinnitus, and their functional effects, are contemplated by the rating schedule for evaluating the disability. Thus, the threshold issue under Thun is not met, and further consideration of an extraschedular rating is not warranted.

The Veteran is reminded that the Board only considered the evidence of record at the time of the July 2022 AOJ decision on appeal based on her election on the Notice of Disagreement. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the July 2022 AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. As stated in the introduction to this decision, if the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence; if the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. 

In sum, the Veteran's service-connected tinnitus has been assigned the maximum schedular rating pursuant to DC 6260. As there is no legal basis upon which to award a higher rating, the Veteran's appeal must be denied. Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).
