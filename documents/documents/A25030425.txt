ORDER

Entitlement to more than 36 months of education benefits under Chapter 35, Title 38 U.S. Code, also known as the Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A September 2017 rating decision granted service connection for cause of the Veteran's death; basic eligibility to DEA benefits was also granted.

2. The Appellant first enrolled in a program of education using DEA benefits after August 1, 2018; she is not entitled to an aggregate period in excess of 36 months of DEA benefits.

3. The Appellant exhausted 36 months of benefits as of April 2023.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to more than 36 months of DEA benefits are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3511; 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.3020, 21.3021; Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, Pub. L. 115-48, (enacted Aug. 16, 2017).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1968 to January 1970.  The Appellant is the Veteran's spouse.  The March 2023 VA Form 10182 appeals a February 2023 decision letter by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denying entitlement to more Chapter 35 benefits than the 36 months already used.  The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) notes there is no corresponding February 2023 letter; however, a January 2023 decision letter noted the Appellant will have exhausted her Chapter 35 benefits as of March 2023, and the arguments made within the March 2023 VA Form 10182 correspond to this decision letter.  Thus, the Board will proceed with adjudication.

The Appellant requested the Board conduct a direct review of the evidence considered by the RO.  See March 2023 VA Form 10182.  Under the direct review docket, the Board will consider the same record as that before the RO at the time of the January 2023 decision letter.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the January 2023 decision letter.  Id.  If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  If the Appellant would like VA to consider any evidence that was added to the claims file that the Board could not consider, the Appellant may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Basic eligibility for Chapter 35 DEA benefits is established in one of several ways, including being a spouse of a veteran who has a permanent total service-connected disability, or who has died as a result of a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.  In this case, the Appellant's potential eligibility for chapter 35 DEA benefits derives from her status as the legally recognized spouse of the Veteran, who had a permanent and total service-connected disability and who, unfortunately, died from a service-connected disability.  See January 2017 and September 2017 rating decisions.

In August 2017, the President signed into law the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, Pub. L. 115-48, which specifically amended 38 U.S.C. § 3511 concerning the duration of educational assistance to DEA benefits.  Specifically, the amendment stated that each eligible person who first enrolls in a program of education using such entitlement before August 1, 2018 will receive up to 45 months of benefits; whereas, each eligible person who first enrolls in a program of education using such entitlement on or after August 1, 2018, will receive up to 36 months of benefits.  38 U.S.C. § 3511; Pub. L. 115-48, § 202, 131 Stat. 989 (2017).

The record reflects the Appellant first applied for Chapter 35 benefits in July 2018.  See July 2018 VA Form 22-5490.  In August 2018, the RO provided the Appellant with a certificate of eligibility noting she would receive a total of 45 months of Chapter 35 benefits if her courses began prior to August 1, 2018, but only 36 months if her courses began on or after August 1, 2018.  The Appellant began a course of study in March 2019.  See April 2019 VA Form 22-1999.  As her program of education began after August 1, 2018, the Appellant was only entitled to 36 months of benefits.  The Board is unable to grant the Appellant more than 36 months of Chapter 35 benefits as it is bound by the applicable law and regulations and does not have authority to grant benefits on an equitable basis.  38 U.S.C. §§ 503, 7104(c).

The Appellant used Chapter 35 benefits from April 2019 to April 2023 and exhausted her entitlement, using 36 months after a school certifying official last certified courses from January 2023 to April 2023 at Walden University.  See January 2023 VA Form 22-1999.  The Appellant is not entitled to more than 36 months of Chapter 35 benefits.

The Appellant does not contend that she did not use all 36 months of Chapter 35 education benefits or that VA miscalculated her entitlement.  Rather, the Appellant contends completing her bachelor's degree took longer than planned, because she changed her major from cybersecurity to business administration when the first school she attended, Independence University, closed in August 2021.  See March 2023 VA Form 10182.  The Appellant states she was unable to transfer all completed credits from Independence University to her new school, Walden University.  Id.  The Board notes that in August 2021, the RO provided the Appellant a letter stating she may be eligible for a restoration of benefits due to the school's closure and requested she submit VA Form 22-0989, requesting restoration of educational benefit entitlement due to the school's closure.

The Colmery Act also restored certain educational assistance benefits for individuals affected by closures of educational institutions.  See The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistant Act of 2017, Pub. L. 115-48, § 109, 131 Stat. 977 (2017); see also 38 U.S.C. § 3699.  Benefits may be restored to an eligible individual if the evidence reflects that the individual was unable to complete such course or program as a result of the closure of the educational institution, and the individual did not receive credit or lost training time, toward completion of the program of education being so pursued.  38 U.S.C. § 3699.  Effective August 1, 2021, VA will restore entitlement for an entire program of education, not just the last term, quarter, or semester if an individual who qualifies was not able to transfer at least 12 credits to a new school.  See 38 U.S.C. § 3699(c)(2)(A); see also The Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020, Pub. L. 116-315, § 1021(b), 134 Stat. 4937 (2021) (providing that 38 U.S.C. §3699(c)(2)(A) shall take effect on August 1, 2021).

As of the January 2023 decision letter under appeal, the Appellant had not filed VA Form VA Form 22-0989, requesting restoration of educational benefit entitlement due to Independence University's closure.  The Board strongly encourages the Appellant submit a completed VA Form 22-0989 to the RO.  If she is eligible for restoration of some (or all) benefits used while at Independence University, she will receive Chapter 35 entitlement back that she could use toward the pursuit of a program of education.  Unfortunately, entitlement to restoration of Chapter 35 benefits is not currently before the Board.

The Appellant stated she will have completed her bachelors in April 2023, when her benefit runs out, but she requested additional Chapter 35 benefits to continue her education with a master's program that she could finish in under one year.  See March 2023 VA Form 10182.  Although the Board commends the Appellant for furthering her education and is certainly sympathetic to her position, the Board is bound by the applicable law and regulations and does not have authority to grant benefits on an equitable basis.  38 U.S.C. §§ 503, 7104(c).  As the law and not the evidence is dispositive in this case, the benefit of the doubt provisions set forth in 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b) do not apply and the claim must be denied as a matter of law.  See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).
