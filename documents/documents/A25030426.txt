FINDING OF FACT

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeals regarding entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches, PTSD, tinnitus, visual impairment, and inguinal hernia have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from July 2011 to October 2011.

The rating decisions on appeal was issued in January 2024 and July 2024 and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the July 26, 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

In a July 22, 2024, VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request for Higher-Level Review (HLR), the Veteran requested review of his claims of entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches, PTSD, tinnitus, visual impairment, and inguinal hernia.  Subsequently, the Veteran submitted his VA Form 10182 on July 26, 2024, for the same issues while the July 22, 2024, HLR request was still pending.

Under AMA, there are three review lanes: Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, and Board Appeal.  If a request for review under one of these three lanes is pending, a claimant may not file a request for review under a different lane without first withdrawing the pending review request.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2500 (b), (d), (e); 20.205.  No such withdrawal has taken place here.

Accordingly, due to the prohibition against concurrent election, the appeals for entitlement to service connection for migraine headaches, PTSD, tinnitus, visual 

?

impairment, and inguinal hernia are dismissed as a matter of law.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.201, 3.2500.
