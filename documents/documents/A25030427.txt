ORDER

A compensable initial rating for hidradenocarcinoma, status-post excision, is denied. 

Service connection for hypertension is denied

Service connection for infertility is denied.

REMANDED

Service connection for diabetes mellitus type 2 (diabetes) is remanded.  

Service connection for anemia is remanded.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The residual of the hidradenocarcinoma, status-post excision, is a 10 square centimeter scar that is not painful or unstable and does not limit function.  

2. The claimed hypertension was not incurred until years after service and is not etiologically related to service. 

3. The Veteran does not have a diagnosis of infertility.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for a compensable initial rating for hidradenocarcinoma status-post excision are not met.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.118 Diagnostic Code 7818.

2. The criteria for service connection for hypertension are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1131, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.3.07, 3.309.

3. The criteria for service connection for infertility are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. 

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from December 1985 to February 1990. 

Increased Rating

In a November 2023 rating decision, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for residuals of left knee hidradenocarcinoma and assigned a noncompensable rating for scar effective August 10, 2022.  In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  

In a December 2023 letter, VA informed the Veteran that any evidence included in the additional documents submitted with the VA form 10182 could not be considered unless the Veteran changed the Board appeal request.  A change was not requested.  If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Disability ratings are determined by the application of rating criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (38 C.F.R. Part 4) based on the average impairment of earning capacity.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  The left knee hidradenocarcinoma, status-post excision, is rated under Diagnostic Code 7818, which rates malignant skin neoplasms other than malignant melanoma.  

Under DC 7818, malignant skin neoplasms (other than malignant melanoma) are to be rated under disfigurement of the head, face, or neck; scars; or impairment of function.  The Note in Diagnostic Code 7818 provides that if a skin malignancy requires therapy that is comparable to that used for systemic malignancies, i.e., systemic chemotherapy, X-ray therapy more extensive than to the skin, or surgery more extensive than wide local excision, a 100-percent evaluation will be assigned from the date of onset of treatment, and will continue, with a mandatory VA examination six months following the completion of such antineoplastic treatment, and any change in evaluation based upon that or any subsequent examination will be subject to the provisions of §3.105(e) of this chapter.  If there has been no local recurrence of metastasis, evaluation will then be made on residuals.  If treatment is confined to the skin, the provisions for a 100-percent evaluation do not apply.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, Diagnostic Code 7818.

In January 2022, the Veteran underwent wide local excision of the hidradenocarcinoma; she was not provided systemic treatment.  Pursuant to Diagnostic Code 7818, the hidradenocarcinoma should be rated under disfigurement of the head, face, or neck, scar, or impairment of function.  The hidradenocarcinoma did not involve the head, face, or neck; thus, Diagnostic Code 7800, which considers disfigurement and scars of the head, face, and neck, is not applicable.  

Diagnostic Code 7801 rates scars not of the head, face, or neck, that are associated with underlying soft tissue damage based on the area affected.  Diagnostic Code 7802 rates scars not of the head, face, or neck, that are not associated with underlying tissue damage.  Diagnostic Code 7804 rates scars that are unstable or painful based on the number of scars.  The diagnostic code defines an unstable scar as one where, for any reason, there is frequent loss of covering of skin over the scar.  Diagnostic Code 7805 states that any disabling effects not considered in a rating provided under diagnostic codes 7800-04 should be rated under an appropriate diagnostic code.  

An August 2022 VA examination record reports that the Veteran had a left knee scar status-post excision of the mass.  The scar was not painful or unstable, and there was not underlying soft tissue damage.  The Veteran denied symptoms of the scar.  The scar affected approximately 10 square centimeters, measuring 10 centimeters by 1 centimeter.  The scar did not limit function.  

After review of the record, the Board finds a compensable rating is not warranted for the hidradenocarcinoma, status-post excision.  As noted above, the record does not indicate that the hidradenocarcinoma required therapy that was comparable to that used for systemic malignancy, and the residual scar is not painful or unstable, and does not affect function or involve the requisite area for a compensable rating.  There is no indication of a residual symptom other than scar based on which a compensable rating could be assigned.  In making this determination, the Board notes that service connection is separately in effect for left knee disorder characterized by symptoms including pain, stiffness, and swelling.  

In conclusion, the Board finds that the Veteran has not specifically contended, nor does the record suggest, that this service-connected disability contributes to preclude her from securing or following a substantially gainful occupation, or otherwise causes an exceptional or unusual disability picture not adequately contemplated by the applicable rating criteria.  This claim accordingly raises no other issues.  See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366, 369-70 (2017); Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).

Service Connection

In an October 2023 rating decision, the AOJ denied service connection for anemia, diabetes, hypertension, and infertility.  In the December 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  The Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  In a December 2023 letter, VA informed the Veteran that any evidence included in the additional documents submitted with the VA form 10182 could not be considered unless the Veteran changed the Board appeal request.  A change was not requested.  

Service connection may be established for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  

Service connection may be granted for any disease initially diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).  Where a veteran served for at least 90 days during a period of war and manifests hypertension to a degree of 10 percent within one year from the date of termination of such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred or aggravated in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309.

Hypertension

For rating purposes, hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension must be confirmed by readings taken two or more times on at least three different days.  Hypertension is defined as diastolic blood pressure predominantly 90 mm. or greater and isolated systolic hypertension means that systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160 mm. or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

Service treatment records reveal no finding or history of hypertension, service examination records dated in July 1989 and February 1990 and a February 1991 Department of Defense examination record reveal no diagnosis of hypertension. The Veteran denied high or low blood pressure at examination in July 1989, February 1990, and February 1991.  

A March 2004 private treatment record, more than a decade following service, reveals blood pressure readings of 154/100 and 132/100.  The Veteran was told to follow-up with her primary care physician about hypertension.  

A July 2008 VA treatment record reports that the Veteran was recently diagnosed with hypertension on July 25, 2008, when systolic pressure was 200 mm.  A September 2008 treatment record reveals a "new problem" of hypertension with an onset of "sev[eral] weeks."  A February 2010 private treatment record reveals diagnosis of hypertension with a reported onset of "several years" earlier.  

A July 2022 VA examination record reveals diagnosis of hypertension.  The record reveals the Veteran's history that the hypertension was diagnosed in 2008 after her blood pressure was randomly taken and shown to be so high that emergency treatment was needed.  The examiner determined the hypertension was not incurred in or caused by service.  The examiner explained that the Veteran was diagnosed with hypertension many years after service and that the medical records did not show chronicity of care from discharge to the initial diagnosis.  

In a March 2023 VA medical opinion, a clinician determined the hypertension was not caused by in-service toxic exposure risk activities, which included exposure to Otto fuel, asbestos, and toxic chemicals.  The clinician considered the total potential exposure and the synergistic, combined effect of the toxic exposure risk activities.  The clinician stated that medical literature did not demonstrate a causal relationship between the Veteran's toxic exposure risk activities and the development of hypertension.  

After consideration of the record, the Board finds service connection is not warranted for hypertension.  Initially, the Board finds hypertension was not incurred in service.  There is no diagnosis of hypertension or evidence of sustained hypertensive-level blood pressure readings during active service and no probative evidence that hypertension first manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within a year after separation from active service.  Notably, a VA examiner determined it was not incurred in service and there is no medical evidence of competent lay evidence (such as a history of high blood pressure readings) during service to suggest an in-service onset.  

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has asserted that her hypertension began during service.  While she is competent to report objective symptoms, and the Board does not doubt her credibility, for VA purposes a diagnosis of hypertension must be confirmed by blood pressure readings taken two or more times on at least three different days, with hypertension defined as when diastolic blood pressure is predominantly 90mm. or greater, and isolated systolic hypertension means that the systolic blood pressure is predominantly 160mm. or greater with a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90mm.  38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.  Consequently, a diagnosis of hypertension requires specified medical testing, and the Veteran has not been shown to possess the requisite medical training or credentials to competently render a diagnosis or an etiology opinion regarding hypertension.  As such, any lay assertion as to hypertension being either manifest during service (or during the one-year presumptive period) or otherwise etiologically related to service does not constitute competent evidence and lacks probative value.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In summary, the competent evidence of record does not show that hypertension was present in service or within one year thereafter, and the post-service evidence of record otherwise weighs against a finding of a current disability with a nexus to service, including in-service toxic risk activity.  Service connection for hypertension accordingly must be denied. 

Infertility

The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a VA compensation claim.  See Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328, 1332 (1997).  In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) has held that the requirement of a current disability is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or proximate thereto.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013).  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that symptoms causing functional impairment may be considered a disability even in the absence of a diagnosed condition.  Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1367-68 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  However, to establish the presence of a disability, a veteran will need to show that his or her symptoms reach the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity.  Id.

Service connection is not warranted for infertility because the record is absent probative evidence of a current disability.  There is no diagnosis of record.  The treatment records of record reveal no diagnosis, and the Veteran did not report that there are outstanding records revealing such a diagnosis.  

Again, the Veteran lacks the requisite medical training or credentials to provide competent lay evidence as to an infertility diagnosis or a nexus to service.  See Jandreau, supra.  In the absence of any competent evidence supporting her claim, there is no error in the AOJ's not requesting a medical examination or nexus opinion, as there is no reasonable likelihood that such examination would reveal favorable medical findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4).  

Accordingly, the claim for service connection for infertility must be denied. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

The claim for service connection for diabetes is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.  The Board finds a medical opinion was needed to determine whether the diabetes was incurred in service based on the July 1989 finding of trace sugary in urinalysis.  

The claim for service connection for anemia is remanded to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the rating decision on appeal.  The Board finds a medical opinion was needed to determine whether the anemia is secondary to the service-connected breast cancer, status-post mastectomy, based on the June 2003 finding of postoperative anemia after the mastectomy.  

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate VA clinician, based upon a claims file review, as to whether the Veteran's diabetes mellitus was at least as likely as not (at least an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence) incurred in service.  

A detailed rationale must be provided, with consideration of the July 1989, February 1990, and February 1991 urinalysis findings, including the July 1989 finding of trace sugar.  Full consideration of the Veteran's lay contentions must also be provided, and any disagreement with the lay contentions must be explained. 

2. Obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate VA clinician, based upon a claims file review, as to whether the anemia was at least as likely as not (at least an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence) caused or aggravated by the service-connected breast cancer, status-post mastectomy.  

A detailed rationale must be provided, with consideration of the June 2003 diagnosis of mild postoperative anemia and diagnoses of record from August 2015.  Full consideration of the Veteran's lay contentions must also be provided, and any disagreement with the lay contentions must be explained.
