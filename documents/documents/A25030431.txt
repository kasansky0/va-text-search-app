ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an anxiety condition is denied. 

Entitlement to service connection for depression/insomnia is denied. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Without good cause, the Veteran failed to show for his VA examinations scheduled for March 18, 2023, and June 28, 2023.

2. The evidence of record fails to show that the Veteran is diagnosed with anxiety, depression or insomnia.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for an anxiety condition are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.655.

2. The criteria for service connection for depression/insomnia are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.655.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from September 2019 to August 2021. These matters come to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from rating decisions dated April 2023 and August 2023. 

The Veteran filed his original claim for depression/insomnia in January 2023. After service connection was denied in April 2023, he filed a new claim for service connection for an anxiety condition. In August 2023, service connection for this condition was denied; however, service connection for the purpose of establishing eligibility for treatment was granted on the basis that the evidence showed that the Veteran was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with depressed mood during service. 

The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal in August 2023 and requested direct review of all three of these issues by a Veterans Law Judge. 

As a preliminary matter, the Board notes that although the Veteran identified "service connection for the purpose of establishing eligibility for treatment" as an issue for appeal on his VA Form 10182, this matter cannot be appealed as it was already granted in full in the August 2023 rating decision. Accordingly, there is no case or controversy for consideration by the Board with regard to this matter; and it will not be considered in this decision. 

Given the Veteran's docket selection, for each issue properly on appeal, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time that the decision pertaining to that issue was rendered. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted thereafter cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Entitlement to service connection for an anxiety condition and entitlement to service connection for depression/insomnia

Service connection is warranted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease that was incurred or aggravated during active military service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). In general, service connection requires: (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) medical evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004). When a disability is initially diagnosed after separation from service and not within any applicable presumptive period, service connection may be granted if all the evidence establishes that it was incurred in or related to service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

In rendering a decision on appeal, the Board must analyze the credibility and probative value of all medical and lay evidence of record, account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 1154(a); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990). When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Board must resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the veteran. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. 49. To deny a claim on its merits, the evidence must weigh persuasively against the claim. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781-82 (2021).

The Veteran asserts that he suffers from anxiety, depression and insomnia, all of which were caused by or are related to his active-duty service. Unfortunately, the evidence currently of record fails to show that the Veteran has been diagnosed with any of these conditions. 

The Veteran's service treatment records indicate that he sought treatment for a psychiatric condition during service and was given a diagnosis of "adjustment disorder with depressed mood." He endorsed feelings of anxiety, depression and insomnia, but his treatment providers concluded that his disability picture as a whole, to include the presence of anxiety, depression and insomnia, reflected "adjustment disorder."

Prior to the adjudication of the Veteran's claims, VA scheduled the Veteran for two psychiatric VA examinations (first for depression/insomnia and then anxiety), but on both occasions, the Veteran failed to attend. He did not provide an explanation for his failure to show, nor did he attempt to reschedule the examinations.

When a veteran, without good cause, fails to report for an examination scheduled in conjunction with an original compensation claim (such as a claim for entitlement to service connection), the claim must be decided based on the evidence of record. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(b). This means that the claim is decided even though a VA examination has not been completed. Examples of "good cause" for failure to attend an examination include but are not limited to the illness or hospitalization of the veteran, or the death of an immediate family member. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.655(a).

There is no indication that the Veteran did not receive notice of the examination dates. Indeed, the record contains internal memoranda setting out the multiple times that VA contacted the Veteran via phone, text, and mail to notify the Veteran of his examination dates. The address and phone number at which VA attempted to contact the Veteran matches those provided by the Veteran when he filed his claims. Moreover, the Veteran was sent copies of both rating decisions explaining that the Veteran failed to show for his VA examinations. There is no indication that the Veteran made any attempt to reschedule his examinations, nor did he provide any explanation for missing them when he filed his VA Form 10182. 

As the Veteran did not provide good cause for missing his VA examinations, and as the Veteran had two opportunities to attend a psychiatric examination, the Board finds that an additional remand for another opportunity to attend is not warranted. The Board will, therefore, proceed with the adjudication of these claims without the benefit of additional medical evidence provided in a VA examination report. 

As set out above, the only diagnosis reflected in the Veteran's claims file is his in-service diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depressed mood. Anxiety, depression and insomnia are noted only as symptoms of the Veteran's adjustment disorder. Because there is no other evidence suggesting that the Veteran currently suffers from adjustment disorder or from anxiety, depression, or insomnia as conditions in themselves, the Board cannot conclude that the Veteran currently suffers from any of those disabilities.

In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3?Vet. App.?223, 225 (1992); see also Rabideau v. Derwinski, 2?Vet. App.?141, 143-44 (1992); McClain v. Nicholson, 21?Vet. App.?319 (2007) (recognizing that a disability could arise at any time during a claim). Accordingly, service connection cannot be granted for these conditions. It is with regret that the Board must deny these claims on the basis that the evidence does not indicate the Veteran currently suffers from these conditions.

In concluding so, the Board reiterates the fact that, on two occasions, the Veteran failed to show for his VA examinations. These examinations were scheduled in order to aid the Veteran in the development of his claim, to include by determining whether the Veteran currently suffers from anxiety, depression and insomnia, and discussing whether these conditions are related to active-duty service. These VA examinations would have provided medical evidence key to establishing whether the Veteran is entitled to service connection. 

With that said, if the Veteran wishes to continue to pursue service connection for anxiety and or depression/insomnia, he is encouraged to file a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim and include or identify new or relevant evidence to support his claim. Such evidence may include new treatment records showing an anxiety, depression, or insomnia diagnosis, or a letter from a treatment provider discussing the Veteran's current psychiatric conditions and their relationship to the Veteran's service.

If the Veteran files such a claim and is scheduled for a VA examination, the Board reminds the Veteran that VA's duty to assist him in developing his claim is a two-way street, and he must participate to the extent possible. See Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991). The Veteran is encouraged to attend any scheduled VA examinations.
