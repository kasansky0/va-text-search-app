ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for hepatic cirrhosis (claimed as a liver condition), as secondary to hepatitis C is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's hepatic cirrhosis is proximately due to his service-connected hepatitis C.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for hepatic cirrhosis as secondary to service-connected hepatitis C are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served in the Air Force from August 1966 to June 1972.

In the September 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket. A Board hearing was held on December 16, 2024. A copy of the transcript is associated with the Veteran's claims file.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the July 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or a representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a). If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801. 

Due to advanced age, the appeal has been advanced on the docket. See 38 U.S.C. §7107 (a)(2); 38 C.F.R. §20.800 (c).

Service connection for hepatic cirrhosis.

Secondary service connection may be granted for a disability that is proximately due to, or aggravated by, a service-connected disease or injury. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. To prevail on secondary service connection, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) nexus evidence between the two. See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998). 

If the positive and negative evidence is evenly or approximately balanced, the claimant receives the benefit of the doubt. See Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side, or another, is the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine not for application).

Initially, the Board notes that the Veteran is service connected for hepatitis C. See July 2024 Rating Decision - Codesheet. The issue on appeal therefore becomes whether the Veteran has a current liver condition that is proximately due to his service-connected hepatitis C. 

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in July 2024. At the examination, the Veteran reported that he was told that he has cirrhosis. The examiner did not diagnose the Veteran with cirrhosis. The examiner stated that liver imaging and biopsy are ways to diagnose cirrhosis. The examiner then cited to a biopsy that was performed in 2003, which did not confirm cirrhosis. See July 2024 VA Examination. 

At the hearing, the Veteran testified that his primary care doctor advised him that he had cirrhosis. See Hearing Transcript, page 3. The Veteran submitted records from his private doctor, Dr. F.J. The records establish that Dr. F.J. completed imaging in March 2023. Based on the imaging, Dr. F.J. diagnosed the Veteran with hepatic cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C infection. Additionally, included in the records were the results of a September 2021 procedure that indicated cirrhosis. See February 2025 Medical Treatment Record - Non-Government Facility. 

The Board finds the July 2024 examiner's conclusion that the Veteran does not have cirrhosis is based on a biopsy that was taken 21 years prior to the examination. The examiner did not request another biopsy or imaging be completed nor did the examiner inquire if the Veteran has had more recent tests, despite the Veteran stating he has been diagnosed with cirrhosis. Consequently, the Board assigned more probative weight to the private examiner's opinion, which is based on recent test results. Dr. F.J. concluded that the Veteran has hepatic cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C infection.  

Accordingly, resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the Veteran's hepatic cirrhosis is secondary to his service-connected hepatitis C. The claim for service connection is granted.
