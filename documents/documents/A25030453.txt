REMANDED

Entitlement to basic eligibility to education assistance benefits under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. Chapter 33 Post-9/11 GI Bill (known as the Post-9/11 GI Bill or Chapter 33) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Claimant served in the Illinois Army National Guard from December 2016 to December 2022.  She appeals a March 2023 decision letter by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) denying basic eligibility to Chapter 33 education benefits, and requested the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) conduct a direct review of the evidence considered by the RO.  See April 2023 VA Form 10182.

Under the direct docket, the Board will consider the same record as that before the RO at the time of the March 2023 decision letter.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  The Board cannot consider evidence submitted after the March 2023 decision letter.  Id.  If evidence was associated with the claims file during a period of time when additional evidence was not allowed, the Board has not considered it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.300.  However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the RO in the adjudication of the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Remand is permitted only to correct a pre-decisional error or for any other error the correction of which raises a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802.  Based on the discussion below, the Board finds remand is warranted to correct pre-decisional duty to assist errors.

At the outset, the Board notes the Claimant appeals a March 2023 RO decision letter that is not currently uploaded to her electronic record; however, the Board has found a pre-decisional duty to assist error was made by the RO and remand is warranted regardless of the content of the March 2023 decision letter itself.

In March 2023, the Claimant applied for Chapter 33 education benefits for a registered nurse program at Shawnee Community College beginning in August 2023.  See March 2023 VA Form 22-1990.  Later that month, the RO denied entitlement to Chapter 33 benefits as the Claimant lacked the requisite length of active duty service required to be eligible to receive benefits.

Eligibility for education benefits under Chapter 33 is based on certain qualifying periods and types of active duty for individuals who served on active duty after September 10, 2001.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 3301-3324; see also 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520.

An individual must have served a minimum of 90 aggregate days of active duty excluding active duty for entry level and skill training and, after completion of such service, (1) continued on active duty; (2) was discharged from service with an honorable discharge; (3) was released from service characterized as honorable and placed on the retired list, temporary disability retired list, or transferred to the Fleet Reserve or the Fleet Marine Corps Reserve; (4) was released from service characterized as honorable for further service in a reserve component; or (5) was discharged or released from service for a medical condition that preexisted such service and is not determined to be service connected; hardship, as determined by the Secretary of the military department concerned; or a physical or mental condition that interfered with the individual's performance of duty but was not characterized as a disability and did not result from the individual's own misconduct.  38 U.S.C. § 3311; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520(a).

Alternatively, an individual is eligible for Chapter 33 benefits if they served a minimum of 30 continuous days on active duty and, after completion of such service, were discharged or released from active duty under other than dishonorable conditions due to a service-connected disability.  38 U.S.C. § 3311; 38 C.F.R. § 21.9520(b).  The Claimant does not contend that she was discharged due to a service-connected disability and the record does not reflect otherwise; thus, this exception does not apply.  Thus, the evidence must first show that the Claimant served a minimum of 90 aggregate days of active duty, excluding active duty for entry level and skill training.

As noted above, the Claimant served in the National Guard from December 2016 to December 2022.  Her initial period of active duty for training, from May 2017 to September 2017, is not considered qualifying active duty for Chapter 33 as it is active duty for entry level and skill training until she completes 24 months of qualifying active duty service.  Thus, her service from May 30, 2017 to September 28, 2017 cannot be considered qualifying active duty for Chapter 33 until she completes 24 months of other qualifying active duty service.

The record reflects the Claimant also served from July 11, 2018 to March 31, 2019 and from April 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020.  See March 2023 VADIR Information Report.

Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 3301(1)(A), qualifying active duty service for members of the regular components of the Armed Forces is full time duty other than active duty for training (ACDUTRA).  For members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces, qualifying active duty includes service on active duty under a call or order to active duty under section 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, or 12304 of title 10 or section 712 of title 14.  See 38 U.S.C. § 3301(1)(B).  For members of the National Guard of the United States, in addition to service described above for members of the regular and reserve components of the Armed Forces, qualifying active duty includes full-time service (i) in the National Guard of a State for the purpose of organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the National Guard; or (ii) in the National Guard under section 502(f) of title 32 when authorized by the President or the Secretary of Defense for the purpose of responding to a national emergency declared by the President and supported by Federal funds.  38 U.S.C. § 3301(1)(C).

The nature of the Claimant's service from July 11, 2018 to March 31, 2019 and from April 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020 is unclear.  The March 2023 VADIR Information Report states these two periods of service were not qualifying service under section 502(f) of title 32, but do not address whether the service qualified under any of the sections noted above under Title 10 or section 712 of Title 14, or address if the service was for the purpose of organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training the National Guard.  There are no military personnel records, to include Orders for the aforementioned periods of service.  The RO did not contact the Department of Defense (DoD) or Illinois Army National Guard to adequately assess the nature of the Claimant's periods of service.  This constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  Therefore, as the Board is unable to determine whether the Claimant's period of service may be considered qualifying active duty service for purposes of entitlement to the Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, a remand is necessary to obtain clarification from DoD and/or the appropriate National Guard as to whether the Claimant had qualifying service.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Upload the March 2023 decision letter denying entitlement to basic eligibility to Chapter 33 education assistance benefits to the Claimant's electronic file.

2. Submit a request to DoD and/or the Illinois Army National Guard to determine the nature of Claimant's periods of service, including but not limited to the periods from July 11, 2018 to March 31, 2019 and April 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020.  The record reflects the Claimant served in the National Guard from December 28, 2016 to December 27, 2022.

Request the appropriate authority submit copies of the Claimant's Orders for her National Guard Service.

All requests and responses should be documented and uploaded to the record.

3. Thereafter, determine the Claimant's entitlement to basic eligibility for Chapter 33 educational assistance benefits, provide a copy to the Claimant and upload a copy of the determination to the electronic file.
