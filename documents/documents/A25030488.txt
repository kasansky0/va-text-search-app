REMANDED

An initial evaluation in excess of 10 percent for an ischiorectal and transanal abscess prior to June 26, 2024, and in excess of 30 percent thereafter is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran had active service from October 1951 to April 1955, February 1957 to August 1960, and October 1961 to October 1974.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2024 rating decision.

The Veteran timely appealed this decision to the Board in a September 2024 Notice of Disagreement (VA Form 10182) and requested a direct review by a Veterans Law Judge.  Since the Veteran chose direct review, the Board, in adjudicating this matter, may consider evidence associated with the record through the September 2024 rating decision on appeal.

An initial evaluation in excess of 10 percent for an ischiorectal and transanal abscess prior to June 26, 2024, and in excess of 30 percent thereafter is remanded.

The Veteran's initial service connection claim was received by the RO on May 12, 2005.  The Board observes a March 2006 Rating Decision indicates entitlement to compensation for an ischiorectal and transanal abscess was deferred.  A May 2023 rating decision granted service connection for an ischiorectal and transanal abscess with an evaluation of 10 percent effective April 9, 2021.  Subsequently, a June 2023 rating decision granted an earlier effective date for service connection for an ischiorectal and transanal abscess because the AOJ found the Veteran has continuously pursued his claim since the date of the receipt of his initial claim.  Subsequently, a September 2024 rating decision increased the Veteran's service-connected ischiorectal and transanal abscess to 30 percent effective June 26, 2024.  The Veteran appealed the September 2024 rating decision and contends a 30-percent evaluation is warranted from May 12, 2005, forward.  See September 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's assertion that the July 2024 VA examination failed to consider the evidence of record.  See August 2024 VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review.  The Board observes the Veteran explicitly mentioned to the VA examiner his regular and continuing use of his adult undergarments as a result of his service-connected abscess.  Id.  The Board observes the July 2024 VA examination does not address the severity of the Veteran's service-connected condition throughout the appeal period.

VA's duty to assist may include development of evidence through a retrospective medical opinion to determine the earliest date that a condition manifested.  Chotta v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 80 (2008); Vigil v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 63 (2008) (holding that the duty to assist may include development of medical evidence through a retrospective medical evaluation where there is a lack of medical evidence for the relevant time period).  Thus, given the available evidence at the time of the September 2024 rating decision reflects a pre-decisional duty to assist error, the Board finds a remand is required to obtain a retrospective medical opinion to determine whether an earlier effective date is warranted.

The matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination to determine the severity of his service-connected ischiorectal and transanal abscess.

The Veteran's claims file, including a copy of this REMAND, must be made available to and reviewed by the examiner in conjunction with the examination.  The examiner must note in the examination report the evidence in the claims file has been reviewed.

The appropriate Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) should be filled out.

The examiner should describe the severity, frequency, and duration of all symptoms associated with the Veteran's service-connected ischiorectal and transanal abscess on appeal to include according to diagnostic codes 7335-7332 and the appropriate DBQ.

Specifically, the examiner should request from the Veteran as to how long he has been using his adult undergarments due to his service-connected ischiorectal and transanal abscess.

Further, considering the lay evidence and medical evidence of record, the examiner should provide a retrospective medical opinion as to the severity of the Veteran's service-connected ischiorectal and transanal abscess for the period from May 2005 to the present according to diagnostic codes 7335-7332 and the appropriate DBQ.

The examiner must provide a comprehensive report that includes a complete rationale for all opinions and conclusions reached.  If the examiner cannot provide the requested opinion without resorting to speculation, they should expressly indicate this and provide a supporting rationale as to why an opinion cannot be made without resorting to speculation.
