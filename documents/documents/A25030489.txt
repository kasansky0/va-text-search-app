REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for hypertension, claimed as high blood pressure, is remanded.

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 2000 to October 2004. 

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 and March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the Veteran's claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Missing Record

The Board finds this matter must be remanded to cure a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

In April 2018, the AOJ requested the Veteran's STRs.  The Board notes that the AOJ received a response to this request and the records were uploaded into the Veteran's claims file in May 2018.   In reviewing the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) uploaded to the Veteran's clams file in May 2018, the Board notes that the Veteran's the separation examination from active duty is not part of the uploaded records.  Additionally, it does not appear that the AOJ made further attempts to request the Veteran's separation examination.  

When obtaining records from a Federal department or agency, the VA must make as many requests as are necessary to obtain the relevant records and will end its search only after it concludes that these records either do not exist, or that further efforts to obtain these records would be futile.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(2).  Additionally, a formal finding of unavailability should be issued if the records cannot be located.  To date, there has been no formal finding of unavailability.  This constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error.

Thus, upon remand, the AOJ should attempt to locate the Veteran's separation examination.  If this record cannot be located, the AOJ should make a formal finding of the unavailability of records and inform the Veteran of possible alternative evidence that can be submitted.

Accordingly, this matter is REMANDED for the following action:

Undertake the appropriate development to obtain the Veteran's complete service treatment records for his period of active service from October 2000 to October 2004, to specifically include his separation examination.  If any requested records are deemed unavailable, the record should be annotated to reflect such, and the Veteran notified.  If unavailable, a formal finding should be prepared, outlining all efforts made to obtain these records.
