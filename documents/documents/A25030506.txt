ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is denied. 

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea did not have its onset in service and is not etiologically related to service. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for obstructive sleep apnea are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from March 1994 to March 1996. 

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a March 2024 rating decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). This March 2024 rating decision constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the August 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board is cognizant of the recent decision issued by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in the case of Williams v. McDonough, 37 Vet. App. 305 (2024). There, the Court held, in essence, that the Board must refrain from deciding a case until the case proceeds to the point where a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2). In this case, a docket switch is no longer permitted under the terms of 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(c)(2) as it is more than one year from the date that the AOJ mailed notice of the decision on appeal, and it is more than 60 days of the date that the Board received the August 2024 VA Form 10182. Therefore, the Board shall proceed with adjudication.

Service Connection Criteria

Generally, service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value. 38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999). When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence as to any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA will resolve reasonable doubt in favor of the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is denied. 

The Veteran contends that his obstructive sleep apnea is related to his service. See June 2023 Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits (VA Form 21-526EZ). Specifically, the Veteran asserts that due to him wearing firefighting equipment, he began to have trouble breathing which caused his sleep apnea years later. The March 2024 rating decision made a favorable finding that the Veteran's military occupational specialty was a fire fighter and that his participation in a toxic exposure risk activity is conceded and that he was currently diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea; the Board is bound by these favorable findings.  

The Veteran's service treatment records are negative for complaints, treatments or diagnoses related to obstructive sleep apnea. A November 1995 service discharge examination found the Veteran's lungs to be normal. In a March 1996 service discharge Report of Medical History, the Veteran denied that he had or ever had shortness of breath and frequent trouble sleeping. He also denied that he ever had any illness or injury other than those already noted.

Turning to the question of whether there is an etiological relationship between the Veteran's service and his diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea, the Board notes that the record contains two etiology opinions which must be considered and weighed. See Hayes v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 60, 69-70 (1993). When faced with conflicting medical opinions, the Board may favor one medical opinion over the other. See Evans v. West, 12 Vet. App. 22, 30 (1998). The Board will consider each of these opinions below.

A February 2024 VA examiner opined that the claimed obstructive sleep apnea was less likely than not (likelihood is less than approximately balanced or nearly equal) caused by the indicated toxic exposure risk activity(ies), after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic, combined effect of all toxic exposure risk activities of the Veteran. The examiner stated that the Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record report reveals the Veteran was exposed to non-deployment related exposure due to his military occupational specialty as a firefighter. The examiner stated that, according to the medical literature, the Veteran's obstructive sleep apnea is more likely caused by his overweight as his body mass index was 29.5 and that obstructive sleep apnea is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder. The examiner noted that obstructive sleep apnea caused the Veteran to repeatedly stop and start breathing while he sleeps and that obstructive sleep apnea occurs when his throat muscles intermittently relax and block his airway during sleep. 

The February 2024 VA examiner explained that obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by episodes of a complete (apnea) or partial collapse (hypopnea) of the upper airway with an associated decrease in oxygen saturation or arousal from sleep and that this disturbance results in fragmented, nonrestorative sleep. The examiner noted that other symptoms include loud, disruptive snoring, witnessed apneas during sleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness. The examiner emphasized that the most common causes of obstructive sleep apnea in adults is obesity, the male sex, and advancing age. The examiner concluded that a thorough review of medical literature failed to demonstrate a causal relationship because the Veteran's toxic exposure risk activities and sleep apnea and thus, a nexus has not been established.  The Board finds that the provider considered all evidence of record after thorough review of the claims file, including statements properly weighed. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2009); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007) ("[A] medical opinion...must support its conclusion with an analysis the Board can consider and weight against contrary opinion"). Furthermore, the medical examination report contained clear conclusions with supporting data and a thorough rationale. See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 301. Therefore, the opinion is afforded probative weight. Significantly, there is no probative etiology opinion to the contrary.

The Board acknowledges the statements of the Veteran as to the existence and etiology of his claimed obstructive sleep apnea and acknowledges that the Veteran is competent to give evidence about what he experienced. For example, he is competent to discuss the fact that he experiences symptoms of pain. See, e.g., Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994). However, while the Veteran is competent to report his current symptoms, as a lay person he does not have the education, training, or experience to diagnose or opine as to the etiology of the condition. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377-78 (Fed. Cir. 2007); Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011). Therefore, the Veteran's statements are of low probative value.

Therefore, the Board finds that service connection for obstructive sleep apnea is not warranted. The appeal is denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, supra.
