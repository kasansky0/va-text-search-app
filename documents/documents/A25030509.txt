REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from March 1989 to February 1993, from February 1995 to August 1995, and from November 1995 to January 1996, including service in Southwest Asia. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  In March 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of February 26, 2024 - the date of the rating decision on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. §?20.301.  If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after February 26, 2024, the Board did not consider it.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.  See 38?C.F.R. §?3.2501.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 1131; 38?C.F.R. §?3.303.  Establishing service connection generally requires evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the current disability and the claimed in-service disease or injury.  Shedden v. Principi,?381 F.3d 1163?(Fed. Cir. 2004).

Certain chronic diseases, including hypertension and other organic diseases of the nervous system, will be presumed related to service, absent an intercurrent cause, if shown as chronic in service; or, if manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service; or, if noted in service (or within an applicable presumptive period) with continuity of symptomatology since service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.  Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

1. Entitlement to service connection for PFB is granted. 

The Veteran reported having bumps after shaving at the December 2023 VA examination and stated that he currently used creams to prevent breakouts.  While the VA examiner found no objective evidence of PFB on physical examination at that time, the examiner also stated that the Veteran had a "current diagnosis of chin bumps" in an accompanying medical opinion.  Moreover, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has recognized that some conditions, by their inherent nature, wax and wane and accordingly are sometimes active and other times not.  See Ardison v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 405, 408 (1994).

PFB is defined as "a condition resembling folliculitis, involving the bearded region...  The primary lesion is a pinhead-sized pustule, pierced by a hair; if neglected this may lead to impetiginization and crust formation and may become chronic.  Popularly known as razor bumps."  DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY 1565 (31st ed. 2007).

The Veteran is competent to report the current presence of PFB and the Board has no reason to doubt his credibility in doing so.  Additionally, an August 1989 service treatment record (STR) shows that the Veteran complained of shaving bumps and was prescribed hydrocortisone cream for mild PFB.  Accordingly, the first and second elements of service connection are met.

Regarding the final element, the Veteran is competent to establish a nexus between his current PFB and the PFB he experienced in service, and his assertion of an in-service onset and diagnosis of PFB is credible and supported by the evidence of record.  In this regard, the Board finds that the unfavorable December 2023 VA opinion is based on an inaccurate factual premise (did not concede in-service PFB), and therefore is of no probative value.  Thus, as all the elements for service connection are met, the benefit sought on appeal is granted.

Service connection for asthma, ED, hemorrhoids, hives, hypertension, an esophageal disorder, a prostate disorder, a TMJ disorder, a bilateral foot disability, a bilateral ankle disability, a bilateral knee disability, a bilateral hip/thigh disability, and a groin disability is not warranted because the competent and credible evidence reflects that the Veteran has not been diagnosed with such a condition at any point just prior to or during the appeal period.  In this regard, the December 2023 VA examiner, who specifically considered the Veteran's reported history, determined that the Veteran did not have a current diagnosis of hemorrhoids, an esophageal disorder (including gastroesophageal reflux disease and hiatal hernia), a bilateral ankle disability, or a bilateral knee disability based on an interview and examination of the Veteran and review of the claims file.  Notably, the Veteran denied having hemorrhoids since he once had an episode in 1992.  Although the Veteran's current symptom of acid reflux was noted, the examiner explained that reflux became a disease when it caused frequent or severe symptoms or injury and found no objective evidence to support a diagnosis of GERD.  Moreover, the examiner concluded the Veteran's GERD was not consistent with an undiagnosed illness or medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness, as there was no evidence of any persistent or recurrent symptoms of reflux and reflux was the only identified symptom.  38 C.F.R. § 3.317.

Furthermore, the evidence does not indicate that the Veteran has pain in his prostate, TMJ, feet, ankles, knees, hips/thighs, or groin that reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity to constitute a disability for VA purposes.  Additionally, the Veteran has never endorsed pain in his prostate, TMJ, feet, or hips/thighs at any point during the review period.  As such, no associated functional impairment has been demonstrated and a current disability cannot be conceded.  Saunders?v. Wilkie,?886 F.3d 1356?(Fed. Cir. 2018). 

While the Veteran is competent to report symptoms he observes, he is not competent to diagnose asthma, ED, hemorrhoids, hives, hypertension, an esophageal disorder, a prostate disorder, a TMJ disorder, a bilateral foot disability, a bilateral ankle disability, a bilateral knee disability, a bilateral hip/thigh disability, or a groin disability, as this is a complex medical question that is beyond the ken of a layperson.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Moreover, absent any competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability within the relevant evidentiary period that may be associated with active-duty service or a service-connected disability, the duty to obtain a VA examination or medical opinion with regard to asthma, ED, hives, hypertension, a prostate disorder, a TMJ disorder, bilateral foot, bilateral hip/thigh, and groin disabilities is not triggered.  See 38?C.F.R. §?3.159(c)(4); see also McLendon v. Nicholson, 20?Vet. App.?79, 84?(2006).

Thus, the competent evidence of record is against the Veteran's claims of entitlement to service connection for asthma, ED, hemorrhoids, hives, hypertension, an esophageal disorder, a prostate disorder, a TMJ disorder, a bilateral foot disability, a bilateral ankle disability, a bilateral knee disability, a bilateral hip/thigh disability, and a groin disability based on a lack of a current disability, and hence, the first element of service connection is not met, and the claims fail on this basis alone.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3?Vet. App.?223, 225 (1992) (in the absence of proof of present disability there can be no successful claim).  Accordingly, since the competing evidence is not in approximate balance, or nearly equal, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is inapplicable, and the claims must be denied.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021); 38?C.F.R. § 3.102. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

15. Entitlement to service connection for diabetes is remanded. 

The December 2023 VA examiner determined that the Veteran had prediabetes and did not meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes (e.g., A1C of 6.5 percent or greater on 2 or more occasions), and noted his most recent A1C result was 6.5 percent in August 2023.  However, the August 2023 A1C is not of record and an April 2023 VA treatment record shows the Veteran had a A1C of 6.5 percent in March 2023.  It is thus not clear whether the examiner considered the Veteran's March 2023 A1C or erroneously dated the A1C on the examination report.  This constitutes a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring clarification on remand.

16. Entitlement to service connection for a urinary disorder is remanded.

The December 2023 nexus opinion addressing the etiology of the Veteran's urinary disorder is inadequate. In this regard, the examiner did not provide rationale for her negative TERA opinion and did not opine as to whether the Veteran's condition was otherwise directly related to service, to include urinary symptoms therein.  The failure to obtain an adequate opinion is a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring an addendum opinion on remand.

17. Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is remanded. 

Remand is necessary to correct a pre-decisional duty to assist error.  In this regard, the November 2023 VA examiner indicated that a diagnosis of hearing loss could not be made, because reliable audiological results were unable to be obtained, and stated she was unable to determine the etiology without resorting to mere speculation.  Notably, the Veteran was experiencing a migraine on the day of examination and testing was discontinued. Therefore, the November 2023 examination is inadequate, and a new VA examination is warranted on remand. 

18. Entitlement to service connection for a back disability is remanded.

19. Entitlement to service connection for a TBI is remanded. 

20. Entitlement to service connection for a neurological disorder is remanded. 

The Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination for his back disability, TBI, and neurological disorder, and the duty to obtain one is triggered based on the pre-decisional evidence of record, given the Veteran's current diagnoses, his STRs, and in-service toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20?Vet. App.?79 (2006).  This is a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring a remand.

21. Entitlement to service connection for a left shoulder disability is remanded. 

22. Entitlement to service connection for a neck disability is remanded.

23. Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is remanded.  

As the record indicates that the Veteran's neck and left shoulder disabilities may be secondary to his Bell's palsy (see August 2023 VA treatment record) and given the November 2023 VA examiner's opinion relating the Veteran's tinnitus to Bell's palsy, action on these inextricably intertwined claims is deferred pending the above development and must be remanded as well.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Schedule the Veteran for a VA examination determine the nature and etiology of his hearing loss, back, TBI, and neurological conditions, as well as an addendum opinion addressing the etiology of his diabetes and urinary disorder from an examiner other than the December 2023 examiner.  The entire claims file should be made available to the examiner.  All indicated tests should be conducted and all findings reported in detail.  After a review of the claims file, the examiner is asked to address the following:

(a)	Clarify whether the Veteran has had a diagnosis of diabetes at any point since April 2023, even if currently resolved.  If such a diagnosis is not warranted, please reconcile this finding with the April 2023 VA treatment record (noting A1C of 6.5 in March 2023) and the December 2023 VA examination report (noting A1C of 6.5 in August 2023). 

(b)	Is it at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability) that the Veteran's urinary disorder had its onset in or is otherwise related to service, to include as a result of the documented January 1996 report of increased urgency urinating and his participation in a TERA during service in Southwest Asia?

In addressing this question, the examiner must consider (i) the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments; and (ii) the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs of the Veteran.

(c)	Assess whether the Veteran has hearing loss pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.385.  If hearing loss is shown in either ear, is it at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability) that such disability had its onset in or is otherwise related to service? 

In addressing this question, please consider any hearing threshold shifts during service (see February1989, March 1989, and February 1993 audiograms) - please note that a definition for a "significant threshold shift" must be provided if relying on the same in denying a nexus - and the possibility of delayed onset hearing loss.

(d)	Is it at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability) that any currently diagnosed back disability had its onset in or is otherwise related to service, to include as a result of the documented May 1990 report of back pain therein?

(e)	Is it at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability) that a TBI had its onset in or is otherwise related to service, to include as a result of the documented June 1991 report of being in a fistfight and the December 1992 facial laceration from a fall therein? 

(f)	Is it at least as likely as not (approximately 50 percent probability) that any currently diagnosed neurological disorder, including Bell's palsy, had its onset in or is otherwise related to service, to include as a result of the Veteran's participation in a TERA during service in Southwest Asia? 

In addressing this question, the examiner must consider (i) the total potential exposure through all applicable deployments; and (ii) the synergistic, combined effect of all TERAs of the Veteran.

A complete rationale should be provided for all opinions, citing to specific evidence of record and medical principles, as necessary.  If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).

If the inability to provide an opinion without resorting to speculation is due to a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), the AOJ should develop the claim to the extent it is necessary to cure any such deficiency.  If the inability to provide an opinion is due to the examiner's lack of requisite knowledge or training, then the AOJ should obtain an opinion from a medical professional with the knowledge and training needed to render such an opinion.
