ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for tinnitus is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Tinnitus has been shown to have originated in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for tinnitus are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from August 1980 to July 1990.

In August 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction denied service connection for tinnitus.  In August 2024, the Veteran submitted a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, VA Form 10182, and elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the Agency of Original Jurisdiction decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

Service connection for Tinnitus.

The Veteran asserts that service connection for tinnitus is warranted as the claimed disability was due to her in service noise exposure.

Service connection may be established for recurrent disability arising from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service.  38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Service treatment records do not refer to tinnitus or ringing of the ears.  The personnel records convey that the Veteran served in the Navy and her military occupational specialty was a Yeoman.  

In a June 2022 written statement, the Veteran conveyed that she was exposed to gunfire related noise during active service.  

The report of a July 2022 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) audiology examination states that the Veteran complained of tinnitus.  She reported experiencing the onset of recurrent tinnitus "shortly after service."  The Veteran was diagnosed with tinnitus.  

A March 2023 evaluation from C. M. Bucci, PA-C, states that the Veteran's records had been reviewed.  She was diagnosed with tinnitus.  Mr. Bucci concluded that "the Veteran's bilateral tinnitus is at least as likely as not (50% probability) due to and/or related to military acoustic trauma during active-duty military service."  The physician assistant that the Veteran's noise exposure was sustained during her general military trainings.  In support of his conclusion, he noted that medical journal articles conveyed that tinnitus occurred "due to cochlear deterioration and damage as a result of acoustic trauma."  

The record is in at least equipoise as to whether the diagnosed tinnitus originated during active service.  The Veteran has been diagnosed with tinnitus by VA and private examiners.  Mr. Bucci concluded that the diagnosed tinnitus was related to the Veteran's in service hazardous noise exposure sustained during her general military training.  Upon resolution of all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board concludes that service connection for tinnitus is warranted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
