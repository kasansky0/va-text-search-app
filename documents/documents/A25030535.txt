ORDER

Prior to March 16, 2023, entitlement to an initial rating in excess of 30 percent, for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied. 

From March 16, 2023, entitlement to an initial rating of 70 percent, but no higher, for PTSD is granted. 

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. Prior to March 16, 2023, the Veteran's PTSD symptoms most closely approximate occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks but have not manifested in occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.

2. Beginning March 16, 2023, the Veteran's PTSD symptoms most closely approximate occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas but have not manifested in total occupational and social impairment.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. Prior to March 16, 2023, the criteria for entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 30 percent, for PTSD, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411.

2. From March 16, 2023, the criteria for entitlement to a disability rating of 70 percent, but no higher, for PTSD, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 7104; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code (DC) 9411.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1979 to April 1988.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2023 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In March 2024, the Veteran filed a notice of disagreement and selected the Direct Review docket. See March 2024 VA Form 10182. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by application of the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; see generally 38 C.F.R. Part 4. When a question arises as to which of two ratings applies under a particular diagnostic code, the higher rating is assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher rating. Otherwise, the lower rating applies. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. 

The veteran's entire history is to be considered when making disability determinations. 38 C.F.R. § 4.1; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991). Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, it is the current level of disability that is of primary concern. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1995). When the factual findings show distinct time periods during which the veteran exhibited symptoms of disability and such symptoms warrant different disability ratings, staged ratings may also be assigned. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505, 509-10 (2007).

Evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses, known as pyramiding, is generally to be avoided. 38 C.F.R. § 4.14. The critical element in permitting the assignment of several ratings under various diagnostic codes is that none of the symptomatology for any one of the conditions is duplicative or overlapping with the symptomatology of the other condition. Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259, 261-62 (1994).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. When all the evidence is assembled, VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in approximate balance, with the Veteran prevailing in either event, or whether the evidence is persuasively against the claim, in which case the claim is denied. Id.

Entitlement to an increased rating for PTSD. 

The Veteran contends his service-connected PTSD is more disabling than the 30 percent and 70 percent ratings currently in effect. See March 2024 VA Form 10182. The Veteran asserts an increased rating is warranted due to severe symptoms including daily feelings of sadness, sleep disturbances, anxiety, impulsive talking, difficulties with interpersonal relationships, and isolation. See April 2023 VA Examination. 

In this instance, the Veteran is in receipt of a 30 percent evaluation for PTSD from February 3, 2017, to April 4, 2023, and a 70 percent evaluation from April 5, 2023, to the present, under DC 9411, which applies the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders to psychiatric disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130. 

Under the applicable criteria, a 30 percent disability rating is warranted where there is occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks (although generally functioning satisfactorily, with routine behavior, self-care, and conversation normal), due to such symptoms as: depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks (weekly or less often), chronic sleep impairment, mild memory loss (such as forgetting names, directions, recent events). 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411.

A 50 percent rating is warranted where there is occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to symptoms such as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short and long-term memory (e.g., retention of only highly learned material, forgetting to complete tasks); impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; or difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships. Id. 

A 70 percent rating is warranted where there is occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking or mood, due to such symptoms as: suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; speech intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411.

A 100 percent rating is warranted where there is total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations, grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. Id.

The use of the term "such as" in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 demonstrates that the symptoms after that phrase are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list, but rather are to serve as examples of the type and degree of symptoms, or their effects, that would justify a particular rating. See Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436, 442 (2002); see also Sellers v. Principi, 372 F.3d 1318, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2004). It is not required to find the presence of all, most, or even some, of the enumerated symptoms recited for a particular rating. Id. The use of the phrase "such symptoms as," followed by a list of examples, provides guidance as to the severity of symptoms contemplated for each rating, in addition to permitting consideration of other symptoms, particular to each veteran and disorder, and the effect of those symptoms on the claimant's occupational and social situation. Id. 

"A veteran may only qualify for a given disability rating under § 4.130 by demonstrating the particular symptoms associated with that percentage, or others of similar severity, frequency, and duration." Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 117 (Fed. Cir. 2013). The determination of an appropriate disability evaluation pursuant to § 4.130 requires a holistic analysis, which assesses the severity, frequency, and duration of the veteran's mental disorder, quantifies the level of occupational and social impairment, and assigns an evaluation that most nearly approximates that level of occupational and social impairment. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10, 22 (2017).

As the Veteran is seeking an increased rating for PTSD based on the disability evaluation assigned in the rating decision granting service connection, the relevant review period on appeal begins February 3, 2017, the date of service connection. 

The Board notes it has reviewed all the evidence in the record relevant to the period on review. This includes the November 2017 statement of the Veteran's daughter, February 2018 VA examination, November 2022 VA examination, March 2023 private psychological evaluation, April 2023 VA examination, and VAMC records from February 2017 to November 2022. 

Although the Board has an obligation to provide adequate reasons and bases supporting its decision, there is no requirement that the Board discuss every piece of evidence in the record. 

Hence, the Board will summarize the relevant evidence, as deemed appropriate, and the Board's analysis will focus on what the evidence shows, or fails to show, as to the claim.  See Gonzalez v. West, 218 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2000). 

The Board finds the record supports an increased rating to 70 percent as of March 16, 2023, as the relevant evidence of record demonstrates the Veteran's PTSD most closely approximates the rating criteria for the higher disability evaluation under DC 9411 as of that date. 

With consideration of the record as a whole, the Board finds that prior to March 16, 2023, the Veteran's PTSD was manifested by symptoms associated with a 30 percent rating, including depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, difficulty with concentration, and chronic sleep impairment, and symptoms associated with a 50 percent rating, to include disturbances of motivation and mood and difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting. 

Prior to March 16, 2023, the Board finds that the impairment caused by the Veteran's PTSD symptoms most closely approximates the level associated with a 30 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. The Veteran experienced occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks but was generally functioning satisfactorily. He demonstrated routine behavior, appropriate and pleasant engagement and conversation with mental health providers, close family relationships, and sufficient self-care and grooming. See February 2017 to November 2022 VAMC Mental Status Exams. 

As it relates to occupational impairment, the Veteran has not worked the majority of the rating period on appeal, as he was no longer employed as of October 13, 2017. See February 2018 VA Examination. However, the Veteran primarily attributes his inability to work due to chronic pain and mobility issues associated with his back and knee disabilities. The Veteran indicated he fell out of a truck during a shift in October 2017, and further injured his knee resulting in the decision to stop working. See November 2017 VAMC Records. 

While the Veteran indicated he has had difficulties with a business partner, these issues were attributed to his partner's decision to make unauthorized charges on a company credit card and not as the result of the Veteran's PTSD or associated symptoms. Id. Although the Veteran has credibly reported he has difficulty, at times, getting out of bed due to low motivation and fatigue, neither the February 2018 VA examination nor November 2022 VA examination reflect that the Veteran reported any reduction in his activities of daily living due to his mental health condition. 

With regard to social impairment, the Veteran has reported he finds it difficult to socialize with other people and feels disconnected, choosing to stay in his room most of the time. See January 2018 Statement; see also November 2022 VA Examination. The Veteran's daughter has also observed him become depressed and stop attending social gatherings. See November 2017 Statement. However, the Veteran has close family ties with his mother, daughter, brother (with whom he lives), and several grandchildren. The Veteran attends church with his mother on a regular basis and believes this is helpful in keeping him on track. See July 2018 VAMC Records. 

In addition, the Veteran's mental health providers have consistently identified his family relationships, social supports, attendance at church, and positive therapeutic relationships as protective factors for his mental health. See November 2019 VAMC Records; see also February 2020 VAMC Records. 

While the Veteran did experience symptoms contemplated by a 50 percent rating prior to March 16, 2023, the evidence overall does not demonstrate the level of impairment associated with a higher rating before this date. As such, the Veteran's disability picture is most consistent with a 30 percent evaluation prior to March 16, 2023. 

The Veteran then underwent a private psychological evaluation on March 16, 2023. See March 2023 Psychological Evaluation. The evaluation was conducted by Dr. J.R. following a video teleconference with the Veteran. Dr. J.R. found that the Veteran's psychological symptoms presented a moderately negative effect on his ability to perform full-time independent work in a competitive setting. "[The Veteran] suffers from occupational and social impairment, with difficulties that affect him in such areas as work, family relations, judgment, thinking, and mood." Dr. J.R. further opined that his function has, and will continue to be, impaired for an indefinite period by depression with anxiety and interpersonal irritability. 

The Board notes these findings are consistent with the April 2023 VA examination, which showed a worsening of the Veteran's PTSD symptoms and supported the 70 percent evaluation assigned by the AOJ. The examiner found the Veteran's PTSD resulted in occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking and/or mood. The Veteran experienced depressed mood, anxiety, suspiciousness, panic attacks that occur weekly or less often, chronic sleep impairment, flattened affect, disturbances of motivation and mood, difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships, difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances, including work or a work like setting, and an inability to establish and maintain effective relationships. 

Accordingly, as of March 16, 2023, the record reflects a worsening of the Veteran's PTSD, such that his symptoms most closely approximate occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas. 

Turning to a 100 percent evaluation, the Board finds that a total rating for the Veteran's PTSD is not warranted at any point during the appeal period on review. Of particular note, the rating criteria associated with a 100 percent evaluation are severe, as represented by symptoms such as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, DC 9411.

Here, such severe impairment is not shown. The medical and lay evidence of record do not reflect any of the symptoms included in the individual rating criteria for a 100 percent rating. Moreover, the evidence also does not contain any further symptoms of similar severity, frequency, or duration. Vazquez-Claudio, supra. 

Specifically, the record does not contain indications the Veteran experiences gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations, grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name. 

While the Veteran reported during the November 2022 VA examination that he experiences flashbacks to the motor vehicle accident during service, there is no indication they are caused by delusions or hallucinations or result in disorientation to time or place. As such, the Veteran's PTSD has not manifested in total occupational and social impairment to date.

Accordingly, the Board finds that the probative evidence of record persuasively supports a disability rating of 30 percent prior to March 16, 2023, and an increase to 70 percent thereafter, for the Veteran's service-connected PTSD under DC 9411. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
