ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for a bilateral foot disability (pes planus) is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for a neurological disability, to include narcolepsy, including as secondary to service-connected insomnia disorder with alcohol use disorder, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's flat feet, noted on his April 1986 service entrance examination, underwent an increase in disability during his active duty service.

2. The evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran had neurological disability, to include narcolepsy, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for a bilateral flat feet (pes planus), existing prior to service entry, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1153, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.304, 3.306.

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for neurological disability, to include narcolepsy, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Navy from September 1982 to January 1988.

The rating decision on appeal was issued on March 11, 2024, and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the March 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider for the claims of entitlement to service connection for a bilateral foot disability, to include pes planus, or entitlement to service connection for a neurological disability, to include narcolepsy, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.      38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Service Connection

Compensation may be awarded for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. §§  1110, 1131. Service connection basically means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that an injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated therein. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.

Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d). Establishing service connection generally requires: (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004); see Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curium, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a),(d).

A veteran will be considered to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for active service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at entrance into service, or where clear and unmistakable (obvious or manifest) evidence demonstrates that an injury or disease existed prior thereto and was not aggravated by such service. Only such conditions as are recorded in examination reports are to be considered as noted. 38 U.S.C. §§  1111, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).

A preexisting injury or disease will be considered to have been aggravated by active military, naval, air, or space service, where there is an increase in disability during such service, unless there is a specific finding that the increase in disability is due to the natural progress of the disease. 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(a). Temporary or intermittent flare-ups during service of a preexisting injury or disease are not sufficient to be considered aggravation in service unless the underlying disability, as contrasted to the symptoms of that disability, has worsened. See Crowe v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 238, 247-48 (1994); Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 297 (1991). Clear and unmistakable evidence (obvious and manifest) is required to rebut the presumption of aggravation where the preservice disability underwent an increase in severity during service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b). However, aggravation may not be conceded where the disability underwent no increase in severity during service on the basis of all the evidence of record pertaining to the manifestations of the disability prior to, during, and subsequent to service. 38 U.S.C. § 1153; 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b), Falzone v Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 402 (1995).

1. Entitlement to service connection for a bilateral foot disability, to include pes planus (claimed as bilateral flatfoot).

The Veteran contends that conducting physical training in boots with no arch support during service caused his bilateral flatfoot, symptoms of which were arch and heel problems, and that, as a result, he performed poorly in physical training which led to his separation from service. See VA 21-526EZ (November 2023); VA Form 10182 (March 2024). He also argues that he is entitled to a VA examination for his feet. See VA Form 10182 (March 2024).

The Board concludes that the criteria for service connection for bilateral flat feet (pes planus), existing prior to service entry, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1153, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.304, 3.306.

Turning to the evidence, the Veteran served on active duty form September 1982 to January 1988. His April 1982 report of medical examination (ROME) at service entry noted the Veteran had flat feet. MPR at 78 (November 2022). An August 1987 ROME reflects normal clinical evaluation of the feet. See STR-Medical at 71 (November 2022). The Veteran's original VA disability application, received by VA in October 2022, did not include any foot claim. The first, post service, indication of a foot disability is on the Veteran's November 2023, VA Form 21-526EZ, claim service connection for flat feet as due to service. He has not provided nor reasonably identified any relevant outstanding treatment records. VA treatment records, dated 2000 to 2023, reflect no foot complaints or findings for abnormal pathology. See CAPRI (March 2024).

The evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran's flat feet, noted on his April 1986 service entrance examination, underwent an increase in disability during his active duty service.

First, the Board finds that the presumption of soundness on service entry does not attach to the Veteran's feet. His April 1982 ROME at service entrance noted flat fleet.  See 38 U.S.C. §§  1111, 1132; 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b), 3.306(a), (b); see also Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40, 45-46 (2010) (the presumption of soundness applies only when the veteran has been "examined, accepted, and enrolled for service" and where that examination revealed no "defects, infirmities, or disorders."). Thus, the presumption is rebutted.

Second, the Board finds that there is not competent, credible evidence of an increase in severity during the Veteran's active duty service. See Washington v. Nicholson, 19 Vet. App. 362, 368 (2005) (noting that a lay witness is competent to report to factual matters of which he or she has first-hand knowledge); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995) (noting that the credibility of a witness may be impeached by a showing of interest, bias, inconsistent statements, consistency with other evidence), aff'd, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's report that his pes planus symptoms did not exist before service and became so severe during service that they interfered with his ability to perform physical training, which then led to his service separation. See VA Form 21-526EZ (November 2023). However, to the extent that he reports an increase in disability during his active service, the Board finds that this is less than credible given that his service treatment records (STRs) reflect no complaints or treatment for pes planus; his August 1987 ROME reflects normal clinical evaluation of feet and lower extremities; his January 1988 report of medical history (ROMH) reflects that the Veteran denied a history of having or ever having had foot trouble; and his January 1988 ROME at separation notes flatfeet that is not considered disabling. A Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Questionnaire, dated August 2023, reflects that the Veteran was employed as a U.S. Postal Service (USPS) worker, the duties of which included city delivery of U.S. mail, parcels, business mail, and certified packages from September 1988 (eight months after his separation from service) to September 2006, and that he went on to work as a paramedic after that. See VA Form 28-1902w Rehabilitation Needs Inventory (RNI) at 5 (August 2023). The Veteran's work with USPS suggests work that involved standing, walking, and moving. On the same VR&E Questionnaire, the Veteran did not report any foot disability, but did report problems with his sleep, neck, back, leg, and shoulder along with erectile dysfunction and psychiatric disability. The foregoing, coupled with the absence of documented reports of foot problems in the available medical evidence of, tends to weigh against the credibility of the report of in-service increase in severity. Therefore, the Veteran's statements have diminished probative value.

In Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089, 1096 (2004), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held if a preexisting disorder is noted upon entry into service, the veteran cannot bring a claim for service connection for that disorder, but the veteran may bring a claim for service-connected aggravation of that disorder, in which case the burden falls on the veteran to establish an increase in disability during service. Here, as the Veteran has not met his burden to establish an increase in disability during his active duty service, the presumption of aggravation does not attach and the burden does not shift to the government to show by clear and unmistakable evidence that there has been no increase in the severity of the preexisting condition or that any increase was the result of natural progression. Id.; see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b).

On balance, the more persuasive evidence weighs against the claim for service connection for a bilateral foot disability to include pes planus.

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C.                § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Lastly, Board finds that there was no error on the part of originating agency in satisfying its duties under 38 U.S.C. § 5103A before issuing the rating decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802. First, the AOJ had no duty to obtain an examination or opinion in this matter prior to issuing the decision on appeal because there is not credible evidence of an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury. See 38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(c)(4). See also,  Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278-79 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (holding that conclusory lay assertion of nexus is insufficient to entitle claimant to provision of VA medical examination.) Second, although VA's duty to assist normally includes obtaining records in the custody of a Federal department or agency and the record shows that the Veteran applied for social security administration (SSA) benefits, VA had no duty to obtain the SSA records. This is because the SSA records involved unrelated medical conditions-migraine headaches, neck pain, shoulder pain, back pain, hip pain, and knee pain. See VAMC Other Output / Reports at 7 (November 2023). There is no indication that the Veteran's SSA records are relevant to his pes planus claim. See Golz v. Shinseki, 590 F.3d 1317, 1320-21 (Fed. Cir. 2010). (when a SSA decision pertains to a completely unrelated medical condition, and where the claimant does not provide a specific allegation as to why such records may pertain to the case, the relevance standard is not met). 

2. Entitlement to service connection for neurological disability, to include narcolepsy, including as secondary to service-connected insomnia disorder with alcohol use disorder.

The Veteran contends that his insomnia disorder developed as a result of having a varying schedule during service, that he developed alcohol use disorder as a result of self-treating his insomnia, and that those disorders gave rise to his narcolepsy-a sign or symptom of which is daytime sleepiness. See VA 21-526EZ (November 2023). He further contends that his involvement in multiple in-service motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) due to falling asleep while driving is evidence that his narcolepsy had onset during service. See VA Form 10182 (March 2024).

The question for the Board is whether the Veteran has a current disability that began during service or is at least as likely as not related to an in-service injury, event, or disease.

The Board concludes that the evidence of record persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran has had neurological disability, to include narcolepsy, at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the claim. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107(b); Holton, 557 F.3d at 1366 (2009); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007);          38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a)(d).

Turning to the facts, the Veteran's STRs reflect no complaints, signs, or symptoms related to narcolepsy. There was normal clinical evaluation of the neurologic system on the Veteran's August 1987 and January 1988 ROME at service separation. Also, his January 1988 ROMH reflects no history of having or having had signs or symptoms of narcolepsy such as excessive daytime sleepiness.

The first report of narcolepsy is on the Veteran's November 20203 VA disability application. A November 2023 VA-obtained Narcolepsy Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) reflects, by history, the Veteran's in-service sleep deprivation and onset of insomnia. The Veteran reported three MVAs and stated the "he was evaluated and treated for insomnia but has not been diagnosed with narcolepsy." C&P Exam (November 2023). The clinician found that the Veteran does not have narcolepsy. A November 2023 Mental Disorder DBQ reflects a diagnosis for insomnia disorder with alcohol use disorder, which included symptoms of chronic sleep impairment.

Medical treatment records reflect insomnia, which is service connected as insomnia disorder with alcohol use disorder and assigned a 30 percent rating. CAPRI at 1, 27 (October 2019). The medical records also reflect poor sleep suspected as due to chronic pain. CAPRI at 15 (March 2024). 

The Board finds that the more persuasive evidence of record reflects no current disability-a diagnosis of narcolepsy is not shown, which the Veteran himself has acknowledged. The Narcolepsy DBQ reflects that when the examiner asked the Veteran to describe his symptoms, he stated that "he was evaluated and treated for insomnia but has not been diagnosed with narcolepsy." Here, neither the lay nor the medical evidence reflects any symptoms that result in or cause functional impairment in earning capacity. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018) ( "pain alone, without an accompanying diagnosis of a present disease, can qualify as a disability" if it "reaches the level of a functional impairment of earning capacity."). The Veteran is separately service-connected for insomnia disorder with alcohol use disorder, and he has not described nor does the medical evidence show any symptoms that are separate and distinct. Further, the Veteran's rating for that disability contemplate chronic sleep impairment. Therefore, the first element of service connection, a current disability, is not established. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a),(d). 

In the absence of proof of a present disability due to disease or injury, there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).

Accordingly, the claim is denied. As the evidence of record persuasively weighs against the claim, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule does not apply. 38 U.S.C.                § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021). 

Similar to the discussion above, the record reflects no indication that the Veteran's SSA records are relevant to his claim for neurological disability claimed as narcolepsy. See VAMC Other Output / Reports at 7 (November 2023). Therefore, the Board finds that the AOJ had no duty to obtain the records prior to issuing the decision on appeal. See Golz, 590 F.3d at 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (when a SSA decision pertains to a completely unrelated medical condition, and where the claimant does not provide a specific allegation as to why such records may pertain to the case, the relevance standard is not met).
