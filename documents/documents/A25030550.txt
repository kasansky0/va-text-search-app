REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran had active service from August 1986 to May 1992.  

The appeal arises from a rating decision dated on December 11, 2023, with a notice letter dated on December 13, 2023; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

By way of history, in a rating decision dated on April 12, 2023, with a notice letter dated on April 14, 2023, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) granted service connection for PTSD with an evaluation of 100 percent effective August 10, 2022; service connection for arteriosclerotic heart disease with an evaluation of 60 percent effective September 19, 2022; service connection for irritable bowel syndrome with an evaluation of 30 percent effective September 19, 2022; and SMC based on housebound criteria effective September 19, 2022.  In a rating decision on April 17, 2023, with a notice letter on April 19, 2023, the AOJ proposed a correction of the effective date from August 10, 2022, to September 19, 2022, based on clear and unmistakable error, and in a rating decision dated on July 15, 2023, with a notice letter dated on July 18, 2023, determined that there was clear and unmistakable error and assigned an effective date of September 19, 2022.  On July 19, 2023, the Veteran filed a Higher-Level Review claim on VA Form 20-0996, contending that he was entitled to an earlier effective date for the above issues on appeal as he filed his intent to file a claim on March 30, 2022.  

In reviewing a Higher-Level Review rating decision, the Board may consider the evidence of record at the time of the underlying rating decision for which the Veteran requested the Higher-Level Review (as that is the evidence that the AOJ was permitted to consider in the Higher-Level Review decision on appeal), which in the instant case are the April 2023 and July 2023 rating decisions.  As the Veteran in the February 2024 notice of disagreement selected the direct review lane, the Board may only consider evidence as of April 14, 2023, and July 18, 2023.  If evidence was added to the record during an ineligible period identified above, the Board has not considered that evidence.  If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.

The Board notes that the Veteran in the July 2023 Higher-Level Review claim and in the February 2024 notice of disagreement listed the dates of the rating decisions' notice letters, however the procedural history shows he was appealing the rating decisions themselves.  

Issues 1-4: Entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 19, 2022, for the grants of service connection for PTSD, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and arteriosclerotic heart disease (heart disorder); and entitlement to an effective date earlier than September 19, 2022, for the grant of SMC based on housebound status.  

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form.  The amendments also, inter alia, eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen.  See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014), codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155.  The amended regulations apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015.

Under 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(1) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (b)(2)(i), the effective date for a grant of direct service connection will be the day following separation from active service, if a claim is received within one year after separation from service.  Otherwise, the effective date is the date of receipt of claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.

The effective date of an award of increased compensation shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if the application is received within one year from such date; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of VA receipt of the claim for increase, or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110 (a),(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o); Hazan v. Gober, 10 Vet. App. 511 (1997); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); VAOPGCPREC 12-98.

The regulation also allows a claimant to submit an intent to file a claim, and VA may recognize the receipt date of the intent to file a claim as the date of claim so long as VA receives the successfully completed claim form within a year.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b).  There are three ways in which a claimant may submit an intent to file a claim: (i) saved electronic application when an application otherwise meeting the requirements of paragraph (b) is electronically initiated and saved in a claims submission tool with a VA web-based electronic claims application system, (ii) written intent, signed and dated on the intent to file a claim form prescribed by the Secretary, and (iii) oral intent communicated to designated VA personnel, recorded in writing, and documented in the claimant's records.  Id. 

In a July 2023 statement associated with the July 2023 Higher-Level Review claim and in the February 2024 notice of disagreement the Veteran contended that he submitted his Intent to File a Claim on March 30, 2022, for his claims of entitlement to service connection for PTSD, heart disorder, IBS, and SMC based on housebound status.  The Veteran explained that while he submitted a supplemental claim for his left knee disorder in August 2022, his claim was within a year of a prior September 2021 rating decision.  In the February 2024 notice of disagreement, the Veteran contended that he has been assigned an effective date of April 27, 2020, for the grant of service connection for the left knee disorder and thus the Intent to File a Claim received on March 20, 2022, did not refer to his left knee disorder.

On March 30, 2022, the Veteran's Intent to File a Claim, on VA Form 21-0966, was received.  On September 19, 2022, the Veteran filed a claim on VA Form 21-526EZ for service connection for PTSD, a heart disorder, and functional bowel disorder.

In the December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ assigned an effective date of September 19, 2022, for the grants of service connection for PTSD, IBS, heart disorders, and SMC based on housebound status based on the determination that the Veteran's intent received on March 30, 2022, was associated with his supplemental claim received on August 16, 2022, which as explained above was for the left knee disorder.  

The Board agrees with the Veteran's contention that the appropriate effective date for the awards of service connection for PTSD, IBS, and heart disorder is March 30, 2022, as his claim for the disorders was received within one year on September 19, 2022.  The Board finds that the supplemental claim received on August 16, 2022, was for service connection for the left knee disorder; the intent to file a claim of service connection for the left knee disorder was received on April 27, 2020, on VA Form 21-0966; and in the November 2022 rating decision the AOJ granted service connection for the left knee disorder effective April 27, 2020, the date the Veteran's intent to file a claim for this benefit was received.  Resolving all reasonable doubt, the Board finds that the Veteran's Intent to File a Claim received on March 30, 2022, was for his claims of entitlement to service connection for PTSD, heart disorder, and IBS.  Thus, the Veteran is entitled to an effective date of March 30, 2022, for the grants of service connection for PTSD, IBS, and heart disorder.  

As for SMC at the housebound rate, SMC at the rate provided under 38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s) is payable where a Veteran has a single service-connected disability rated as 100 percent disabling and either additional service-connected disability or disabilities independently ratable at 60 percent, separate and distinct from the 100 percent service-connected disability and involving different anatomical segments or bodily systems or is otherwise "permanently housebound" by reason of such disability or disabilities.  38 U.S.C. § 1114 (s); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (i).  

As discussed above, the Veteran has been granted a 100 percent rating for PTSD, a 60 percent rating for the heart disorder, and a 30 percent rating for IBS.  In light of the decision herein to grant an effective date of March 30, 2022, for service connection for PTSD, heart disorder, and IBS, it follows that his service-connected disabilities met the percentage requirements for an award of statutory housebound SMC as of March 30, 2022 (in addition to other service-connected disorders not

currently before the Board).  Thus, the decision herein constitutes a full grant of the benefits sought.  See AB v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 35 (1993) (noting that while an appellant is presumed to be seeking the maximum benefit under the law, the appellant can choose to limit the appeal to a lesser benefit).
