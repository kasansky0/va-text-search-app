ORDER

Service connection for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The most probative evidence of record establishes that the Veteran's GERD was either caused or aggravated by his service-connected PTSD. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for GERD have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.310.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 2011 to September 2012 and again from September 2015 to September 2016. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an October 2020 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). The Veteran timely appealed this rating decision to the Board and requested a hearing with his appeal. The Veteran testified before the undersigned Veterans Law Judge in March 2025. Under the AMA, the Board's review of evidence is limited to the evidence before the AOJ decision in October 2020 and any evidence submitted at the March 2025 hearing or within 90 days of the hearing. 38 U.S.C. § 7113(b); 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(b)(2). The Board has advanced this case on the docket. 

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may be granted on a secondary basis for a disability which is proximately due to or the result of an established service-connected disorder. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310. Similarly, any increase in severity of a nonservice-connected disease or injury that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury, and not due to the natural progress of the nonservice-connected disease, may be service connected on an aggravation basis. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the Veteran and the claim will be granted on the merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b). When the evidence persuasively favors against the claims of the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable, and the claim will be denied on its merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F. 4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues falling within the realm of common knowledge. Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011). Lay evidence can be competent and sufficient to establish a diagnosis of a condition when (1) a layperson is competent to identify the medical condition, (2) the layperson is reporting a contemporaneous medical diagnosis, or (3) lay testimony describing symptoms at the time supports a later diagnosis by a medical professional. Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Although all the evidence has been reviewed, only the most relevant and salient evidence is discussed below. See Gonzales v. West, 218 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding that the Board must review the entire record but does not have to discuss each piece of evidence).

Service Connection for GERD

The Veteran is seeking service connection for his GERD, which he asserts started during service and developed secondary to his service-connected PTSD. Specifically, the Veteran describes experiencing reflux symptoms while deployed to Afghanistan in 2012 and to Cuba in 2016. He stated that his symptoms manifested during periods of anxiety and restlessness. See Lay Statement received April 11, 2020, Correspondence received August 11, 2020, and March 2025 Board Hearing Transcript. For the reasons that follow, the Board finds that service connection is warranted.

Turning to the facts of the case, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of GERD. See September 2020 VA Examination. He is also service-connected for the primary disability of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with panic attacks. Additionally, the Veteran's service treatment records confirm that he manifested symptoms of nausea, gas, and indigestion during and after his deployment to Cuba. See Post-Deployment Assessment dated July 21, 2016. 

As there is evidence of a current disability along with an in-service event and a service-connected primary disability, the outcome of this case turns on whether there is a competent and credible link between his current diagnosis of GERD and either the primary disability of PTSD or his documented in-service symptoms.

Upon discharge from his first period of active duty, the Veteran presented to a VA clinic for treatment for reflux symptoms. He reported experiencing reflux two to three times in the past month. He also indicated that in the past, he was prescribed reflux medication while deployed to Afghanistan. Upon evaluation, the clinician prescribed the Veteran additional medication. See CAPRI Record dated March 5, 2013.

As previously noted, the Veteran experienced symptoms of gas, indigestion, and nausea while stationed in Cuba in 2016. Upon discharge from his final period of active service, the Veteran did not report any gastrointestinal issues, and his relevant systems were clinically normal. See Report of Medical Examination and Report of Medical History dated July 26, 2016.

On the issue of nexus, there are two opposing medical opinions of record. First, in September 2020, a VA examiner reviewed the Veteran's claims file and noted that the Veteran was first diagnosed with GERD in June 2020. Upon review of the Veteran's medical records, the examiner opined that the Veteran's GERD was less likely than not incurred in or caused by his period of service. In so finding, the examiner noted that the Veteran endorsed symptoms suggestive of GERD in June 2019; however, these symptoms manifested seven years after his discharge from the first period of active service and there was no evidence of chronicity of symptoms from his 2012 discharge from service until June 2019. The examiner acknowledged the Veteran's statements that he developed GERD during his 2012 deployment to Afghanistan but found that "some reflux symptoms are physiologic and intermittent symptoms consistent with heartburn is normal and often tied to dietary choices." The examiner also acknowledged the March 2013 treatment note but found that this episode of reflux was diet-related rather than evidence of a chronic disability. Ultimately, the examiner found that since there was a lack of chronicity of care, the symptoms the Veteran endorsed during service were not the first manifestations of his diagnosed GERD.

Contrarily, in July 2024, a private psychiatrist reviewed the Veteran's claims file, to include his service treatment records and post-service medical treatment records. Upon review, the examiner found that the Veteran's PTSD at least as likely as not caused and substantially aggravated his GERD. In so finding, the examiner cited to medical literature for the premise that a psychologically comorbidity was common in GERD patients and often increased the risk of GERD. The examiner acknowledged the September 2020 negative nexus indicating that the Veteran's GERD during service was tied to dietary choices. However, the private examiner found that attributing the Veteran's symptoms during service to his diet, without more explanation was not medically sufficient, as there was no detail regarding the diet in question.

Based on the above, the Board finds that service connection for GERD secondary to service-connected PTSD is warranted. In so finding, the Board further finds that the most probative evidence on the issue is the July 2024 private opinion. The opining clinician considered the Veteran's entire history, to include his service history and post-service medical history and applied the specific facts of the Veteran's case to sound medical principles to arrive at a clear conclusion. Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008) (the probative value of a medical opinion comes from whether it is factually accurate, fully articulated, and has sound reasoning for the conclusion, not from the mere fact that the claims file was reviewed).

The Board acknowledges the negative nexus but finds that this opinion is inadequate to support a decision in this case. The examiner's negative nexus is based on a lack of documented chronicity of GERD from the 2012 discharge until approximately 2019, which, alone, is not sufficient to support a nexus. The Board finds this reasoning to be factually deficient as the examiner did not address the 2016 post-deployment assessment, which documented symptoms of nausea, indigestion, and gas. Moreover, the examiner failed to address the issue of service connection on a secondary basis and the potential effects of PTSD on the Veteran's gastrointestinal system. Given the deficiencies in the opinion, to include the fact that it is based on an inaccurate factual premise, the Board finds the September 2020 negative nexus opinion to be of little probative value.

Accordingly, as the most probative evidence establishes that the Veteran's GERD is attributed to his service-connected PTSD, service connection is warranted on a secondary basis. The claim is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107.
