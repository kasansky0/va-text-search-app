REMANDED

The matter of entitlement to waiver of the $13,900.03 overpayment of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation benefits, to include whether the overpayment was properly calculated, is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran has service in the Army National Guard with various periods of active service in the United States Army. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2022 Decision on Waiver of Indebtedness by the VA Committee on Waivers and Compromises (COWC). The Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) in August 2022. On this form, she selected the Direct docket. The Board recognizes that the Veteran submitted a statement in August 2022 with her VA Form 10182 and requested a hearing. In January 2025, the Board sent the Veteran a letter asking for clarification as to whether she was intending to select the Direct Review Docket or the Hearing Docket. She was asked to respond with her intention. No response was received. As noted in the letter, if no response is received within 60 days of the date of the letter, the Board would proceed to review the appeal on the Direct Review Docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2022 COWC decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the matter on appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) in the adjudication of this matter. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The decision on appeal denied a waiver of the $13,900.03 overpayment of VA compensation benefits. A review of the file reveals this is the sum of two separate debts. In November 2020, the Veteran called the AOJ and indicated she had returned to active duty on April 4, 2020 and requested that her benefits be stopped. In December 2020, the AOJ notified the Veteran that it had received information indicating she had 218 drill days completed in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 (the FY ending September 30, 2020). The AOJ proposed to adjust the Veteran's VA compensation in order to recoup the military drill pay received in FY 2020. There was no mention of the Veteran's return to active service in this letter. However, a copy of a December 2020 email to the Veteran from the AOJ shows it had received the information related to her return to active duty. In December 2020, the AOJ informed the Veteran that it had stopped her VA compensation benefits effective April 4, 2020 due to her return to active service. An internal document ("Award Print") dated in December 2020 shows that a $7,508.40 overpayment was created due to this retroactive termination of the Veteran's VA compensation benefits.

In February 2021, the Veteran called the AOJ and reported that she was called to active duty service on March 18, 2020 and she remained on active duty with an anticipated discharge date of March 31, 2021. The AOJ personnel who wrote the memorandum following the call indicated the Veteran was not being paid VA compensation at the time; thus, no additional debt appears to have been created following this call.

In February 2021, the Veteran returned a VA Form 21-8951 related to her FY 2020 drill days. She reported 205 military drill days in FY 2020 and indicated she wished to waive VA benefits for the days indicated. This form was signed by the Veteran and by a unit commander or designee. The AOJ then sent the Veteran a letter in April 2021 and informed her that it was reducing her VA compensation to recoup the equivalent of 205 days of drill pay in FY 2020. An April 2021 "Award Print" shows a $6,391.63 overpayment was created for a drill pay adjustment for 205 days in FY 2020.

In May 2022, the VA Debt Management Center (DMC) notified the Veteran of the $13,900.03 overpayment, which is the sum of the active duty overpayment and the FY 2020 drill pay overpayment. The Veteran then filed a VA Form 5655, Financial Status Report, in July 2022 to request a waiver. The August 2022 COWC decision on appeal was then issued, which denied the waiver.

In November 2022, the AOJ again wrote to the Veteran. The AOJ informed the Veteran it had reinstated her benefits effective July 2, 2022 due to her release from active duty. This letter also indicated, "We are reducing your VA compensation due to receipt of Drill Pay at the rate payable during Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 for 30 days as reported." As noted, the $6,391.63 overpayment had been created to recoup pay for 205 drill days in FY 2020. It is unclear whether this is an additional 30 days for FY 2020 being recouped and, if so, the reason is unclear. Conversely, it is also unclear whether the AOJ determined that 30 days is the appropriate number of days to recoup, rather than the 205 days for which the debt was created. Further, the number of drill days to be recouped potentially impacts the amount to be recouped for the active duty days served for the active duty period beginning April 4, 2020. A review of the claims file does not show that any letter of explanation related to the debt was sent to the Veteran. Thus, it appears VA continues to collect the $13,900.03 overpayment. The calculation of this debt is, therefore, at issue and has not been addressed by the AOJ.

The Court of Veterans Appeals (Court) has directed that appellate review by the Board on the Veteran's waiver claim must be deferred pending formal adjudication of the challenge to the validity of the debt, which must be undertaken by the AOJ. Schaper v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 430, 437 (1991) ("when a Veteran raises the validity of the debt as part of a waiver application...it is arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion to adjudicate the waiver application without first deciding a veteran's challenge to the lawfulness of the debt asserted against him or her"); VAOPGCPREC 6-98 (July 24, 1998) (holding that when a veteran challenges the validity of the debt and seeks waiver of the debt, the [Regional Office] must first fully review the debt's validity and, if the office believes the debt to be valid, prepare a written decision fully justifying the validity of the debt before referring the waiver request to the Committee). In this case, as discussed above, the calculation of the debt is at issue; thus, the validity of at least a portion of this debt must be addressed prior to the Board's adjudication of the waiver appeal.

Since the Veteran's appeal is within the modernized appeal system, ordinarily the Board can only consider the record as of the decision on appeal. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202(b)(1), (c)(1), 20.301. However, the Board must remand cases where there is a pre-decisional duty to assist error or correction of any error by the AOJ, other than a duty to assist error, in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appeal. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a). Additionally, the standard of "no reasonable possibility" is not fulfilled under the "mere belief that the likelihood" of substantiating the claim is low. See Jones v. Wilkie, 918 F.3d 922, 926 (2019) (interpreting similar language from 38 U.S.C. § 5103A).  The remand must specify the action to be taken by the AOJ. 

In this case, VAOPGCPREC 6-98 (July 24, 1998) essentially indicates that part or all of this debt may not need to be waived because it is invalid, thereby lessening the burden on the Veteran to satisfy the Veteran's appeal. The Board, thus, considers it a correctible error by the AOJ in satisfying its regulatory and statutory duties to fully adjudicate the matter on appeal, as well as the requirement to consider the validity of the debt prior to adjudicating the waiver, and that correction raises a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the Veteran's appeal. Accordingly, remand under the AMA for these circumstances is appropriate.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. In a formal decision, review the matter of whether the $13,900.03 overpayment is valid, to include the matter of whether it was properly calculated. In this decision, the AOJ must consider the debt created to recoup first 205 days of military drill pay for FY 2020; the subsequent letter in November 2022 indicating 30 days of recoupment for FY2020; and how these actions impact the amount of recoupment for the portion of the debt related to the active duty pay for the period beginning April 4, 2020. A narrative explanation of how this debt was calculated must be provided. The adjudication of the validity of the debt should include the appellant's rights related to appealing the decision as to the debt's validity.

2. If any portion of the debt is deemed valid, the AOJ is reminded that there is a pending appeal of the waiver denial.
