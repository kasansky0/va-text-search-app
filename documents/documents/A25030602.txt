REMANDED

Service connection for left knee pain is remanded.

Service connection for right knee pain is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1993 to July 1997.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  

In the June 25, 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims of left and right knee pain, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

1. Service connection for left knee pain is remanded.

2. Service connection for right knee pain is remanded.

The Veteran contends that he has bilateral knee pain due to service.  See October 2023 VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits.

The Veteran's private medical treatment records note his history of knee pain.  See October 14, 2016 Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute ("[Veteran] is experiencing pain in the bilateral knees, right knee. The pain started more than 1 year ago."); and August 3, 2018 Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute ("returns today for a follow up visit for bilateral knee pain, symptoms are worse on the left knee. Symptoms have been ongoing for 3+ years.").

The Board finds remand is required to correct a duty to assist error that occurred prior to the March 2024 rating decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  The AOJ obtained the November 2023 medical opinions prior to the March 2024 rating decision on appeal; however, the opinions are not adequate for the reasons noted below.

In November 2023, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination for his claimed bilateral knee pain condition.  The examiner provided a negative nexus opinion and as rationale stated "Veterans STRS show left lateral knee pain reported in 1993 [and Veteran's STRS are silent for right knee pain]. Post military records reveal knee pain bilaterally for which Veteran has had injections in 2023."  Additionally, the examiner noted that "due to lack of chronicity from service to 2023, the claimed left [and right] knee condition was less likely than not...incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury."  The Board notes the Veteran's October 2016 and August 2018 private medical treatment records were not available for review by the VA examiner.  As the examiner did not have the records, the opinion was based upon an inaccurate factual basis and is not probative.  See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 461 (1993) (a medical opinion based upon an inaccurate factual premise is not probative).  Furthermore, the Board finds the opinion inadequate to the extent that it relied on the absence of medical treatment since service.  See Dalton v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007) (a medical opinion is inadequate if it is based solely on the absence of documentation in the record and does not take into account the Veteran's reports of symptoms and history).

Thus, given that the November 2023 nexus opinions failed to provide adequate rationale, the Board finds remand is necessary to address these deficiencies.  See Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311 (2007) (indicating that if VA provides an examination, that examination must be adequate).  The AOJ's reliance on these opinions constitutes a duty to assist error that must be remedied on remand.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

Obtain an addendum medical opinion from an appropriate clinician to determine the etiology of the Veteran's claimed bilateral knee pain condition.  The clinician must address the following questions:

(a) The examiner must address whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's left knee pain, including patellar tendonitis had onset in service or is otherwise related to his service.

(b) The examiner must address whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's right knee pain had onset in service or is otherwise related to his service.

The examiner should consider the following records: October 14, 2016 Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute ("[Veteran] is experiencing pain in the bilateral knees, right knee. The pain started more than 1 year ago."); and August 3, 2018 Jacksonville Orthopaedic Institute ("returns today for a follow up visit for bilateral knee pain, symptoms are worse on the left knee. Symptoms have been ongoing for 3+ years.").

The clinician is asked to explain the reasons behind any opinions expressed and conclusions reached. The examiner is reminded that the term "as likely as not" does not mean "within the realm of medical possibility," but rather that the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher.

Note that the lack of documented treatment in service, or a long period after, while probative, cannot serve as the sole basis for a negative finding.  Additionally, the clinician must not rely solely on the absence of an in-service finding or diagnosis as the basis for a negative opinion.  The Veteran's lay contentions must be considered in making the determination. [Remand Directives and formatting]
