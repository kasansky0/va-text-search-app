DOCKET NO. 231124-395072
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The appeal of the fee reasonableness decision in reference to the direct payment of attorney fees based on the past-due benefits awarded in a September 2017 rating decision, which granted a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU), is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

A VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement was not received within 60 days from the April 20, 2023, notification letter sent to the Veteran and his then-attorney.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Due to the untimeliness of the appellant's VA Form 10182, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of this appeal at this time. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104 (c), 20.400, 20.402.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran, who is the appellant, served on active duty in the United States Navy from August 1970 to July 1972. 

This matter is on appeal from an April 2023 fee decision issued by the VA Office of General Counsel (OGC) and constitutes an initial decision of the issue of the reasonableness of the attorney fees; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (NOD) and elected the Direct Review docket seeking review of the April 2023 OGC letter.  

The Board notes that because this is a simultaneously contested claim, special notification procedures apply.  However, since the claim is being dismissed, the Board finds no prejudice results to the Veteran in proceeding with a decision at this time. 38?C.F.R. §§?20.400-20.405.  

Timeliness of Notice of Disagreement

The Board shall not entertain an application for review on appeal unless it conforms to the law. See 38 U.S.C. § 7108.  A claim for attorney fees constitutes a simultaneously contested claim; under the AMA framework, an appeal in such cases requires a properly completed VA Form 10182 submitted within 60 days from the date of mailing of the notification of the determination. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.104 (c), 20.400, 20.402.

Here, by April 2023 notification letter, the OGC determined that, "a reasonable fee for [veteran's then attorney] is 0.5 percent of the past-due benefits awarded" in the amount of $608.10.  The attorney was instructed to return $23,515.25 to the Veteran, and "inform OGC that the payment has been completed." See Notification Letter dated April 20, 2023.  Additionally, the OGC letter explained the decision was appealable to the Board of Veterans' Appeals and enclosed a VA Form 10182 and "Appellate Rights for OGC Fee Reasonableness Decisions", which set instructions and a clear deadline that a party has "60 days from the date of this decision to appeal the decision to the Board." Id.  

The Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, received on November 7, 2023, more than 60 days after the issuance of the April 2023 OGC letter.  Accordingly, this NOD is untimely. 38 C.F.R. § 20.402.  An untimely NOD deprives the Board of jurisdiction to consider the merits of an appeal. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (c).  Consequently, this matter must be dismissed.

In sum, the law is unequivocal and dispositive in this case and the Board is bound by the laws and regulations governing VA benefits.  Because the appellant's VA Form 10182 was not timely filed, the appeal is hereby dismissed.
