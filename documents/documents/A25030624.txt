DOCKET NO. 240925-476581
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In February 2025 and March 2025 correspondence, received prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran requested to withdraw his appeal with respect to entitlement to a TDIU.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of a substantive appeal with respect to the issue of entitlement to a TDIU are met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.202, 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Navy from September 1977 to August 1981 and from April 1985 to June 2001.

This appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2024 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which, in pertinent part, denied a TDIU. The Veteran's VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) was received in September 2024. The Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303. If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following the date the Board received the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801. 

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

In February 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the present appeal, the Veteran requested to withdraw all pending appeals and stated that he was satisfied with his current rating. See February 2025 correspondence. While this statement was not signed, the Veteran submitted a signed statement in March 2025 reiterating his intention to withdraw his appeal. See March 2025 correspondence. As such, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal with respect to those issues, and it is dismissed.
