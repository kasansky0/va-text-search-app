ORDER

REMANDED

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for beneficiary travel expenses for lodging associated with travel to a non-VA medical center on September 20, 2024, is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

While the appeal was pending, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) approved the Veteran's request for payment of beneficiary travel mileage expenses associated with travel to a non-VA facility on August 21, 2024.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The appeal concerning entitlement to payment of beneficiary travel mileage expenses associated with travel to a non-VA medical facility on August 21, 2024, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 (2024); 38 C.F.R. § 20.801 (2024).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1969 to April 1972.

The decision on appeal was issued in October 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In his October 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  With the VA Form 10182, the Veteran also submitted new evidence. In a March 2025 docketing letter, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) provided notice to the Veteran that the additional evidence he submitted could not be considered unless he switched AMA dockets (to Evidence Submission or Hearing).  See generally Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023). No docket switch request has been received to date.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.  However, with respect to the issue being remanded, the AOJ will review such evidence in the first instance.

Entitlement to payment of beneficiary travel mileage expenses associated with travel to a non-VA medical facility on August 21, 2024

The Veteran's claim for payment of beneficiary travel mileage expenses associated with travel to a non-VA medical facility for services on August 21, 2024, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending.  Documents contained within the Veteran's VHA claim file show that mileage reimbursements were paid for travel completed on that day.?

The administrative action approving payment for beneficiary travel mileage expenses constitutes a full grant of the benefits sought in this appeal.  As there is no determination remaining with which the Veteran disagrees, the appeal is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for beneficiary travel expenses for lodging associated with travel to a non-VA medical center on September 20, 2024.

In the October 2024 letter denying reimbursement of beneficiary travel expenses incurred on September 20, 2024, the AOJ gave the following reason for the denial: "The appointment associated with this claim is marked as not completed. Since the appointment is more than 2 days in the past the claim needs to be looked at manually to determine if any payment is due or whether the claim should be denied."

The decision letter, on its face, indicates that the AOJ had not fully completed processing of the Veteran's claim, and that a final determination still needed to be made, after consideration of the evidence, as to whether the Veteran's reimbursement claim should be granted or not. Furthermore, VA records indicate that the September 20, 2024, appointment had been cancelled, but there is no information as to who cancelled the appointment or why the appointment was cancelled (or if it was indeed cancelled). In this regard, there is no determination of record by the AOJ as to whether any failure to obtain the September 20, 2024, care or services was due to actions by officials of VA or persons acting on behalf of VA (assuming again that it was truly cancelled). See 38 C.F.R. § 70.4 (a)(5).

Therefore, in issuing the October 2024 decision, the AOJ did not decide all questions of law and fact necessary to the decision, as required under 38 U.S.C. § 511(a). In so doing, it did not provide the Veteran with any appropriate basis for the denial of his claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104(b)(5).

Moreover, despite listing the evidence on which the AOJ relied on in making its decision, including the Veteran's claim for benefits, no such documents including the Veteran's claim are contained in the claim file, which frustrates the Board's duty to decide the appeal based on a de novo review of the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ decision. See 38 U.S.C. §§ 7104(d), 7113; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(a). (The Board notes that a VA Form 10-3542, Veteran/Beneficiary Claim for Reimbursement of Travel Expenses, was submitted by the Veteran along with his VA Form 10182, with a signature date of September 21, 2024; however, this form cannot be considered by the Board and, regardless, does not appear to be his actual claim for benefits as the Veterans Health Administration records indicate that such was submitted electronically on October 1, 2024.)

As correction of these errors by the AOJ in satisfying its regulatory and statutory duties would have at least a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the claim on appeal, the appeal must be remanded. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).

The matter is thus REMANDED for the following action:

1. Associate with the claim file all relevant documentation and evidence considered in connection with the claim on appeal, to include the Veteran's claim for benefits.

2. Make a determination as to whether the September 20, 2024, appointment was indeed cancelled and whether any failure to obtain care or services on that day was due to actions by officials of VA or persons acting on behalf of VA. See 38 C.F.R. § 70.4(a)(5).

(CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE)

3. Issue written notification to the Veteran of the decision as to his claim for entitlement to reimbursement of beneficiary travel expenses incurred on September 20, 2024. Such notification must specify the basis of the decision, to include, in the case of a denial, identification of elements not satisfied leading to the denial.
