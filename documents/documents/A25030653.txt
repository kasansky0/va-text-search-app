REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran retired from active duty after serving from June 1971 to December 1993. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a March 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ), which denied an earlier effective date for the five issues above. In July 2024, the Veteran filed a timely VA Form 10182, Notice of Disagreement (NOD) requesting the direct review docket with review by a Veterans Law Judge.  

A November 2022 rating decision granted an effective date of March 3, 2021, for the five issues above. In November 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996 Decision Review Request: HLR asserting the effective date should be in 1994 or alternatively August 2020. The March 2024 rating decision denied an effective date prior to March 3, 2021. In July 2024, in response to the March 2024 HLR rating decision, the Veteran submitted a NOD as noted above. 

The evidentiary record in a HLR is limited to the evidence considered in the prior AOJ decision under review; the higher-level adjudicator may not consider additional evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2601 (f). Thus, in reviewing a HLR decision, the Board may consider the evidence of record at the time of the underlying rating decision for which the appellant requested HLR (as that is the evidence that the AOJ was permitted to consider in the HLR decision on appeal), as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran during an evidentiary window. In this case, as the March 2024 rating decision on appeal constitutes a HLR rating decision, the Board's current review is limited to the evidence of record at the time of the AOJ's November 2022 rating decision. Additionally, as the Veteran elected the direct review docket, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 2022 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

A Nehmer Court class member is a Vietnam veteran who has a covered herbicide disease. See 38 U.S.C. § 1116 (f); 38 C.F.R. § 3.816; Procopio v. Wilkie, 913 F.3d 1371, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2019). A covered Vietnam veteran has qualifying service on land, in inland waterways, or within the 12-nautical mile territorial sea of Vietnam. 38 C.F.R. § 3.816. To be a Nehmer class member the evidence must also show: (1) VA denied compensation in a decision issued between September 25, 1985, and May 3, 1989; or (2) a claim for disability compensation was either pending before VA on May 3, 1989, or was received by VA between May 3, 1989, and the effective date of the regulation establishing a presumption of service connection. 

If the requirements of the paragraph above are not met, the effective date of the award shall be determined in accordance with §§ 3.114 and 3.400. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400, the effective date of an evaluation and award is based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

A claimant may indicate desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim (ITF) to VA. Upon receipt of the ITF, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in paragraph (a) of § 3.160, appropriate to the benefit sought within 1 year of receipt of the IF, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date the ITF was received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155. 

If an ITF is not submitted in the form required or a complete claim is not filed within 1 year of the receipt of the ITF, VA will not take further action unless a new claim, or a new ITF is received. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b) (4). 

For supplemental claims, upon receipt of a communication indicating a belief in entitlement to benefits that is submitted in writing or electronically on a supplemental claim form prescribed by the Secretary that is not complete as defined in § 3.160(a) of this section, the Secretary shall notify the claimant and the claimant's representative, if any, of the information necessary to complete the application form prescribed by the Secretary. If VA receives a complete claim within 60 days of notice by VA that an incomplete claim was filed, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the incomplete claim (see § 3.2501). 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d) (i).

VA will not recognize more than one ITF concurrently for the same benefit (e.g., compensation, pension). If an ITF has not been followed by a complete claim, a subsequent intent to file regarding the same benefit received within 1 year of the prior ITF will have no effect. If, however, VA receives an ITF followed by a complete claim and later another ITF for the same benefit is submitted within 1 year of the previous intent to file, VA will recognize the subsequent intent to file to establish an effective date for any award granted for the next complete claim, provided it is received within 1 year of the subsequent intent to file. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (b) (6).

If VA receives a complete claim within 1 year of the filing of an intent to file a claim, it will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the ITF. Only one complete claim for a benefit (e.g., compensation, pension) may be associated with each ITF for that benefit, though multiple issues may be contained within a complete claim. In the event multiple complete claims for a benefit are filed within 1 year of an intent to file a claim for that benefit, only the first claim filed will be associated with the ITF. In the event that VA receives both an ITF and an incomplete application form before the complete claim as defined in § 3.160(a) is filed, the complete claim will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of whichever was filed first provided it is perfected within the necessary timeframe, but in no event, will the complete claim be considered filed more than one year prior to the date of receipt of the complete claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d) (ii).

As all of the issues above arise from a rating decision in response to a single Veteran's claim, the analysis below is applicable to all five issues and therefore will be addressed together. 

The Veteran's representative contended in May 2023 correspondence that the effective dates for the issues above should be January 1, 1994, the day after the Veteran separated from service, as the Veteran filed a claim within one year of receiving his initial claim form. The Board notes that pursuant to 38 C.F.R. 3.400, the effective date for a claim will be one day after the Veteran separated from active duty, if the claim was filed within one year of separation from active duty (not one year from when the Veteran received the claim form). In this case, the Veteran separated from active-duty December 31, 1993, and timely filed his claim which included chest pain in May 1994. Regardless of the date of a claim, an effective date generally can be no earlier than the facts found, i.e., the date that a claimant's disability first manifested and the date benefits were authorized. 38 U.S.C.S. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; Delisio, supra. 

The VA denied the claim for cardiac chest pain in August 1994 which the representative asserted was a narrower issue than for any cardiovascular condition for which the VA had a duty to accept, develop, and adjudicate (citing Delisio v. Shineski, 25 Vet. App. 45 (2011)) noting that a claimant is not required to identify a precise medical diagnosis or the cause of the medical cause of his condition. VA has a duty when investigating a claimed secondary disability to identify its cause. 

Delisio held that the Secretary of VA was not required to raise and investigate "all possible" theories of service connection for a claim. But, upon the filing of a claim for benefits, the Secretary generally must investigate the reasonably apparent and potential causes of the veteran's condition and theories of service connection that are reasonably raised by the record or raised by a sympathetic reading of the claimant's filing. In this case, the Veteran was not asserting chest pains were secondary to another condition, had undergone military testing for his complaints about chest pains and as noted below, no heart condition was found. As no heart condition was found, there can be no duty to investigate causes of a nonexistent heart condition.

The Veteran filed a claim in May 1994 which included "cardiac chest pain." The claim was denied because at that time, the Veteran did not have a cardiac condition. The Veteran had a cardiac consult and testing while on active duty. In January 1985 the Veteran complained of chest pain and a routine electrocardiogram (EKG) reflected sinus bradycardia. (There was an additional note which was not legible). In May 1991, the Veteran again complained of chest pain, but the EKG was normal and noted sinus bradycardia.  A May 1991 X-ray of the heart reflected his pulmonary vascularity was unremarkable and the conclusion was no acute cardiopulmonary disease. 

In report of medical history for a March 1993 physical examination, the Veteran noted that he had tightness in his chest and a "pounding heart" when he gets excited. The examiner noted that the Veteran worries due to family issues and work-related incidents and noted the Veteran had excessive worry lasting three to five days. The record further noted that the Veteran had not sought mental health treatment, the condition was slowly self-resolving, and treatment was not necessary. The Board notes that the Veteran has a service-connected disability for an anxiety disorder. A March 1993 EKG reflected the Veteran had sinus bradycardia, a normal sinus rhythm and normal EKG.

An April 1993 EKG reflected the Veteran had a heart murmur, his left and right  atrium and ventricles were normal, as was his mitral valve, pulmonic valve, tricuspid valve, pericardium, aortic valve and aorta. No heart disorder was found while the Veteran was active duty, and the medical facts do not reflect that additional medical testing was recommended or necessary. 

During the July 1994 VA heart examination, the Veteran advised the examiner that he had intermittent chest pain since 1986. The Veteran further advised the VA examiner that he had previously had full cardiac work-ups including normal EKGs.  The examiner noted that the Veteran played racquetball three times per week for one half hour to 45 minutes and did not necessarily experience pain at all during that time. The VA examiner stated that the cardiac examination reflected there were no murmurs, gallops or rubs, there was a regular heart rate and rhythm, and S1 and S2 were normal. The claim was denied noting that cardiac chest pain was not found during examination, and that the medical testing in 1985, 1991, and 1993 reflected the Veteran did not have a heart disorder. 

There was nothing in the Veteran's military record to place the VA on notice in 1994 or currently, that the pending 1994 claimed chest pain reasonably encompassed a claim for benefits for ischemia or ischemia secondary to herbicide exposure. As noted above, Delisio held that the VA is not required to raise and investigate "all possible" theories of service connection for a claim. In this case, multiple EKGs and examinations were performed during the Veteran's last few years of military service, all of which revealed the Veteran did not have a heart condition.

The Delisio case cited by the Veteran's representative was a Nehmer case.  Although the Veteran did not specifically raise Nehmer, as this case was cited, the Board will address it. The record did not contain the Veteran's duty stations from 1971 to 1981. In September 2022, the VA sent correspondence to inquire whether the Veteran served in Vietnam prior to May 8, 1975, or in Korea along the demilitarized zone on or prior to August 31, 1971. The inquiry also asked the Veteran to explain how, when, and where he was exposed to Agent Orange.  The September 2022 response from the Veteran stated that he was stationed in Guam from February 1973 until February 1975, and he attached the relevant evaluation reports to his correspondence. Accordingly, the Veteran is not a Nehmer class member because he is not a covered Vietnam veteran as he had no qualifying service on land, in inland waterways, or within the 12-nautical mile territorial sea of Vietnam. See, 38 C.F.R. § 3.816. Additionally, his claims were not filed during the applicable Nehmer periods as he was still on active duty during the applicable Nehmer claim periods. 

There is no basis upon which to grant an effective date of 1994 for the Veteran's cardiac condition. The August 1994 rating decision denied service connection for the Veteran's claim for cardiac chest pains and the Veteran did not appeal this decision. Thus, the decision became final. 38 U.S.C. § 7105 ; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104.

Decisions of the AOJ are final, subject to certain exceptions. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 3.104. These exceptions include when an appeal is timely filed, 38 C.F.R. §§ 19.52, 20.1103; when new and relevant evidence is received within one year of a decision in an AMA appeal or new and material evidence in a legacy appeal, 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501; when relevant service department records are received, 38 C.F.R. § 3.156 (c); and when a decision is revised on the basis of clear and unmistakable error (CUE), 38 C.F.R. § 3.105. None of these exceptions are applicable. 

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) held that Veterans are prohibited from collaterally attacking a prior final decision by filing a freestanding earlier effective date claim. The Court specifically held that, once a decision has become final, a claimant may not properly file, and VA has no authority to adjudicate, a freestanding earlier effective date claim in an attempt to overcome the finality of a decision. The Court reasoned in Rudd v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 296 (2006) that to allow such claims would vitiate the rule of finality. Earlier effective date claims must arise on appeal from the rating decision granting the disputed effective date.

Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award of compensation based on a new claim (after a final disallowance) is the date of the claim to reopen or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. §5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (q)(2), (r). If there is a prior final VA denial of the benefit sought, the effective date cannot be earlier than a subsequent claim to reopen. See Leonard v. Principi, 17 Vet. App. 447 (2004); Sears v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 244 (2002), aff'd, 349 F.3d 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

The Veteran's representative argues that if the effective date was not 1994, alternatively, the appropriate effective date was August 28, 2020, the date the Veteran filed an ITF. The Veteran filed ITFs on September 30, 2019, and later on  August 28, 2020.  On March 3, 2021, the Veteran filed a new claim on VA Form 21-526EZ, seeking in pertinent part to "reopen ischemic heart disease" claim. The Board notes that there had never been a previous claim for ischemic heart disease. The 1994 claim was for chest pains.  On March 9, 2021, the VA notified the Veteran that a new claim form was not the proper form to review a previously denied claim. On March 31, 2021, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim for service connection for a heart condition.

A claim was not filed within one year of the September 30, 2019, claim, so that ITF cannot be used as an effective date. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155.

The supplemental claim was filed within 60 days of the VA notification that the Form 21-526EZ was the wrong form to reopen a claim. The claim filed on the 21-526 EZ was received on March 3, 2021, and the claim on the proper form was received on March 31, 2021. Therefore, the date of the incomplete claim was converted to a properly submitted supplemental claim effective March 3, 2021. See, 38 C.F.R 3.155 (d)(1)(i).

As noted above, in the event that VA receives both an intent to file a claim and an incomplete application form before the complete claim as defined in § 3.160(a) is filed, the complete claim will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of whichever was filed first, provided it is perfected within the necessary timeframe, but in no event, will the complete claim be considered filed more than one year prior to the date of receipt of the complete claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155 (d)(1)(ii). In this case, the August 28, 2020, ITF was filed six months prior to the corrected supplemental claim.  Accordingly, the effective date for the five issues above is August 28, 2020.

The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. § 20.1303.
