REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from January 1978 to February 1980 and from May 1982 to January 1985.  

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2019 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In the August 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran elected the direct review docket.  He subsequently amended that request in October 2020, selecting the Hearing docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. §?20.302(a).  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the decision on appeal and prior to the date of the Board hearing, or (2) more than 90 days following the date of the Board hearing, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

At the outset the Board notes the Veteran's argument that this claim for Parkinson's disease included a claim for traumatic brain injury (TBI).  While VA has a duty to sympathetically read a Veteran's filing, TBI is not a known residual of Parkinson's disease.  In fact, the argument raised by the Veteran's attorney is that the Veteran's Parkinson's disease was caused by, at least in part, a TBI.  Only a "disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury shall be service connected."  38 C.F.R. § 3.310.  As the Veteran is not claiming that his TBI is caused by his Parkinson's disease, it cannot be considered as part of the claim for Parkinson's disease.  To the extent that the Veteran argues TBI is part and parcel of the Veteran's claims for bipolar disorder, a neck injury, mood swings, and PTSD, the Board notes that those claims are not on appeal.  

Lastly, the Veteran argues that he is already service connected for a TBI as Parkinson's disease is a neurologic brain injury.  Neurologic brain injuries, such as Parkinson's are diseases of the nervous system while traumatic brain injuries occur due to physical injury.  As such, service connection for Parkinson's does not include service connection for a TBI. 

Increased Ratings

Disability ratings are determined by evaluating the extent to which a veteran's service-connected disability adversely affects his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment, by comparing his or her symptomatology with the criteria set forth in the Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  If two ratings are potentially applicable, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating; otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3. 

Separate ratings can be assigned for separate periods based on the facts found - a practice known as "staged" ratings.  Fenderson v. West, 12?Vet. App.?119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21?Vet. App.?505 (2007).  Staged ratings are appropriate whenever the factual findings show distinct periods where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Id. 

Entitlement to an initial disability rating greater than 30 percent for Parkinson's disease with balance impairment.

The Veteran's disability is rated under Diagnostic Code 8004-6204 for peripheral vestibular disorders. In this regard, hyphenated diagnostic codes are used when a rating under one diagnostic code requires use of an additional diagnostic code to identify the basis for the evaluation assigned; the additional diagnostic code is shown after the hyphen. Here, the AOJ rated the Veteran's Parkinson's Disease with balance impairment under Diagnostic Code 8004 for paralysis agitans and Diagnostic Code 6204 for peripheral vestibular disorders. Under Diagnostic Code 8004, a minimum rating of 30 percent is warranted. Under Diagnostic Code 6204, the maximum evaluation of 30 percent is warranted for symptoms of dizziness and occasional staggering.

As the Veteran is already in receipt of the maximum rating for his disability, and as the rating is intended to compensate the Veteran for symptoms of dizziness and occasional staggering, the Board finds that it adequately compensates the Veteran.

The Veteran contends that a rating under Diagnostic Code 6205 for Meniere's syndrome is warranted because he has balance impairment, hearing impairment, and tinnitus.  Counsel goes so far as to state the Veteran has Meniere's syndrome, arguing that the Veteran "has a Meniere's syndrome and warrants a 100% evaluation under code 6205," but provides no evidence of this diagnosis.  The Veteran's treatment records and examinations provide no diagnosis of Meniere's syndrome.  Meniere's syndrome is a distinct diagnosed disability and is not present just because the Veteran has balance impairment, hearing impairment, and tinnitus.  The Veteran's hearing loss and tinnitus have been service-connected due to his military noise exposure.  Similarly, the Veteran's balance impairment has been service-connected as a residual of Parkinson's disease.  As such, combining these disabilities and rating them under Diagnostic Code 6205 for a disability the Veteran has not been diagnosed with would be improper.  Consequently, the claim for a rating in excess of 30 percent for Parkinson's disease with balance impairment is denied.

Entitlement to an initial disability rating greater than 10 percent for speech changes.

The Veteran's service-connected speech changes associated with Parkinson's disease were initially rated at 10 percent disabling from December 22, 2017.  The Veteran was awarded service connection in an August 2019 rating decision based on a December 22, 2017, intent to file.  Therefore, the period on appeal runs from December 22, 2017, to December 12, 2019, the date of the rating decision on appeal.

The speech changes are evaluated by analogy under Diagnostic Code 6516 for laryngitis and a 10 percent evaluation is warranted for hoarseness with inflammation of cords or mucous membrane, and a maximum 30 percent is warranted for hoarseness with thickening or nodules of cords, polyps, submucous related to chronic laryngitis.  38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6516.

In the May 2019 Parkinson's disease DBQ, Dr. G.T. noted that the Veteran had moderate speech changes.

The December 2018 Parkinson's DBQ noted that the Veteran had no speech changes.

Treatment notes throughout the Veteran's medical records variously describe his speech as normal, slowed with normal rhythm and tone, at times slurred, or with normal rhythm, rate, and tone.  There is no evidence of thickening or nodules of cords, polyps, submucous or similar symptom associated with his speech changes.

Based on the above, the Board finds that the evidence of record does not show that the Veteran has had more than a moderate level of speech changes due to Parkinson's disease at any time during the period on appeal.  Consequently, the claim to entitlement to an initial evaluation in excess of 10 percent for speech changes associated with Parkinson's disease must be denied.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6516.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for loss of sense of smell, associated with Parkinson's disease.

The Veteran's service-connected loss of smell associated with Parkinson's disease was initially rated at 0 percent (noncompensable) disabling from December 22, 2017 under Diagnostic Code 6275.  The Veteran was awarded service connection in a December 2019 rating decision based on a December 22, 2017 intent to file.  Therefore, the period on appeal runs from December 22, 2017 to December 12, 2019, the date of the rating decision on appeal.

Under Diagnostic Code 6275, a maximum 10 percent evaluation is warranted for complete loss of smell.  38 C.F.R. § 4.87a, Diagnostic Code 6275.

Both the December 2018 and May 2019 Parkinson's disease DBQs noted that there was no loss in sense of smell.   A November 2019 Parkinson's disease DBQ notes partial loss of sense of smell.

The Veteran did not testify as to any problems with his sense of smell.

Based on the above, the Board finds that the evidence of record does not show that the Veteran has had complete loss of smell due to his Parkinson's disease at any time during the period on appeal. Consequently, the Veteran's entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for partial loss of smell associated with Parkinson's disease is not warranted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.87a, Diagnostic Code 6275.

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for difficulty chewing and swallowing with occasional difficulty moving mandible, associated with Parkinson's disease.

The Veteran was assigned a 0 percent (noncompensable) initial disability rating for difficulty chewing associated with Parkinson's disease under Diagnostic Code 8205. The Veteran was awarded service connection in a December 2019 rating decision based on a December 22, 2017 claim for service connection.  Therefore, the period on appeal runs from December 22, 2017 to December 12, 2019, the date of the rating decision on appeal. 

Under Diagnostic Code 8205, in pertinent part, a 10 percent evaluation is warranted for moderate incomplete paralysis of the fifth (trigeminal) cranial nerve, a 30 percent evaluation is warranted for severe incomplete paralysis of the fifth cranial nerve, and a maximum 50 percent evaluation is warranted for complete paralysis of the fifth cranial nerve.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8205.

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule.  Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120. Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy. See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124. 

Furthermore, VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual (Manual), though not binding on the Board, provides benchmarks for mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe peripheral nerves conditions. Per the Manual, mild incomplete paralysis is described as the disability limited to sensory deficits that are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a small area. Additionally, a very minimal reflex or motor abnormality potentially could also be consistent with mild incomplete paralysis. M21-1, V.iii.12.A.2.c. 

Moderate incomplete paralysis is described as the maximum evaluation reserved for the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment.  Symptom combinations that may fall into the moderate category include: combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate. Id. 

To be described as severe, it would be expected that there is marked muscular atrophy. Id. 

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration. When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves."  The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory.  See Miller v. Shulkin, 28?Vet. App.?376 (2017). 

"Mild" is generally defined as "gentle in nature or behavior," "moderate in action or effect," and "temperate." "Moderate" is defined as "not violent, severe, or intense;" and "limited in scope or effect." "Severe" is defined as "causing discomfort or hardship," "very painful or harmful," and "of a great degree." For all definitions, see Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ (last visited January 22, 2025). 

On both the December 2018 and May 2019 VA examinations the examiner noted that the Veteran had no difficulty swallowing or chewing.  

The November 2018 private examiner noted that the Veteran had a moderate level of difficulty in chewing/swallowing.

The October 2019 examiner noted mild difficulty in chewing/swallowing.

The Veteran did not testify as to any problems with chewing or swallowing.  

Based on the above, the Board finds that the evidence of record does not show that Veteran has had symptoms of difficulty of chewing or swallowing that are equivalent to a moderate or severe level of incomplete paralysis of fifth cranial nerve at any time during the period on appeal.  While the November 2018 private examiner indicated a moderate level of difficulty, examiners around the same time found no difficulty with chewing or swallowing.  The Board notes that the Veteran's difficulty with chewing has progressed and worsened, but the October 2019 examiner found it was no worse than mild.  

Consequently, the Veteran's claim as to entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation is not warranted.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8205. 

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for erectile dysfunction.

The Veteran's claim for service connection for erectile dysfunction was granted in a December 2019 rating decision; he was assigned a noncompensable (0 percent) evaluation effective December 22, 2017, based on a December 22, 2017 intent to file.  Therefore, the period on appeal runs from December 22, 2017 to December 12, 2019, the date of the rating decision on appeal. The Veteran seeks a higher rating for his disability.

The Veteran's erectile dysfunction is properly evaluated under Diagnostic Code 7522.  Diagnostic Code 7522 provides a 20 percent rating for a deformity of the penis with loss of erectile power.  38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7522.  The rating schedule authorizes the assignment of a 0 percent (noncompensable) rating in every instance in which the rating schedule does not provide for such a rating and the requirements for a compensable rating are not met.  38 C.F.R. § 4.31.  A footnote to this diagnostic code indicates that claims for penis deformities should be reviewed for entitlement to SMC.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350 (k).  SMC is payable for anatomical loss or loss of use of a creative organ.  Id. 

Here, a compensable rating for erectile dysfunction is not warranted.  Although the Veteran has loss of erectile power, neither the lay nor the medical evidence reflects penile deformity.  Both the December 2018 and May 2019 Parkinson's disease DBQs noted that there was no sexual dysfunction.  The November 2018 private examiner indicated there was moderate sexual dysfunction.  Neither an examiner nor the Veteran's treatment records indicate that there is penile deformity.  At his August 2024 Board hearing the Veteran did not testify to any penile deformity.

The Board finds that there is no other provision of the code that would afford the Veteran a compensable evaluation for his erectile dysfunction.  Further, the Veteran has already been granted SMC for loss of use of a creative organ. 

Accordingly, the claim for entitlement to a compensable rating for erectile dysfunction is denied.  As the evidence of record is not roughly in approximate balance, there is no doubt to resolve.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

Entitlement to a compensable rating from September 13, 2019 and a rating in excess of 40 percent from October 29, 2019 for urinary incontinence, associated with Parkinson's disease.

The Veteran's service-connected urinary incontinence associated with Parkinson's disease was service-connected by way of a December 12, 2019 rating decision.  At that time a noncompensable rating was granted from September 13, 2019 and a 40 percent rating from October 29, 2019.  The Veteran submitted an intent to file on December 22, 2017 and a formal claim for service connection for Parkinson's disease on October 27, 2018.  The Board recognizes that the claim for service connection for Parkinson's includes secondary disabilities such as urinary incontinence.  Thus, the period on appeal runs from December 22, 2017, the date the Veteran submitted a claim for service connection, to December 12, 2019, the date of the rating decision on appeal.

The Veteran's incontinence is rated as a neurogenic bladder under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115b, Diagnostic Code 7542.  This code directs that the disability be rated as voiding dysfunction under 38 C.F.R. § 4.115a.  Voiding dysfunction is rated based on urinary frequency, leakage, or obstructed voiding.

For urinary frequency, daytime voiding interval less than one hour or awakening to void five or more times per night warrants a 40 percent rating.  Daytime voiding interval between one and two hours or awakening to void three to four times per night warrants a 20 percent rating.  Daytime voiding interval between two and three hours or awakening to void two times per night warrants a 10 percent rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.115a.

Leakage or incontinence requiring the use of an appliance or the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed more than 4 times per day warrants a 60 percent rating.  Leakage or incontinence requiring the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed 2 to 4 times per day warrants a 40 percent rating.  Leakage or incontinence requiring the wearing of absorbent materials which must be changed fewer than 2 times per day warrants a 20 percent rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.115a.

For obstructed voiding, a 30 percent rating is warranted for urinary retention requiring intermittent or continuous catheterization.  A 10 percent rating is warranted for marked obstructive symptomatology (hesitancy, slow or weak stream, decreased force of stream) with any one of the following: (1) post void residuals greater than 150 cc; (2) uroflowmetry, a markedly diminished peak flow rate less than 10 cc per second; (3) recurrent urinary tract infections secondary to obstruction; or (4) stricture disease requiring periodic dilatation every two to three months.  38 C.F.R. § 4.115a.

VA examinations in both December 2018 and May 2019 noted no urinary incontinence.  A Parkinson's disease examination performed on October 29, 2019 noted the need of absorbent material, with pads having to be changed 2-4 times per day.

VA treatment records show the Veteran denied urinary incontinence in June 2019.  An August 16, 2019 social work note indicates the Veteran raised the concern that he was starting to become incontinent.  A social work note on September 13, 2019 noted the Veteran was beginning to have more of a problem with incontinence.  A September 19, 2019 mental health note shows the Veteran was having repeated daytime and nighttime incontinence.  

The Board finds that a noncompensable rating is warranted from August 16, 2019, the date the Veteran first raised a concern about starting to become incontinent.  Further, the September 19, 2019 mental health note shows that the Veteran was having repeated daytime incontinence.  Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that this would equate to the need to change pads 2-4 times per day.  As such, a 40 percent rating, but no higher, is warranted from September 19, 2019.  

The September 13, 2019 note does not provide enough specificity, such that the Board can infer that the Veteran requires the use of absorbent materials.  Further, there is no evidence of the need to change pads more than four times per day such that a 60 percent rating would be warranted.

For these reasons the Board finds that a noncompensable rating is warranted from August 16, 2019 and a 40 percent rating from September 19, 2019.  To that extent the claim is granted. 

Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for constipation, associated with Parkinson's disease.

The Veteran has generally asserted that a higher rating is warranted for constipation with Parkinson's disease. Specific argument in support of this appeal has not been submitted.  The Veteran submitted an intent to file a claim for service connection for Parkinson's disease on December 22, 2017, which includes the claim for associated disabilities such as constipation.  He was assigned a noncompensable (0 percent) evaluation effective October 29, 2019, based on the date the disability was first noted.  The Veteran submitted an intent to file on December 22, 2017 and a formal claim for service connection for Parkinson's disease on October 27, 2018.  The Board recognizes that the claim for service connection for Parkinson's includes secondary disabilities such as constipation.  Thus, the, the period on appeal runs from December 22, 2017 to December 12, 2019, the date of the rating decision on appeal. The Veteran seeks a higher rating for his disability.

The Veteran's constipation has been evaluated under Diagnostic Code 7319, which normally governs irritable colon syndrome.  38 C.F.R. § 4.114.  Under that code, a noncompensable rating is assigned for mild symptoms, such as disturbances of bowel function with occasional episodes of abdominal distress. A 10 percent rating is assigned for moderate symptoms, such as frequent episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress.  A 30 percent rating, the maximum available, is warranted where there are severe symptoms, such as diarrhea, or alternating diarrhea with constipation, with more or less frequent abdominal distress.  The rating schedule authorizes the assignment of a 0 percent (noncompensable) rating in every instance in which the rating schedule does not provide for such a rating and the requirements for a compensable rating are not met.  38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

Here, the December 2018 and May 2019 VA examiners and the November 2018 private examiner all noted that there was no constipation associated with the Veteran's Parkinson's.  The November 2018 private examiner noted the Veteran's bowel movements have changed but provided no further explanation.  

The Veteran's VA treatment records are also absent for any indication of constipation or abdominal distress associated with bowel disturbances.  

For the entirety of the appeal period, the Veteran's constipation manifested as mild symptoms without moderate symptoms such as frequent episodes of bowel disturbance with abdominal distress. Therefore, a higher rating is not warranted.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran's belief that his constipation symptoms are more severe than the current rating reflects.  While the Board recognizes that the Veteran is competent to provide statements regarding his observable symptomatology, he is not competent to provide an opinion regarding the severity of his symptomatology in accordance with the rating criteria.  See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007).  Rather, the Board finds the medical evidence in which professionals with medical expertise examined the Veteran, acknowledged his reported symptoms, and described the manifestations of such disability considering the rating criteria to be more persuasive than the Veteran's reports regarding the severity of his condition. Therefore, the medical opinions hold more probative weight than the Veteran's assertions.

Accordingly, the claim for entitlement to a compensable rating for constipation is denied.  As the evidence of record is not roughly in approximate balance, there is no doubt to resolve.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. 

Earlier Effective Dates

The Veteran contends that earlier effective dates are warranted for all disabilities originally service connected in the December 12, 2019 rating decision.

The assignment of effective dates of awards is generally governed by 38 U.S.C. § 5110 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.  Unless specifically provided otherwise, the effective date of an award will be the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received by VA within one year after separation from service; otherwise, the effective date will be the date of receipt of claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

The Veteran's general argument is that these disabilities were present prior to December 22, 2017.  The appellant, through counsel, argues that there were errors in a previous adjudication which rendered many disabilities still on appeal.  Specifically, he argues that September 2004, June 2008, June 2011, and December 2011 rating decisions involving claims regarding bipolar disorder, ophthalmologic headaches, mood swings, degenerative arthritis of the lower back, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, a neck injury, nonservice-connected pension, atrial fibrillation, a bilateral knee condition, and total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) are still on appeal.  However, none of these issues are involved in the appeal currently before the Board.  Further, counsel's arguments amount to a claim for clear and unmistakable error (CUE) in an RO decision, a claim that has specific formalities that must be followed.  As such, the Board does not have jurisdiction over those claims and will not consider them in this appeal.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 22, 2017, for the award of service connection for Parkinson's disease with balance impairment.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 22, 2017, for the award of service connection for speech changes, associated with Parkinson's disease, is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 22, 2017, for the award of service connection for loss of sense of smell, associated with Parkinson's disease, is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 22, 2017, for the award of service connection for difficulty chewing and swallowing with occasional difficulty moving mandible, associated with Parkinson's disease, is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 22, 2017, for the award of service connection for erectile dysfunction, associated with Parkinson's disease, is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 22, 2017, for the award of service connection for stooped posture, associated with Parkinson's disease, is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 22, 2017, for the award of service connection for right lower extremity bradykinesia and muscle rigidity, associated with Parkinson's disease, is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 22, 2017, for the award of service connection for left lower extremity bradykinesia and muscle rigidity, associated with Parkinson's disease, is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 22, 2017, for the award of service connection for right upper extremity bradykinesia and muscle rigidity, associated with Parkinson's disease, is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to December 22, 2017, for the award of service connection for left upper extremity bradykinesia and muscle rigidity, associated with Parkinson's disease, is denied.

Here, the claim for service connection for Parkinson's disease was received on December 22, 2017.  This is the earliest possible date for the award of service connection for Parkinson's and its associated disabilities.  The Board does not doubt the Veteran's contention that such disabilities were present prior to December 22, 2017, but no claim or intent to file was received prior to that date.  As such, the claims for an effective date prior to December 22, 2017 for service connection for Parkinson's disease, speech changes, loss of sense of smell, difficulty chewing, erectile dysfunction, stooped posture, and bilateral upper and lower extremity bradykinesia, tremors, and rigidity must be denied.  As the evidence of record is not roughly in approximate balance, there is no doubt to resolve.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 16, 2019, for the award of service connection for urinary incontinence is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date prior to October 29, 2019, for the award of service connection for constipation, associated with Parkinson's disease, is denied.

Regarding the claims concerning the effective dates assigned for urinary incontinence and constipation, the assignment of an effective date will be the later of the date the claim is received or the date entitlement arose.  As explained above, the Board has granted a noncompensable rating for urinary incontinence effective August 16, 2019.  

Here, the December 2018 and May 2019 VA examinations noted there was no urinary incontinence or constipation associated with the Veteran's Parkinson's.  

A June 2019 treatment note denies any urinary incontinence.  

The Veteran first complained of urinary incontinence on August 16, 2019.

A September 1, 2019 statement from the Veteran's wife indicates that the Veteran used a chair for the toilet to help him getting up and down from the toilet.  

An October 29, 2019 examination for housebound status noted the Veteran had urinary incontinence.  

An October 29, 2019 Parkinson's disability benefits questionnaire submitted by the Veteran indicates the Veteran has urinary problems and constipation.  

There is no evidence of urinary incontinence prior to August 16, 2019 or constipation prior to October 29, 2019.  No testimony was provided at the August 2024 Board hearing as to the onset of either disability.  No statements suggest the presence of either disability prior to these dates other than counsels unsupported statement that urinary incontinence has been present since prior to December 22, 2017.  

Accordingly, the claims for an effective date for the award of service connection for urinary incontinence prior to August 16, 2019 and for constipation prior to October 29, 2019 are denied.  As the evidence of record is not roughly in approximate balance, there is no doubt to resolve. 

REASONS FOR REMAND

Although?the?Board?regrets?the?additional?delay, a remand is necessary to ensure that due process is followed and that there is a complete record upon which to decide?the?Veteran's claims so that he is afforded every possible consideration. See?38?U.S.C. §?5103A;?38?C.F.R. §?3.159. 

Entitlement to service connection for COPD.

Here, the Veteran claims service connection for COPD due to exposure to Trichloroethylene (TCE), the same chemical compound that was the basis for his award of service connection for Parkinson's disease.  However, the Veteran has not been provided with a TERA examination for his COPD.  As such, remand is warranted to comply with the provisions of the PACT act. 

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for stooped posture, associated with Parkinson's disease.

Regarding the claim for an increased rating for stooped posture, the Board notes that at the August 2019 VA examination, range of motion testing was unable to be performed as doing so would be hazardous to the Veteran's health.  The Board recognizes this constraint but is unable to determine the current state of the Veteran's disability without further information.  As such, remand is warranted for a new examination.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right lower extremity bradykinesia and muscle rigidity, associated with Parkinson's disease.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for left lower extremity bradykinesia and muscle rigidity, associated with Parkinson's disease.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 30 percent for right upper extremity bradykinesia and muscle rigidity, associated with Parkinson's disease.

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for left upper extremity bradykinesia and muscle rigidity, associated with Parkinson's disease.

Entitlement to SMC due to the anatomical loss of the lower and upper extremities.

Regarding the claims for increased ratings for bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, and tremors, the Board finds new examinations are warranted.  The October 2019 private examiner notes bilateral resting tremors that interfere with the use of hands and mild muscle rigidity of the lower extremities.  The May 2019 VA examiner noted moderate tremors of the right upper extremity only.  However, the Veteran described tremors that started in his hands and went up his arms, bilaterally, and continued down into his legs.  Lastly, the severity noted by the November 2018 private examiner is incongruous with the other medical evidence of record.  As such, remand is warranted for a new examination. 

The Board notes the Veteran's argument that he is entitled to a 100 percent rating under Diagnostic Codes 5110 and 5109 for the loss of use the upper and lower extremities.  The Board is liberally construing this to include a claim for SMC due to the anatomical loss of the lower extremities and upper extremities.  This is inextricably intertwined with the claims for increased ratings bilateral upper and lower extremity bradykinesia, tremors, and rigidity.   As such, remand is warranted.

Entitlement to SMC(r)(1) based on the need for special aid and attendance.

Entitlement to SMC(r)(2) based on the need for a higher level of special aid and attendance.  

Finally, because a decision on the remanded issue of entitlement to SMC due to the anatomical loss of the lower and upper extremities could significantly impact a decision on the issue of entitlement to SMC at the increased rate for the need for regular aid and attendance, the issues are inextricably intertwined.  A remand of the claims for entitlement to SMC at the increased rate for the need for regular aid and attendance is required.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Arrange for the Veteran to undergo a VA examination in connection with his claim for service connection for COPD. The examiner must opine as to all of the following:

(a.) For COPD, was the condition incurred in or is it causally related to the Veteran's service? 

(b.) Is the Veteran's COPD due to the combined synergistic effect of the Veteran's total potential toxic exposure in service?

(c.) In rendering these opinions, consider and discuss the Veteran's in-service exposures to TCE and other toxins.

2. Schedule the Veteran for a VA back examination for his stooped posture.  If the examiner is unable to perform range of motion testing, he should estimate range of motion based off his observations of the Veteran during the examination and the Veteran's lay statements regarding his movements.

3. Obtain an examination and addendum opinion regarding the severity of the Veteran's bilateral upper and lower extremity bradykinesia, tremors, and rigidity.  

The examiner is asked to describe the severity of the Veteran's bilateral upper and lower extremity bradykinesia, tremors, and rigidity.  In determining such severity, the examiner should consider the Veteran's lay assertions as to the severity.  The examiner should describe the symptoms in detail and include the rationale for the conclusion as to the severity of the disabilities.
