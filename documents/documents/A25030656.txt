ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is dismissed.

INTRODUCTION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from August 1999 to August 2004.  

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  The Regional Office (RO) granted service connection for OSA by way of an April 19, 2024, rating decision. 

2.  The Veteran initiated an appeal for entitlement to service connection for OSA by way of an April 24, 2024, notice of disagreement. 

CONCLUSION OF LAW

1.  There being no justiciable case or controversy, with regard to entitlement to service connection for OSA, the Veteran's appeal is dismissed.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105.  

In June 2023 the RO issued a rating decision denying service connection for the Veteran's OSA.  The Veteran requested a higher-level review in July 2023.  In an October 2023 higher-level review rating decision, the RO found an error in the June decision and returned the issue for further development.  Thereafter, the RO granted service connection for OSA in an April 2024 rating decision.  On April 24, 2024, the notice letter of this decision was mailed to the Veteran.  On the same day, the Veteran appealed the June and October 2023 rating decisions, requesting service connection for OSA.  As the appealed request was already granted by the RO, there is no justiciable case or controversy regarding entitlement to service connection for OSA.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal on this matter, and the above-noted issue is dismissed.
