DOCKET NO. 240907-470434
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to an earlier effective date for the evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

In a September 2024 letter, the Veteran requested to withdraw his claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the evaluation of OSA.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the claim for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the evaluation of OSA have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.204.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued in September 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.204. Withdrawal may be made by the Veteran or by his or her authorized representative. Id. Except for appeals withdrawn on the record at a hearing, appeal withdrawals must be in writing. 38 C.F.R. § 20.204(b).

In a September 2024 statement, the Veteran stated he wished to withdraw his appeal for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the evaluation of OSA. As the Veteran has properly requested to withdraw the claim, there remains no case or controversy concerning whether the Veteran is entitled to the benefit sought. Accordingly, the appeal with respect to this issue is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d)(5).
