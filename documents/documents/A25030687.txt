DOCKET NO. 200625-503476

ORDER

Entitlement to a rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected left neck scar is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

At the time of the Veteran's death, there was no appealable claim for a rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected scar for which the Board had jurisdiction.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal for a rating in excess of 10 percent for service-connected left neck scar have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from September 1954 to September 1958, and from December 1958 to August 1979. The Veteran passed away in October 2020 and his wife has been substituted as the appellant in the claims that were pending at the time of his death.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. In an August 2019 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for a left neck scar and assigned a rating of 10 percent. In June 2020, the Board received a notice of disagreement from the Veteran listing several disabilities and decisions he wished to appeal. See June 2020 Notice of Disagreement. The left neck scar was only mentioned in reference to being granted by the VA at 10 percent when discussing the severity of his carotid artery disease (CAD). Id. Neither the August 2019 rating decision nor the 10 percent rating were listed in the June 2020 NOD. Id. 

In August 2020, the Veteran, with the assistance of the appellant, filed a supplemental claim for his left neck scar rating and effective date. Prior to his death, the AOJ had not issued a decision with respect to the August 2020 supplemental claim. As the AOJ had not looked at the claim in the first instance, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
