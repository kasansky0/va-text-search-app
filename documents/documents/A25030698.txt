CONCLUSION OF LAW

The issue of entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA emergency medical services provided on December 5, 2019 through December 9, 2019, has been resolved in full by administrative action; the appeal is moot.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Appellant is a non-VA healthcare provider that furnished non-VA emergency medical services to the Veteran on December 5, 2019 through December 9, 2019.  

In February 2021, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal from the appellant electing the Evidence Review docket to review an October 2020 Explanation of Benefits issued by a VA AOJ.  

The claim for entitlement to payment of the cost of non-VA emergency medical care provided to the Veteran on December 5, 2019 through December 9, 2019, was administratively approved while this appeal was pending.  The record reflects that the claim was reprocessed and entitlement to payment was approved for the December 5, 2019 through December 9, 2019, episode of care.  

In a July 2021 letter, the AOJ advised the appellant that the appeal for medical services provided on December 5, 2019 through December 9, 2019, by the Prime Healthcare Foundation Southern Regional Medical Center was approved after secondary administrative review.  See July 2021 Correspondence.  The letter explained that the claim related to this episode of care would be processed accordingly and the appellant would receive an explanation of benefits for each claim paid.  Id.

The administrative action approving entitlement to payment for the entire December 5, 2019 through December 9, 2019, episode of care constitutes a reversal of the October 2020 denial and a full grant of the benefit sought in this appeal.  No determination remains with which the Veteran disagrees and the appeal is therefore dismissed.  38 U.S.C. ยง 7105(d).
