DOCKET NO. 240816-464995
DATE: April 2, 2025

REMANDED

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Army from February 1979 to May 1982. 

This appeal comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from an August 2023 rating decision by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which denied entitlement to a TDIU. The Veteran's VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) was received in August 2024. The Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the August 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of the claim. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability due to service-connected disabilities (TDIU) is remanded.

VA treatment records reveal that the Veteran was referred to a private mental health facility for inpatient psychiatric treatment in August 2022. See August 2022 VA treatment note. VA treatment records note that the Veteran was hospitalized at this facility for approximately one week for symptoms associated with his service-connected psychiatric disorder. These records are not associated with the claims file and there is no indication that any attempts were made to obtain these records.

Additionally, VA treatment records from 2016 onward note that the Veteran has continued to receive non-VA treatment for orthopedic and other disabilities, and medication lists continued to reference active non-VA medications. See, e.g. VA treatment records dated in June 2016, November 2016, January 2017, April 2018, and February 2021. While some private treatment records were obtained from the Social Security Administration, these records end in 2015. Records after this date are not associated with the claims file and there is no indication that any attempts were made to obtain them.

These are pre-decisional duty to assist errors requiring remand. 38 C.F.R. § 20.802.
