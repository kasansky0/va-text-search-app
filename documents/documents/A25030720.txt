ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 20, 2016, for the grant of a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability (TDIU) is denied.

Entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 20, 2016, for basic eligibility for Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. A claim for a total disability rating based on TDIU was received by VA on July 20, 2017.

2. The Veteran was awarded TDIU effective July 20, 2016, in consideration of the one-year look back period, which is the earliest possible effective date.

3. Prior to July 20, 2016, a permanent and total disability rating was not in effect, thereby precluding an award of basic eligibility to DEA benefits.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for an effective date earlier than July 20, 2016, for the grant of TDIU are not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107(b), 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

2. The criteria for an effective date earlier than July 20, 2016, for basic eligibility to DEA benefits were not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501, 3510; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807, 21.3021.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from March 1966 to March 1986. 

These matters are before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a January 2024 Higher Level Review decision of the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

By way of procedural history, in August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a rating decision issued earlier that month denying the above claims. In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior August 2023 decision.

In a timely July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the earlier August 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 20, 2016, for the grant of TDIU

2. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 20, 2016, for basic eligibility for DEA benefits

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date for the grant of entitlement to a TDIU. Specifically, he seeks entitlement to a TDIU beginning January 28, 2015. See July 2024 VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

It is the established policy of VA that all veterans who are unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation by reason of service-connected disabilities shall be rated totally disabled. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16. A finding of total disability is appropriate "when there is present any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation." See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340(a)(1), 4.15.

A TDIU may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total and it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of either (1) a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or (2) two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disability to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16(a).

The Veteran's combined rating was at least 70 percent with a disability rated at least 40 percent disabling from January 28, 2015. Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran met the schedular criteria for assignment of a TDIU as of January 28, 2015.

As it pertains to effective dates, TDIU earlier effective date claims are equivalent to increased rating earlier effective date claims, and thus are governed under 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). See, e.g., Hurd v. West, 13 Vet. App. 449 (2000).

The effective date for an award of an increased rating (including TDIU) will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. If the increase is factually ascertainable within one year prior to the receipt of the claim for an increased rating, the rating will be effective as of the date of increase; however, if the increase occurred more than one year prior to the receipt of the claim, the increase will be effective on the date of the claim. In addition, if the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date will be the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(1), (2).

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. The amendments implement the concept of an Intent to File a claim for benefits, which operates similarly to the informal claim process, but requires that the submission establishing a claimant's effective date of benefits must be received in one of three specified formats. The amendments also eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen under 38 C.F.R. § 3.157. 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.1(p), 3.151, 3.155.

Claimants may indicate their desire to file a claim for benefits by submitting an Intent to File a claim to VA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b). If VA then receives a complete application form, as defined by 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), within one year of receipt of the Intent to File, the complete claim is considered filed as of the date of receipt of the Intent to File. Id. 

Here, the Veteran is currently in receipt of a TDIU from July 20, 2016, one year prior to the date of the VA 21-8940 Veterans Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability, onward.

By way of relevant history, the Veteran's appeal dates from a July 20, 2017, formal TDIU claim. In a November 2021 Board decision, a TDIU was assigned, effective July 20, 2016, in consideration of the one-year "look back" period. 

Here, as noted above, VA received the Veteran's claim for a TDIU on July 20, 2017. The Veteran's award of a TDIU was established at the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability causing unemployability had occurred, which was July 20, 2016. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110 (b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400 (o)(2).

The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veteran's Claims (Court) recently clarified that a VA Form 21-8940 Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability could service as a supplemental claim for purposes of continuous pursuit under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).  Chisholm v. Collins, __Vet.App.__, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336 (2025).   

Generally, the effective date of compensation based on an initial claim or supplemental claim will be the date of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is the later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The effective date provisions regarding revision of a decision based on a supplemental claim are addressed in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h)(1), the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c) within one year of the issuance of the decision.

An Intent to File was received on December 13, 2016.  It was followed by an April 5, 2017, VA Form 21-562EZ claiming service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  A June 2017 rating decision granted entitlement to service connection for PTSD, effective December 13, 2016.  

The VA Form 21-8940 Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability was received by VA on July 20, 2017, listing heart condition and PTSD as service-connected disabilities that prevent the Veteran from securing or following any substantially gainful occupation.

Being filed within a year of the rating decision on PTSD, the claim for TDIU, therefore, is a supplemental claim establishing continuous pursuit of an increased rating for PTSD.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c); Chisholm, supra. 

The claim for TDIU can thus be said to arise out of that claim for an increased rating for PTSD instead of arising from the July 20, 2017, claim for TDIU.  Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-454 (2009).  Nevertheless, a TDIU arising out of the claim for PTSD cannot be earlier than the effective date of PTSD.  As noted, service connection for PTSD is effective December 13, 2016.  The current effective date for TDIU is already earlier than that, July 20, 2016. 

The Board recognizes that the Veteran has specifically argued for an effective date of January 28, 2015, based on his service connection for coronary artery disease being effective that date.  The Veteran filed a claim for coronary artery disease on January 28, 2015.  In a June 2015 rating decision, the AOJ granted service connection for that condition, effective January 26, 2015.  To the extent the Veteran's July 20, 2017, application for TDIU could be considered a supplemental claim for an increased rating for the coronary artery disease it was not filed within a year of the notification of the June 2015 rating decision, which initially rated coronary artery disease.  Therefore, the Veteran did not continuously pursue a claim for an increased rating for coronary artery disease and his claim for TDIU cannot be said to arise out of such a claim.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c); Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447, 453-454 (2009).

The pertinent legal authority governing effective dates is clear and specific, and the Board is bound by that authority. For the above reasons, the evidence persuasively weighs against finding in favor of the Veteran's earlier effective date claim. The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), is therefore not for application as to these claims. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

The Board further finds entitlement to an effective date prior to July 20, 2016, is not warranted for eligibility for DEA benefits as the Veteran did not have a permanent total service-connected disability prior to that date. 38 C.F.R. § 3.807.
