DOCKET NO. 241123-490491
DATE: April 2, 2025

ORDER

The issue of entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 27, 2022 for the evaluation of 20 percent for diabetic neuropathy right lower extremity in Docket 241123-490491 is dismissed.

The issue of entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 27, 2022 for the evaluation of 20 percent for diabetic neuropathy left lower extremity in Docket 241123-490491 is dismissed.

FINDINGS OF FACT

The RO made a favorable finding in May 2024 that the effective date for the 20 percent evaluation for diabetic neuropathy of the right and left lower extremities is the date of service connection for the conditions.

The Veteran's appeal for entitlement to an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for diabetic neuropathy of the right and left lower extremities had been appealed to the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) and remanded to back to the Board under another appellate stream (230802-366968).  Thus, these issues will be addressed by the Board in a separate decision under the aforementioned appeal stream.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of this appeal have been met. 38 U.S.C. ยง 7105; 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.104.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served active duty in the United States Navy from January 1966 to July 1988.

These matters come before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 decision issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  In November 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 disagreeing with the effective date of the assigned 20 percent evaluation for his claims of diabetic neuropathy of the left and right lower extremities.  In doing so, he elected the evidence submission lane under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) system. 

The Veteran contends that he is entitled to an effective date earlier than July 27, 2022 for the evaluations of his diabetic neuropathy for the right and left lower extremities.  However, this issue is now the same as the issue of entitlement to an earlier effective date prior to July 27, 2022 for service connection for diabetic neuropathy of the right and left lower extremities.  

Procedurally, in July 2023, the Board granted service connection for diabetic neuropathy of the left and right lower extremities.  In the same month, the RO implemented the Board's decision, granting a 10 percent evaluation effective July 27, 2022.  A determination for a higher evaluation was deferred to a future time. 

In August 2023, the RO considered the claims and continued its 10 percent evaluation, effective July 27, 2022. Following, in the same month, the Veteran appealed the July 2023 rating decision that granted service connection with an effective of July 27, 2022.  In November 2023, the Board considered and denied earlier effective dates for the two claims.  The Veteran appealed the decision to the Court, which later vacated the November 2023 Board decision and remanded the claims back to the Board.  Therefore, the Board finds the issues of an effective date for service connection for diabetic neuropathy of the left and right lower extremities, earlier than July 27, 2022 are still on appeal but under a different appeal stream (230802-366968).

The May 2024 rating decision on appeal in this docket, implemented the Board's grant of an increased evaluation of 20 percent for diabetic neuropathy of the left and right lower extremities.  The RO also determined that the effective date of the increase was the date of service connection for the conditions.  This is a favorable finding.

As the Board has found the claims for an effective date earlier than July 27, 2022 for right and left diabetic neuropathy are already on appeal, that appeal (230802-366968) encompasses the appeal for an earlier effective date for 20 percent evaluations. Therefore, this appeal before the Board is dismissed.  The Board's decision in this case is binding only with respect to the instant matter decided. This decision is not precedential and does not establish VA policies or interpretations of general applicability. 38 C.F.R. ยง 20.1303.
