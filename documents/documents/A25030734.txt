ORDER

The reduction of the evaluation for degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine with intervertebral disc syndrome (lumbar spine disability) from 40 percent to 20 percent, effective October 3, 2023, was not proper; and the 40 percent disability evaluation for lumbar spine disability is restored.

REMANDED

Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 40 percent for lumbar spine disability is remanded.

FINDING OF FACT

At the time of the reduction decision, the Veteran's lumbar spine disability did not show an improvement in the Veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for restoration of the 40 percent disability rating for lumbar spine disability, effective October 3, 2023, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5112; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.105(e), 3.344, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 4.71a.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran on active service from October 2010 to March 2011, from November 2014 to December 2014 and from January 2016 to November 2016.

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claim of entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 40 percent for lumbar spine disability, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

Rating Reductions

The percentage evaluation of a service-connected condition may be reduced when VA receives evidence that the condition has become less disabling. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e).  A claim stemming from a rating reduction action is a claim for restoration of the prior rating, not a claim for an increased rating. Peyton v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292 (1991); Dofflemyer v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 277, 280 (1992).  

For rating reductions, the law provides that, when a rating has continued for a long period at the same level (i.e., five years or more), a reduction may be accomplished when the rating agency determines that evidence makes it reasonably certain that the improvement will be maintained under the ordinary conditions of life. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(a). However, where a rating has been in effect for less than five years, the regulatory requirements under 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (a) are inapplicable, as set forth in 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (c).  In such cases, an adequate reexamination that discloses improvement in the condition will warrant reduction in rating. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c); 3.343(a). 

A rating reduction requires an inquiry as to "whether the evidence reflects an actual change in the disability and whether the examination reports reflecting such change are based upon thorough examinations." Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 421 (1993).  Generally, a rating reduction is not proper unless the Veteran's disability shows actual improvement in his or her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. See Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 349 (2000). 

Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), where a reduction in an evaluation of a service-connected disability is considered warranted and the lower evaluation would result in a reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments currently being made, a rating proposing the reduction or discontinuance must be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons, and the AOJ must notify the Veteran that she has 60 days to present additional evidence showing that compensation should be continued at the present level.

However, where a rating reduction does not involve reduction in the overall rate of compensation payable to a beneficiary, the due process protections of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) do not apply. Stelzel v. Mansfield, 508 F.3d 1345, 1347-49 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that provisions of §3.105(e) do not apply when there is no change in the overall disability rating). Based on the plain language of section 3.105(e), there must not only be a reduction in evaluation of a service-connected disability or employability status, but also a reduction and discontinuance of compensation payments currently being made.

If two evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for the higher evaluation; otherwise, the lower evaluation will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The reduction of the evaluation for degenerative joint disease of the lumbar spine with intervertebral disc syndrome (lumbar spine disability) from 40 percent to 20 percent, effective October 3, 2023, was not proper; and the 40 percent disability evaluation for lumbar spine disability is restored.

By way of background, the Veteran's lumbar spine disability has been increased and reduced multiple times.  The Veteran was originally awarded service connection for lumbar spine disability with a rating of 10 percent in a November 2017 Rating Decision.  In February 2019, the Veteran filed a claim for entitlement to an increased rating for lumbar spine disability. An April 2019 Rating Decision increased the lumbar spine disability rating to 40 percent. The Veteran again filed for an increased rating for lumbar spine disability in October 2020.  A January 2021 Rating Decision proposed a reduction from 40 percent to 20 percent, and a June 2021 Rating Decision enacted this reduction, lowering the Veteran's combined compensation from 70 percent to 60 percent.  The Veteran again sought an increased rating for lumbar spine disability in December 2021, and a February 2022 Rating Decision increased the evaluation to 40 percent. 

In August 2023, the Veteran filed an increased rating for lumbar spine disability and an increased rating for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In the March 2024 Rating Decision on appeal, the AOJ increased the Veteran's PTSD rating from 50 percent to 70 percent and decreased the Veteran's lumbar spine disability from 40 percent to 20 percent, effective October 3, 2023, the date of the VA examination showing improvement.  The Veteran's combined rating was not affected by the reduction.  In March 2024, the Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement appealing the rating reduction of her lumbar spine disability. 

In the March 2024 Rating Decision, the AOJ analyzed the issue of reduction of the 40 percent rating just as it would a claim for an increased rating by focusing on what the evidence must show for a 40 percent rating, rather than discussing the evidence showing the overall improvement of the Veteran's service-connected disability and how such improvement warrants a reduction. The rating reduction did not adequately detail the reasons for the reduction. Moreover, the Board finds that the October 2023 VA examination, used as a basis for the Veteran's reduction, was inadequate, as it did not provide any estimation for range of motion after repeated use over time nor any rationale for why this estimation was not made. The examiner noted pain with movement ("pain with bending/lifting, prolonged sitting/standing"), but he did not make a statement on whether pain could significantly limit functional ability after repeated use over time in terms of additional loss of range of motion.

The Veteran underwent VA examinations in November 2017 in January 2021 in January 2022 and in October 2023. The AOJ has made reductions and increases to the Veteran's disability rating based on these examinations.  However, as stated above, a rating reduction requires an inquiry as to "whether the evidence reflects an actual change in the disability and whether the examination reports reflecting such change are based upon thorough examinations." 

As the current severity of the Veteran's lumbar spine disability is unclear due to the inadequate October 2023 examination, the evidence does not reflect an overall improvement in her ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 420 (1993); 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.13. 

Accordingly, resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board grants restoration of the Veteran's lumbar spine disability rating to 40 percent, effective October 3, 2023.

REASONS FOR REMAND

Entitlement to an increased rating in excess of 40 percent for lumbar spine DJD with IVDS (lumbar spine disability) is remanded. 

As noted above, the Veteran filed a claim in August 2023 for an increased rating for her lumbar spine disability. In light of the Board's above grant of restoration of a 40 percent rating for the lumbar spine disability, the issue of an increased rating in excess of 40 percent for the lumbar spine disability remains on appeal.

Under Diagnostic Code 5237, Lumbosacral or cervical strain, a 10 percent rating is assigned for evidence of forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 60 degrees but not greater than 85 degrees; or, combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 120 degrees but not greater than 235 degrees; or, muscle spasm, guarding, or localized tenderness not resulting in abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour; or, vertebral body fracture with loss of 50 percent or more of the height. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a. A 20 percent rating is assigned for evidence of forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine greater than 30 degrees but not greater than 60 degrees; or the combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine not greater than 120 degrees; or muscle spasm or guarding severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. Id. A 40 percent rating is assigned for evidence of forward flexion of the thoracolumbar spine 30 degrees or less; or favorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. Id. A 50 percent rating is assigned for evidence of unfavorable ankylosis of the entire thoracolumbar spine. Id. A 100 percent rating is assigned for evidence of unfavorable ankylosis of the entire spine. Id.

Normal thoracolumbar spine motion includes forward flexion from 0 to 90 degrees and normal combined range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine is 240 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  When evaluating musculoskeletal disabilities based on limitation of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 requires consideration of functional loss caused by pain or other factors listed in that section that could occur during flare-ups or after repeated use and, therefore, not be reflected on range-of-motion testing. 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 requires consideration also be given to less movement than normal, more movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, and pain on movement. See DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995); see also Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 44 (2011). However, even though the background factors listed in § 4.40 or 4.45 are relevant when evaluating a disability, the rating is assigned based on the extent to which motion is limited. 

Turning to the evidence in this case, medical records of December 2022 show that the Veteran's low back pain was unchanged but stable. The October 2023 VA examination, used as a basis for the Veteran's reduction, did not provide any estimation for range of motion after repeated use over time nor any rationale for why this estimation was not made. The examiner noted pain with movement ("pain with bending/lifting, prolonged sitting/standing"), but he did not make a statement on whether pain could significantly limit functional ability after repeated use over time in terms of additional loss of range of motion.  The examiner noted the MRI taken in October 2023 for pain management evaluation, which appears to show a worsening of the Veteran's lumbar spine disability.  However, he did not address these objective findings.  The Board is unable to address these findings and relies on the medical examiner to assess this type of evidence. See Colvin v. Derwinski, 1?Vet. App.?171 (1991).

Inadequate medical examinations include examinations that contain only data and conclusions, do not provide an etiological opinion, are not based upon a review of medical records, or provide unsupported conclusions. Nieves- Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008); Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007); 38 CFR § 4.70.

Thus, the October 2023 VA examination was inadequate. Given the AOJ's pre-decisional error in relying upon an inadequate examination, a remand is necessary to assess whether the Veteran's pain could significantly limit functional ability after repeated use over time in terms of additional loss of range of motion.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to address the current severity of her service-connected lumbar spine disability. All necessary tests should be conducted. On review of the record, the examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disabilities under the rating criteria.

2. After reviewing the record, the examiner should comment on the following: (a) whether the Veteran's pain could significantly limit functional ability after repeated use over time in terms of additional loss of range of motion of the lumbar spine; and (b) the severity of the Veteran's lumbar spine disability, addressing all evidence of record, including any imaging testing and findings.

A complete rationale shall be provided for all opinions rendered. The Veteran's lay statements must be considered as well as the pertinent evidence of record.
