ORDER

A 50 percent rating for migraines is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

For the entire appeal period, the Veteran's migraine headaches have been manifested by characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on average more than once a month and that are productive of severe economic inadaptability

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a 50 percent rating for migraines are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 4.3, 4.7, 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably in the United States Army on active duty from May 1982 to April 1986, December 1995 to August 1996, and from July 2007 to July 2008. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a May 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

A 50 percent rating for migraines is granted.

The Veteran contends that his migraine headache disability warrants a 50 percent rating.

For the reasons set forth below, the Board agrees, and a 50 percent rating is granted.

Disability ratings are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule), 38 C.F.R. Part 4. The percentage ratings contained in the Rating Schedule represent, as far as can be practicably determined, the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries incurred or aggravated during military service and their residual conditions in civil occupations. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1. VA has a duty to acknowledge and consider all regulations that are potentially applicable through the assertions and issues raised in the record, and to explain the reasons and bases for its conclusions. Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).

Where there is a question as to which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119, 12627 (1999). However, separate ratings may be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found. This practice is known as "staged" ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

Migraine headaches are evaluated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

Under this diagnostic code, a noncompensable rating is warranted for migraines with less frequent attacks. A 10 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the last several months. A 30 percent rating is warranted for migraines with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on an average once a month over the last several months. A 50 percent rating is warranted for migraines with very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100.

The rating criteria of Diagnostic Code 8100 are considered successive, meaning that a claimant cannot fulfill the criteria of the higher rating without fulfilling those of the next lower rating. Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App.245, 252 (2018). This renders 38 C.F.R. §§4.7 and 4.21 inapplicable. Id. 

The phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is used to describe the nature and severity of migraines, but it is not defined in the regulation. Pursuant to Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 1531 (32d ed. 2012), prostration is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness." Thus, the phrase "characteristic prostrating attacks" is understood to describe migraine attacks that typically produce extreme exhaustion or powerlessness.

The descriptive phrase "very frequent" connotes a frequency at least greater than once a month, as is required by the rating criteria corresponding to a lesser 30 percent rating. Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 253. The phrase "completely prostrating" generally means that the migraines attack must render the veteran entirely powerless. Id. The completely prostrating attacks must also be "prolonged," which is defined as "to lengthen in time: extend duration: draw out: continue, protract." Id. (internal citation omitted). Lastly, the 50 percent rating criteria requires that the very frequent completely prostrating and prolonged attacks be "productive of severe economic inadaptability." Productive can be read as having either the meaning of "producing" or "capable of producing," and, with regard to severe economic inadaptability, nothing in Diagnostic Code 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating. Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App.440, 44546 (2004).

The Veteran applied for an increased rating in excess of 30 percent for his migraines. In order to qualify for a rating in excess of 30 percent for migraines, as discussed above, a Veteran must experience very frequent migraines that are productive of severe economic inadaptability. In the July 2023 VA examination, the examiner found that the Veteran does experience 4-5 migraine attacks per month. Therefore, the Veteran does experience "very frequent" migraines for VA purposes. The Veteran reported in his examination that he has to stop activity and rest in a dark place during his attacks because of dizziness. The Veteran also reported that he misses work due to his condition.  In His July 2024 VA form 10182, Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran reported having 3-4 headaches a week with at least two prostrating headaches per month. The Board finds that the Veteran's migraines also cause severe economic inadaptability. For these reasons, the Board finds that the Veteran's migraines meet the criteria for a 50 percent rating.

The Board is cognizant that the July 2023 VA examiner marked that the migraines were not completely prostrating. Considering the lay and medical description of the headaches, their duration, the documented impact on the Veteran's work, and that the examination reflected that the Veteran took headache medication for their ameliorative effects, the Board finds when resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor that the criteria for the highest schedular rating are met. The Board does not find that another diagnostic code would provide a possible higher rating based on the symptomatology and type of disability. On this basis, the Board grants a 50 percent rating, but no higher, for the service-connected migraines throughout the appeal period.
