DOCKET NO. 220125-213671
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the issue of entitlement to an increased rating for right hip femoral acetabular impingement/enthesopathy and degenerative arthritis with limited extension of the thigh is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On September 16, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served honorably on active duty with the United States Army from August 2006 to June 2014.  He served in Afghanistan and is a recipient of the Army Commendation Medal, among other decorations and awards.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals on appeal from a July 2020 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in this matter.

In February 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the July 2020 rating decision.  In May 2021, the AOJ issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior July 2020 decision.

In the January 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  However, in September 2024, the Veteran submitted a written statement requesting to withdraw his appeal.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.  Here, the Veteran's withdrawal was in writing and included his name, applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  As the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
