ORDER

Entitlement to an effective date prior to June 16, 2023, for the grant of a 70 percent rating for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is denied.

Entitlement to a rating higher than 70 percent for PTSD is denied.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) prior to June 16, 2023, is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is persuasive against finding the Veteran's August 2022 claim for entitlement to a TDIU is also a "supplemental claim" seeking review of the May 2022 rating decision that assigned a 50 percent rating for his PTSD.

2. The evidence is persuasive against finding the Veteran's PTSD as having manifested with symptoms that result in more than occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity during the period on appeal prior to June 16, 2023.

3. The evidence is persuasive against finding the Veteran's PTSD as having manifested with symptoms that result in total occupational and social impairment.

4. The evidence is persuasive against finding that the Veteran was unable to secure and follow a substantially gainful occupation prior to June 16, 2023.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to an effective date prior to June 16, 2023, for the grant of a 70 percent rating for PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107, 5110; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2501, 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411; Chisholm v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336 (March 13, 2025).  

2. The criteria for entitlement to a rating higher than 70 percent for PTSD have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.126, 4.130, Diagnostic Code 9411.

3. The criteria for entitlement to a TDIU prior to June 16, 2023, have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16, 4.19; Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

An October 2023 rating decision granted entitlement to a 70 percent rating for the Veteran's PTSD, effective June 16, 2023.  The Veteran submitted an October 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of the October 2023 rating decision.  The agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the March 2024 rating decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2023 rating decision.  In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 rating decision for the issue of entitlement to an increased rating for PTSD, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  

If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the October 2023 rating decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim(s), considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that this appeal has a long procedural history that stems from the Veteran's July 2022 intent to file and his August 2022 claim for entitlement to a TDIU due to his PTSD symptoms, which was also taken as a claim of entitlement to an increased rating for his PTSD.  See August 2022 VA Form 21-8940; November 2022 Rating Decision.  The Veteran has continually pursued his claims since.  See December 2022 VA Form 20-0996; March 2023 Rating Decision; March 2023 VA Form 20-0995; March 2023 Rating Decision; June 2023 VA Form 20-0995; September 2023 Rating Decision; October 2023 Rating Decision; October 2023 VA Form 20-0996; March 2024 Rating Decision.  The period on appeal is, thus, from his July 25, 2022, intent to file to the March 8, 2024, notice of the rating decision on appeal with the evidentiary record ending October 3, 2023.  

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by the application of the VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § Part 4.  Ratings for service-connected disabilities are determined by comparing the Veteran's symptoms with criteria listed in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities, which is based, as far as practically can be determined, on average impairment in earning capacity.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

If two disability evaluations are potentially applicable, the higher evaluation will be assigned to the disability picture that more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Any reasonable doubt regarding the degree of disability will be resolved in favor of the Veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.

The Board has considered the entire record, but only the evidence pertinent to the rating criteria and current disability will be discussed.  See Gonzales v. West, 218 F. 3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

The Veteran's PTSD is currently rated under Diagnostic Code 9411 and the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.  March 2024 Rating Decision. His PTSD is currently assigned "staged ratings," with a 50 percent rating from May 1, 2014, to June 16, 2023, and a 70 percent rating thereafter.  Id.  

"Staged ratings," or different percentage evaluations for separate periods based on the facts found, may also be awarded.  Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).  

Under the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders, a 50 percent rating is warranted for a mental disability that manifests with occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity due to such symptoms as flattened affect; circumstantial, circumlocutory, or stereotyped speech; panic attacks more than once a week; difficulty in understanding complex commands; impairment of short-and long-term memory; impaired judgment; impaired abstract thinking; disturbances of motivation and mood; and difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships.  Id.

The next higher rating of 70 percent is warranted with occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  Id.

A 100 percent evaluation is assignable where there is total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  Id.

When evaluating a mental disorder, consideration is given to the frequency, severity, and duration of psychiatric symptoms, the length of remission, and the Veteran's capacity for adjustment during periods of remission.  The rating agency shall assign an evaluation based on all the evidence of record that bears on occupational and social impairment, rather than solely on the examiner's assessment of the level of disability at the moment of the examination.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.126(a).  Furthermore, when evaluating the level of disability arising from a mental disorder, the rating agency will consider the extent of social impairment, but shall not assign an evaluation solely on the basis of social impairment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.126(b).  It is necessary to evaluate a disability from the point of view of the Veteran working or seeking work.  38 C.F.R. § 4.2

1. Entitlement to an effective date prior to June 16, 2023, for the grant of a 70 percent rating for PTSD.

The Veteran asserts entitlement to a rating higher than 50 percent during the period on appeal prior to June 16, 2023.  See May 2024 VA Form 10182; May 2024 Third Party Correspondence.

As an initial matter, the Board considers the representative's contention that the period on appeal extends back to the Veteran's original May 2024 claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD based on continuous pursuit for an increased rating since.  May 2024 Third Party Correspondence.  The evidence of record shows that the current appeal before the Board stems from an August 2022 claim of entitlement to a TDIU, which was also taken as a request for an increased rating for his PTSD, but not a supplemental claim expressing disagreement with the May 2022 rating decision that denied entitlement 50 percent rating assigned to his PTSD.  

The United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) recently held that a supplemental claim does not need to be filed with a VA Form 20 0995, and that a claim for entitlement to a TDIU may be considered a supplemental claim for entitlement to a higher rating for a service-connected disability.  Chisholm v. Collins, 2025 U.S. App. Vet. Claims LEXIS 336 (March 13, 2025).  In that case, a veteran was also denied entitlement to a higher rating for a service connected disability which was then included as disability precluding work in a claim of entitlement to a TDIU submitted within the year.  Id.  CAVC found that a TDIU application is a request for higher ratings and, thus, the veteran's TDIU claim could be considered a supplemental claim for VA's denial of entitlement to a higher rating for that same disability as it was a "renewed (or continued) quest" for higher compensation for a previously filed claim for the same or similar benefits on the same or similar basis.  Id.  

However, CAVC specifically noted as part of its holding in Chisholm that it should not be read as requiring VA to accept all TDIU application as supplemental claims and "different facts would warrant a different result."  The facts in the Veteran's case differ from those in Chisholm.  Here, the Veteran contacted and told VA he had no questions about the May 2022 Rating Decision.  July 2022 VA Form 27 0820.  More significantly, in his claim of entitlement to a TDIU, he listed June 12, 2022, as the "date your disability affected full-time employment," which worsening beginning a month after the May 2022 rating decision.  See August 2022 VA Form 21-8940.  Then in the Veteran's subsequent March 2023 supplemental claim for entitlement to a rating higher than 50 percent for his PTSD, he listed the March 2023 rating decision as the one he disagrees with, not the May 2022 rating decision.  March 2023 VA Form 20 0995.  This evidence shows the Veteran had filed his TDIU claim for an increased in his disability during a period after the May 2022 rating decision adjudicates and it is not a supplemental claim that seeks review of the May 2022 rating decision.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the period on appeal begins on July 25, 2022, the date of the Veteran's intent to file, or within one-year prior to that intent to file if it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred.

The Veteran is currently assigned a 50 percent rating for his PTSD during the period on appeal prior to June 16, 2023.  March 2023 Rating Decision.  The AOJ found his PTSD manifested with anxiety, chronic sleep impairment, depressed mood, suspiciousness, and occupational and social impairment due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress.  Id. 

The finding of occupational and social impairment "due to mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during periods of significant stress" would support less than the 50 percent rating assigned by the AOJ.  March 2023 Rating Decision; 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.  This is not a "favorable finding" to the Veteran for this reason and the Board, thus, finds it is not binding to later decisions.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

As noted above, the next higher rating of 70 percent is warranted with occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood, due to such symptoms as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a work-like setting); and inability to establish and maintain effective relationships.  Id.

After careful and thorough review of the evidence, the Board finds the Veteran's PTSD manifested with symptoms that more closely approximates the criteria for a 50 percent rating during the period on appeal prior to June 16, 2023.  

The medical treatment evidence of record recent to and since the Veteran's August 2022 claim show generally normal mental status examination findings.  See, e.g., April 2022 VA treatment evidence; October 2022 VA treatment evidence; January 2023 VA treatment evidence.  He was observed to be smiling and laughing during an April 2022 treatment visit and reported doing better due to a change in his work schedule from nights to days and use of psychiatric medication.  April 2022 VA treatment evidence.  He reported being able to go to the gym and shopping and having supportive family or friends.  January 2023 VA treatment evidence.  There was evidence of depressed mood or irritability during some visits.  See October 2022 VA treatment evidence; December 2022 VA treatment evidence.  This evidence suggests much less than the findings by the AOJ and would support no more than a 30 percent rating.  See March 2023 Rating Decision; 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

The Veteran was afforded August 2022 and June 2023 VA examinations for his PTSD during the period on appeal.  The VA examiners had an opportunity the examine the Veteran, review the evidence available that time, and provided detailed reports with relevant findings.  Their findings and opinion are probative for these reasons.

The August 2022 VA examiner's finding suggest more severe PTSD symptoms than the medical treatment evidence.  The VA examiner found the Veteran's PTSD manifested with symptoms such as intrusive thoughts, avoidance behavior, problems sleeping, persistent negative emotional states, markedly diminished interest in activities, feelings of detachment, hypervigilance, anger outburst without provocation, depressed mood, and anxiety.  August 2022 VA Examination for PTSD.  He reported only bathing and grooming once a week due to lack of motivation, and the VA examiner noted he was "dressed sloppily."  Id.  But he was noted to have an organized and logical thought despite impaired short-term memory, and that he was cooperative during the examination.  Id.  He also reported still having social support from nearby family and able to complete activities of daily living.  Id.  The VA examiner opines the Veteran would have mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during period of significant stress.  See id.  

The Board finds the August 2022 VA examiner's findings suggest greater than mild or transient symptoms but no more than reduced reliability and productivity.  His symptoms such as persistent negative emotional state, impaired short-term memory, and markedly diminished interest in activities support more than mild or transient symptoms.  But his normal thought process, ability to be cooperative, and retention of at least one family or friend suggest his symptoms did not rise to the level of causing deficiencies in most areas of work, social relationships, and ability to care for himself.  While he was noted as being dressed sloppily, there was no mention of problems with hygiene and he was noted to complete his activities of daily living independently.  The Veteran reports problems with anger outburst, but there is no evidence it has resulted in period of violence.  This evidence supports reduced reliability and productivity, but persuasive against finding that there are deficiencies in most areas of his occupational and social ability.     

The first probative evidence of more significant symptoms was during his June 2023 VA examination for PTSD.  The VA examiner found similar findings to the August 2022 VA examiner but also found symptoms such as panic attacks more than once a week and retention of only highly learned material and forgetting to complete tasks.  June 2023 VA Examination for PTSD.  He now also reported no social network.  Id.  This suggests the Veteran's PTSD symptoms worsened by the time of his June 16, 2023, VA examination.

The Board considered the Veteran's report, and the representative's contention, that his PTSD symptoms include being a danger to himself or others, mania, has difficulty thinking or has illogical thought process, is disorientated and has trouble navigating places, is unable to make or keep friends and neglect of family, and neglect of chores and tasks.  See June 2023 Third Party Correspondence; June 2023 Correspondence; May 2024 Third Party Correspondence.  However, neither the medical treatment evidence of record nor the August 2022 VA examiner's findings support these symptoms.  Rather, he has always been noted during the period on appeal to be orientated with no evidence of psychosis, having normal speech and thought process, and as cooperative.  He reported during the August 2022 VA examination that he is able to complete his chores, i.e. activities of daily living, and had a least one family or friend for support.  This is also more consistent with the medical treatment evidence that shows he was going to the gym and could go shopping.  January 2023 VA treatment evidence.  In weighing and balancing the veracity of the Veteran's statements, the Board finds that the statements of the Veteran made to his health care providers to be more probative as they were made while seek medical treatment.  See Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 512 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996); Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 73 (1997).  Moreover, the Board finds the longitudinal medical evidence to be probative than the Veteran's statement on a checkbox form then repeated in the representative's contentions.  For these reasons, the Board finds the Veteran's June 2023 lay statement to not be probative and the representative's contention to have no merit.

The Board considered the representative's other contentions, but finds they are general arguments which no specific indication on how they apply to the Veteran's case.  For example, the representative suggest that the VA examinations are inadequate with no indication as to why.  June 2023 Third Party Correspondence; May 2024 Third Party Correspondence.  They also argue "Deluca Failure" and "obesity as an intermediate step" despite no issue involving range of motion being on appeal or a claim for service connection.  See June 2023 Third Party Correspondence; May 2024 Third Party Correspondence.  The Board finds the representative's other contentions to have no merit as well.

The Board finds that the medical evidence supports that his PTSD manifested with symptoms that at most supports the criteria for a 50 percent rating prior to June 16, 2023.  Accordingly, entitlement to a 70 percent rating prior to June 16, 2023, is not warranted.   

2. Entitlement to a rating higher than 70 percent for PTSD.

The Veteran asserts entitlement to a rating higher than 70 percent for his PTSD.  May 2024 VA Form 10182.  His representative contends that he is in danger of hurting himself or others, has difficulty with his thought process, understanding instructions, and has symptoms such as hypervigilance, panic attacks, and persistent suicidal ideation.  May 2024 Third Party Correspondence.

The AOJ found the Veteran's PTSD to have manifested during the period on appeal with, at most:  anxiety, chronic sleep impairment; depressed mood; difficulty adapting to worklike setting; difficulty adapting to stressful circumstances; difficulty adapting to work; difficulty in establishing and maintaining effective work and social relationships; disturbances of motivation and mood; flattened affect; forgetting directions; forgetting names; forgetting recent events; forgetting to complete tasks; impairment of short- and long-term memory; mild memory loss; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity; panic attack s more than once a week; retention of only highly learned material; suspiciousness.  See November 2022 Rating Decision; March 2023 Rating Decision; March 2023 Rating Decision; September 2024 Rating Decision; March 2024 Rating Decision.  

The finding of occupational and social impairment "with reduced reliability and productivity" in the AOJ's September 2023 and March 2024 rating decisions would support a disability rating less than the 70 percent assigned in each decision.  These are not a "favorable finding" to the Veteran for this reason and the Board, thus, finds it is not binding to later decisions.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

After careful and thorough review of the evidence, the Board finds the evidence persuasive against finding the Veteran's PTSD has manifested with total occupational and social impairment at any time during the period on appeal.

As noted above, a 100 percent evaluation is assignable where a service-connected mental health disability or disabilities result in  total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation, or own name.  38 C.F.R. § 4.130.  

The medical treatment evidence of record recent to and since the Veteran's August 2022 claim shows much less than total occupational and social impairment due to his PTSD symptoms.  Rather, treatment providers have noted generally normal mental status examination findings.  See, e.g., April 2022 VA treatment evidence; October 2022 VA treatment evidence; January 2023 VA treatment evidence.  He was noted to be smiling and laughing during an April 2022 treatment visit and reported doing better due to a change in his work schedule from nights to days and use of psychiatric medication.  April 2022 VA treatment evidence.  He was later noted with symptoms such as depressed mood or irritability but reported being able to do activities such as going to the gym and shopping and having supportive family and/or friends in his life.  See October 2022 VA treatment evidence; December 2022 VA treatment evidence; January 2023 VA treatment evidence.  The medical treatment evidence showed no evidence that he was unable to do his activities of daily living or being a persistent danger to himself or others.  It suggests even less severe symptoms than those found by the AOJ.  See September 2023 Rating Decision; March 2024 Rating Decision.  This evidence suggest he can communicate effectively with others and had at least one social relationship, which is against finding the Veteran had total occupational and social impairment.

The Veteran was afforded August 2022 and June 2023 VA examinations for his PTSD during the period on appeal.  The VA examiners had an opportunity the examine the Veteran, review the evidence available that time, and provided detailed reports with relevant findings.  Their findings and opinion are probative for these reasons.

The August 2022 VA examiner found his PTSD manifested with symptoms such as intrusive thoughts, avoidance behavior, problems sleeping, persistent negative emotional states, markedly diminished interest in activities, feelings of detachment, hypervigilance, anger outburst without provocation, depressed mood, and anxiety.  August 2022 VA Examination for PTSD.  He reported only bathing and grooming once a week due to lack of motivation, and the VA examiner noted he was "dressed sloppily."  Id.  But he was noted to have an organized and logical thought despite impaired short-term memory, and that he was cooperative during the examination.  Id.  He reported still having social support from nearby family.  Id.  The VA examiner opines the Veteran would have mild or transient symptoms which decrease work efficiency and ability to perform occupational tasks only during period of significant stress.  See id.  While the August 2022 VA examiner's findings and opinion suggest more restriction from the Veteran's PTSD than the medical treatment evidence, they are still against finding total occupational and social impairment.

The June 2023 VA examiner found similar findings to the August 2022 VA examiner but also found symptoms such as panic attacks more than once a week, retention of only highly learned material and forgetting to complete tasks, difficulty establishing effective relationships and adapting to stressful circumstances.  June 2023 VA Examination for PTSD.  He now reported no social network.  Id.  There was no finding of hallucinations, he was engaged throughout the examination, and was able to quickly establish rapport with the examiner.  See id.  The June 2023 VA examiner opined the Veteran's symptoms would cause occupational and social impairment with reduced reliability and productivity.  Id.  The June 2023 VA examiner's findings and opinion suggest worsening symptoms since the August 2022 VA examination and that he would be restricted in his ability to work, but they are still against the level of total occupational and social impairment.

The Board finds the August 2022 and June 2023 VA examiners' findings and opinion to also be persuasive against finding a 100 percent rating is warranted for the Veteran's PTSD.

The Board considered the Veteran's report, and the representative's contention, that his PTSD symptoms include being a danger to himself or others, mania, has difficulty thinking or has illogical thought process, and is disorientated and has trouble navigating places.  See June 2023 Third Party Correspondence; June 2023 Correspondence; May 2024 Third Party Correspondence.  However, neither the medical treatment evidence of record nor the August 2022 and June 2023 VA examiners' findings support these symptoms.  Rather, he has always been noted during the period on appeal to be orientated with no evidence of psychosis, having normal speech and thought process, and as cooperative.  In weighing and balancing the veracity of the Veteran's statements, the Board finds that the statements of the Veteran made to his health care providers to be more probative as they were made while seek medical treatment.  See Caluza, 7 Vet. App. at 512; Rucker, 10 Vet. App. at 73.  Moreover, the Board finds the longitudinal medical evidence to be probative than the Veteran's statement on a checkbox form then repeated in the representative's contentions.  For these reasons, the Board finds the Veteran's June 2023 lay statement to not be probative and the representative's contention to have no merit.

The Board considered the representative's other contentions, but they are general arguments which no specific indication on how they apply to the Veteran's case.  For example, the representative suggest that the VA examinations are inadequate with no indication as to why.  June 2023 Third Party Correspondence; May 2024 Third Party Correspondence.  They also argue "Deluca Failure" and "obesity as an intermediate step" despite no issue involving range of motion being on appeal or a claim for service connection.  See June 2023 Third Party Correspondence; May 2024 Third Party Correspondence.  The Board finds the representative's other contentions to have no merit as well. 

The Board finds the more probative lay and medical evidence to be persuasive against finding his PTSD has manifested with symptoms that more closely approximates total occupational and social impairment.  Accordingly, entitlement to a rating higher than 70 percent for PTSD is not warranted.

3. Entitlement to a TDIU prior to June 16, 2023.

The Veteran was granted entitlement to a TDIU, effective June 16, 2023.  October 2023 Rating Decision.  He asserts entitlement to a TDIU prior to June 16, 2023, as part and parcel with his claim of entitlement to an increased rating for PTSD.  May 2024 Third Party Correspondence.

A total disability rating may be assigned, where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as the result of service-connected disabilities.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

To qualify for a total rating for compensation purposes, the evidence must show that a veteran is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of his service-connected disabilities, and there is one disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or, if more than one disability, at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more with a combined disability rating of 70 percent or more.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).

The central inquiry is whether the Veteran's service-connected disabilities alone were of sufficient severity to produce unemployability.  Hatlestad v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 524 (1993).  Consideration may be given to the Veteran's education, special training, and previous work experience, but not to age or to the impairment caused by non-service-connected disabilities.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.341, 4.16, 4.19.

The sole fact that a claimant is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough.  A high rating is recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain or keep employment.  The ultimate question is whether a veteran can perform the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether he or she can find employment.  Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 361 (1993).

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

The AOJ found the entitlement to a TDIU, effective June 16, 2023, based on the date of the June 2023 VA examination for PTSD, which included findings of intrusive memories and panic attacks that would limit employment in sedentary and more physical jobs.  October 2023 Rating Decision. 

The Veteran had at least one disability ratable at 40 percent or more with a combined disability rating of 70 percent or more during the period on appeal prior to June 16, 2023.  38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a).  

The Veteran has a high school education and an associate's degree in fashion merchandising.  August 2022 VA Form 21 8940.  He last worked full-time on June 12, 2022, as a security guard.  Id.

He does not asserted limitations in his ability to work due to his tinnitus, hearing loss, or keloid scars; nor does the evidence suggest they would limit his ability to work.  December 2014 VA Examination for Hearing Loss and Tinnitus; December 2014 VA Examination for Scars; August 2022 VA Form 21-8940.

The remaining question for the Board is whether the Veteran was unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation due to his service connected PTSD for the period prior to June 16, 2023.

The medical treatment records shows that the Veteran reported his job as a security guard "isn't stressful, but maintaining it is."  August 2021 VA treatment evidence.  He was able to continue working at his job with his PTSD symptoms and even reported improvement when he switched to a daytime work schedule instead of a night, but still hoping his VA disability benefits will allow him to stop working.  See December 2021 VA treatment evidence; April 2022 VA treatment evidence.  He reported to his treatment provider that he got along with his coworkers and supervisors, but his PTSD would "spacing out," which was a problem as a security guard, and he would at times feel anxious and pressured speech.  October 2022 VA treatment evidence.  He reported improvement in his symptoms and was able to go to the gym and shop, make plans for the future, and using positive coping strategies.  January 2023 VA treatment evidence.  This evidence supports that the Veteran has no physical limitations and would be able to work a job that has a daytime schedule with limited coworker interaction, no public contact, and did not require constant vigilance or pace work such as a security guard or on an assembly line to allow any time "spacing out."

An August 2022 VA examination for PTSD noted evidence of symptoms such as intrusive thoughts, memory problems, persistent negative emotional state, markedly diminished interest, irritability, angry outbursts, sleep problems, anxiety, and problems with his dress.  The August 2022 VA examiner found the Veteran may have trouble getting along with coworkers and could not do complex tasks but is still able to do any jobs limited to 1-2 step tasks.  Id.  The VA examiner is a medical professional qualified to evaluate the severity of PTSD, who had the opportunity to examine the Veteran and provided a detail report in support of the opinion.  The Board finds the August 2022 VA examiner's findings and opinions to be probative for these reasons and persuasive against finding that the Veteran's PTSD would preclude him from all substantially gainful occupations.  

The Board considered the Veteran's report during the June 2023 VA examination for PTSD that he lost his job as a security guard in June 2022 due to absenteeism, irritability, and trouble getting along with coworkers.  But as noted above, the Veteran reported to his treatment provider just after leaving that job about generally getting along with his coworkers and management.  October 2022 VA treatment evidence.  He reported "spacing out" but not that he did not show up to work.  Id.  There is no indication in the evidence of record that he left that job involuntarily and employment records indicates that he left his prior security guard job ending 2020 voluntarily.  October 2022 VA Form 21-4192.  The Board finds the Veteran's report of absenteeism and trouble getting along with coworkers at his most recent job ending in 2022 to not be probative for these reasons.    

The Board considered the Veteran's report, and the representative's contention, that his PTSD symptoms include being a danger to himself or others, mania, difficulty thinking or illogical thought process, and disorientated and trouble navigating places.  See June 2023 Third Party Correspondence; June 2023 Correspondence; May 2024 Third Party Correspondence.  However, neither the medical treatment evidence of record nor the August 2022 and June 2023 VA examiners' findings support these symptoms.  Rather, he has always been noted during the period on appeal to be orientated with no evidence of psychosis, having normal speech and thought process, and as cooperative.  In weighing and balancing the veracity of the Veteran's statements, the Board finds that the statements of the Veteran made to his health care providers to be more probative as they were made while seek medical treatment.  See Caluza, 7 Vet. App. at 512; Rucker, 10 Vet. App. at 73.  Moreover, the Board finds the longitudinal medical evidence to be probative than the Veteran's statement on a checkbox form then repeated in the representative's contentions.  For these reasons, the Board finds the Veteran's June 2023 lay statement to not be probative and the representative's contention to have no merit.

Based on the more probative lay and medical evidence, the Board finds the Veteran's PTSD symptoms limited the Veteran to jobs that have a daytime schedule with limited coworker interaction, 1-2 step tasks, no public contact, and do not require constant vigilance or pace work such as a security guard or on an assembly line to allow any time "spacing out" during the period on appeal prior to June 16, 2023.  The Veteran has no physical limitations from his service-connected disabilities and would otherwise be able to secure and maintain a job.  

Accordingly, entitlement to a TDIU prior to June 16, 2023, is not warranted.
