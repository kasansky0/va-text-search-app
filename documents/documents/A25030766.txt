DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for myasthenia gravis is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, myasthenia gravis is at least as likely as not related to exposure to chemicals in service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for myasthenia gravis are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 2006 to September 2008. This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued April 2024 by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In February and March 2024, the Veteran submitted two VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of an October 2023 decision. In April 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior October 2023 decision. 

In the July 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 AOJ decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

Entitlement to service connection for myasthenia gravis.

The Veteran contends that he developed myasthenia gravis as a result of chemical exposure during service.

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303. The three-element test for service connection requires evidence of: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1166 -67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

The rating decision on appeal reflects that the AOJ favorably found that the Veteran was diagnosed with a disability, specifically myasthenia gravis as noted in a July 2023 VA examination; and that the Veteran participated in a toxic exposure risk activity based on the Veteran's military occupational specialty (MOS) of chemical operations specialist.

Accordingly, the remaining inquiry is whether the Veteran's diagnosed myasthenia gravis is etiologically related to service, to include toxic exposures due to the Veteran's MOS. Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran has a current disability that is related to toxic exposures in service. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 5107(b); Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2009); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

In support of the claim, the Veteran submitted an opinion dated May 2023 from his private provider stating there is a strong possibility that the Veteran's myasthenia gravis was caused by his service as a chemical operations specialist. The Board notes that this is not the standard of proof applicable to this appeal.

The record also includes VA opinions from July, August, and October 2023. However, none of the opinions adequately address the etiology of the Veteran's disability. The July 2023 and August 2023 opinions were based on the inaccurate factual premise that the Veteran did not have exposure to toxic chemicals in service. The October 2023 VA opinion is conclusory and lacked adequate rationale to support the findings expressed.

The Board has considered whether a remand to seek an adequate, non-speculative opinion is warranted, but finds that such is unnecessary. Instead, in consideration of the complete record and when resolving reasonable doubt, the Board finds that the criteria for service connection are met. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
