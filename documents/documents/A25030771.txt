REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served in the U.S. Army from August 2000 to November 2005.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2023 rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).

In his March 18, 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.

1. Reduction in rating for left knee instability from 20 percent disabling to 10 percent effective December 14, 2023.

2. Reduction in rating for right knee chondrosis with meniscal tear from 10 percent disabling to a noncompensable evaluation effective November 30, 2023.

On December 3, 2024, the Veteran's attorney notified the Board that the Veteran wished to withdraw the above-listed appeals.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative. Id. 

In the present case, the Veteran's attorney informed the Board on December 3, 2024, that the Veteran wished to withdraw his appeals of the reduction in rating for his left knee instability to 10 percent effective December 14, 2023, and the reduction in rating for his right knee chondrosis with meniscal tear to 0 percent effective November 30, 2023. See December 2024 VA Form 20-10208, Document/Evidence Submission. 

Accordingly, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. 

The appeal is dismissed.
