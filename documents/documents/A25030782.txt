ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for depression is denied.

Entitlement to service connection for dementia is denied.  

REMANDED

Entitlement to service connection for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is remanded.

Entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran has not had a diagnosis of depression that conforms to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5).

2. The persuasive evidence is against the claim that dementia was incurred in service or otherwise related to service, to include toxic exposure risk activity (TERA).

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for depression have not been met.  38U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.310.  

2. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for dementia have not been met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131, 1168, 5103, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from September 1970 to September 1972.  This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2022 rating decision from a Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) under the modernized appeals system known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).  

The Veteran requested the hearing docket at the Board, specifically requesting a video hearing before a Veterans Law Judge (VLJ) in his January 2023 VA Form 10182.  The Veteran testified at a hearing before a VLJ in September 2023.  A transcript of the hearing has been associated with the claims file.  Under the rules of the AMA, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2022 rating decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran within 90 days following the hearing.  38C.F.R. §20.302(a)(3).  

In December 2023, the Board denied the claims of entitlement to service connection for dementia, OSA, PTSD, depression, anxiety, and TDIU.  The Veteran appealed the denial to the Court of Appeals of Veterans Claims (Court).  In January 2025, VA and the Veteran filed a joint motion for partial remand (JMPR), which was granted by the Court.  The Veteran did not challenge the Board's denial of the claims for PTSD and anxiety.  As such, the Court dismissed the appeal of these two issues.  See Pederson v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 276, 285 (2015) (en banc). The remaining matters now return to the Board for further consideration.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1131, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  Generally, service connection requires three elements: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.  Sheddon v. Principi, 381 F.3d. 1163, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence establishes that the disease was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

In deciding the Veteran's claim, the VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence supports the claim or is in relative equipoise, with the Veteran prevailing in either event; or whether the persuasive evidence is against the claim, in which case the claim is denied.  38 U.S.S. § 5107; Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53-56 (1990).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination, the benefit of the doubt is afforded the claimant.

1. Entitlement to service connection for depression. 

The Veteran contends he has a disability of depression that is related to service.

As to the first element required for service connection, the Veteran must show a current disability.

The Veteran's medical treatment records do not demonstrate any medical diagnosis of depression sufficient for VA compensation purposes.  Upon review of the Veteran's VA medical treatment records, there is a January 22, 2015 nursing triage note documenting a depression screening score of 2 and 0, respectively, which is a negative screen for depression.  See VBMS, document labeled CAPRI, receipt date 12/30/2022, page 578 of 581.  There is a November 13, 2015, neuropsychologist diagnosis of mild neurocognitive disorder.  See VBMS, document labeled CAPRI, receipt date 12/30/2022, page 491 of 581.  

In March 2019, the Veteran underwent a neuropsychology consult, at which time the Veteran noted feeling depressed and anxious.  Multiple tests were administered by a clinical neuropsychologist, to include the Geriatric Depression Scale.  The diagnostic impression was listed as Rule Out Neurocognitive Disorder.  A December 2020 neurology follow up confirmed the DSM-5 diagnosis of major vascular neurocognitive disorder. See VBMS, document labeled CAPRI, receipt date 12/30/2022, page 29 of 581.  

While Palo Alto treatment records on February 15, 2019 noted testing positive for geriatric anxiety was mild, and mild depression on November 7, 2016, there is a distinction between the Veteran's self-reports and an actual medical diagnosis; the latter of which the Veteran does not have.  To the extent that the Veteran may have received treatment for symptoms of depression, such diagnosis rendered for the purposes of treatment does not translate into a diagnosis of depression for which compensation may be granted.  38 C.F.R. § 4.125 (requiring mental disorder diagnoses to conform to the DSM-5).

The January 2025 JMPR specifically noted an internal medicine note from a VA treatment record on October 5, 2015, reflecting differential diagnosis of depression.  See VBMS, document labeled CAPRI, receipt date 12/19/2016, page 95 of 169.  However, there is a distinction between an assessment versus a differential diagnosis, which is a medical diagnosis.  The former does not equate the latter.  Rather, it reflects a medical process for attempting to distinguish between multiple possible conditions that may share similar signs or symptoms.  There is extensive examination of the Veteran's mental health since that note that clarifies the Veteran's DSM-5 diagnosis is major vascular neurocognitive disorder. 

In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim for service connection.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 226 (1992).  This principle has been repeatedly reaffirmed by the Federal Circuit, which has stated that "a Veteran seeking disability benefits must establish... the existence of a disability [and] a connection between the Veteran's service and the disability."  Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d. 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

The Board notes the Veteran's testimony at the September 2023 Board hearing that he was diagnosed in 2013 for depression.  However, a review of the Veteran's medical treatment records does not document such diagnosis.  

The Veteran has not been afforded an examination; however, the Board finds the duty to assist was not triggered in this case. As discussed above, there is no indication that the Veteran has a current DSM-5 disability apart from his neurocognitive disorder, or that his claimed disability is associated with his service.  Thus, a remand for a VA examination is not necessary.  Accordingly, the Board finds that the persuasive evidence is against the claim for service connection for depression.  As the evidence is not in relative equipoise, the benefit of the doubt rule does not apply.  38 U.S.C. §5107; 38 C.F.R. §3.102.  

2. Entitlement to service connection for dementia. 

The Veteran contends his dementia disability is due to his military service.

The December 2022 rating decision made a favorable finding that the Veteran is diagnosed with the disability of dementia, as the Palo Alto VAMC treatment records on July 30, 2019, confirm a diagnosis of dementia.  The Veteran's medical treatment records confirm this diagnosis during a neurology consultation.  See VBMS, document labeled CAPRI, receipt date 12/30/2022, page 248 of 581.  As such, the first element required for service connection has been met.  

While there is no dispute the Veteran has dementia, there is no evidence that such disability was manifested in service.  His service treatment records (STRs) are silent as to complaints, symptoms, or diagnosis of such disease.

The Board notes the Veteran's contention that he was exposed to water contamination in the water supply at Camp Lejeune during his military service and that he was exposed to herbicide agents when he was deployed to Okinawa and Iwakuni, Japan, which might have caused his dementia.

The Veteran's military personnel records document the was sent to Iwakuni, Japan.  See VBMS, document labeled Military Personnel Record, receipt date 5/15/2022, pages 33, 41, 43 of 95.  However, there are no entries in his military personnel records of being sent to Okinawa, Japan.  Regardless, Japan is not a location subject to presumptive service connection for exposure to herbicide agents under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309, nor the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), which was passed in August 2022.  The Veteran has not provided competent evidence of exposure to herbicides. Given the aforementioned evidence, there is no confirmed exposure to herbicide agents.

The Veteran's military personnel records also document he was stationed at Camp Lejeune from May 6, 1972 to September 8, 1972.  As such, the Veteran experienced TERA during military service.

Dementia is not a condition subject to presumptive service connection with exposure to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(f).  Additionally, dementia is also not a condition subject to presumptive service connection under the PACT Act.  

The January 2025 JMPR determined that the Board did not address whether there was a pre-decisional duty to provide a TERA examination for dementia.  However, a TERA examination is not required.  Specifically, dementia is a neurocognitive disorder under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, schedule of ratings for mental disorders.  Mental disorders included in 38 C.F.R. § 4.130 are included as part of the condition-based exceptions, which have been identified that there is no indication of an association between the disability claimed by a veteran and a TERA under 38 U.S.C. § 1168(b) per a June 12, 2024 Updated Guidance on Processing Claims Involving Public Law 117-168.  Given the aforementioned, a VA medical examination addressing whether the Veteran's dementia is due to TERA is not required.  

The Board recognizes the Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination in connection with his claim for service connection for dementia.  The duty to assist requires VA to provide a veteran with a medical examination or opinion when there is (1) competent evidence of a current disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of a disability, (2) evidence establishing that an event, injury, or disease occurred in service or establishing certain diseases manifesting during an applicable presumptive period for which the veteran qualifies, (3) an indication that the disability or persistent or recurrent symptoms of disability may be associated with the veteran's service or with another service-connected disability, and (4) insufficient competent evidence on file for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim.  See McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006).  

In this case, the Veteran's service connection claim for dementia contains negative evidence that such is related to service.  Although there is a confirmed diagnosed disability, there is no probative evidence of record to indicate that his current dementia may be associated with service or a service-connected disability.  Thus, the Board finds the duty to assist requirements per McLendon are not met in this case, there is no pre-decisional duty to assist error that must be corrected, and a remand for a VA examination is not necessary.

While the Veteran believes he was exposed to herbicide agents during service, he is not shown to be competent to identify that he was, as such requires particular expertise.  The Board also considered the Veteran and his wife's assertions as to the etiology of his dementia; however, as lay persons, they do not have the requisite training and experience necessary to address such a complex medical matter.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (noting general competence to testify as to symptoms but not to provide medical diagnosis). In this regard, the etiology of such disorder involves a medical subject concerning an internal physical process extending beyond an immediately observable cause-and-effect relationship. Therefore, such matter may not be competently addressed by lay statements. See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007).  

Therefore, the Board finds the elements required for service connection have not been met.  In reaching such decision, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.  However, the probative evidence persuasively weighs against the Veteran's claims for service connection for dementia.  As such, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal, and his claim must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Gilbert, 1 Vet. App. at 53.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to service connection for OSA.

The Veteran contends his OSA is due to military service.

The December 2022 rating decision made the favorable finding that Palo Alto VAMC treatment records confirm a diagnosis of sleep apnea on August 19, 2016.  The Veteran's VA medical treatment records confirm he is using CPAP therapy for treatment of OSA.  See VBMS, document labeled CAPRI receipt date 5/15/2019, page 96 of 204.  As such, the first element required for service connection has been met.

The Veteran's STRs do not contain complaints of, treatment for, or a diagnosis referable to OSA.  

As previously explained, the Board notes the Veteran's contention that he was exposed to water contamination in the water supply at Camp Lejeune during his military service and that he was exposed to herbicide agents when he was deployed to Okinawa and Iwakuni, Japan, which might have caused his OSA.

The Veteran's military personnel records document the was sent to Iwakuni, Japan, but there are no entries he was sent to Okinawa, Japan.  Again, Japan is not a location subject to presumptive service connection for exposure to herbicide agents under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309, nor the PACT Act.  The Veteran has not provided competent evidence of such exposure. As such, there is no confirmed exposure to herbicide agents.

However, the Veteran's military personnel records document he was stationed at Camp Lejeune from May 6, 1972 to September 8, 1972.  A veteran, or former reservist or member of the National Guard, who had no less than 30 days (consecutive or nonconsecutive) of service at Camp Lejeune during the period beginning on August 1, 1953, and ending on December 31, 1987, shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to the contaminants in the water supply, unless there is affirmative evidence to establish that the individual was not exposed to contaminants in the water supply during that service.  38 CFR 3.307(a)(7)(iii).  

OSA is not subject to presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(f), diseases associated with exposure to contaminants in the water supply at Camp Lejeune.  However, as previously explained, the law related to in-service TERA changed in August 2022, shortly prior to the issuance of the December 2022 rating decision.  Given the Veteran was stationed at Camp Lejeune during the requisite time, the Veteran experienced TERA during his military service.  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a) permits remand to satisfy any other statutory or regulatory duty.  As such, the Board finds remand of the current appeal for an examination and opinion would be appropriate to satisfy a statutory duty for the Veteran to be afforded a TERA examination.

2. Entitlement to a TDIU.

In September 2022, the Veteran submitted a claim for TDIU.  At the September 2023 Board hearing, the Veteran testified that his service-connected disabilities make him unable to work.

Total disability ratings for compensation based on individual unemployability may be assigned where the schedular rating is less than total, when it is found that the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of a single service-connected disability ratable at 60 percent or more, or as a result of two or more disabilities, provided at least one disability is ratable at 40 percent or more, and there is sufficient additional service-connected disabilities to bring the combined rating to 70 percent or more.  For the purpose of determining one 60 percent disability, disabilities resulting from a common etiology or a single accident are considered as one disability.  38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 416(a).  Currently, the Veteran meets the schedular criteria for a TDIU.

The degree to which the Veteran's ability to work may be impacted by his service-connected disabilities is unclear without the VA Form 21-8940 and information regarding his education, employment history, or earnings. Under 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (a), a claimant has the responsibility to present and support a claim for VA benefits. See Skoczen v. Shinseki, 564 F.3d 1319, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (the "support" requirement of section 5107(a) obligates the claimant to provide some evidentiary basis for his or her benefits claim). The Veteran was encouraged to complete and submit VA Form 8940 during the September 2023 Board hearing, but has not yet done so.

As this decision remands service connection for OSA, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) will need to conduct appropriate development for the matter and readjudicate TDIU accordingly.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1.	Obtain an opinion as to the nature and etiology of the Veteran's OSA. The entire claims file, including a copy of this Remand, must be made available to the examiner.  The examiner is requested to provide the following opinions:

a.	Whether it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's OSA had its onset during, or is otherwise the result of, his military service, to include his acknowledged participation in toxic exposure risk activities due to being stationed at Camp Lejeune and exposed to contaminated water from May 6, 1972 to September 8, 1972.

The examiner's attention is directed to the following:

See VBMS, document labeled Hearing Transcript, receipt date 9/1/2023, pages 4-7 of 26 (hearing testimony of the Veteran and his wife regarding OSA). 

The examiner is asked to explain the reasons behind any opinions expressed and conclusions reached. The examiner is reminded that the term "as likely as not" does not mean "within the realm of medical possibility," but rather that the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher. 

2.	Provide the Veteran with a VA Form 21-8940 with instructions that it should be completed in order to assist with the adjudication of his TDIU claim.  

*The Veteran is encouraged to cooperate with the AOJ's efforts to undertake development of his TDIU claim, to include the timely completion and submission of the VA Form 21-8940.

3.	Adjudicate the issue of entitlement to service connection for OSA after implementing the Board's decision herein and conducting any appropriate development of the issue of entitlement to a TDIU.
