FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The evidence is at least in equipoise that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction is proximately due to his service-connected hypertension and back disability.

2. The Veteran's erectile dysfunction causes loss of use of a creative organ.

3. The evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability manifested by chest pain, asthma, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, left carpal tunnel syndrome or right carpal tunnel syndrome at any time during or approximate to the pendency of the appeal period.  

4. The evidence persuasively weighs against finding that the Veteran's left knee disability, right knee disability, hypertrophy of prostate, and/or a disability manifested by frequent urination are etiologically related to a disease, injury, or event in service or that a disability manifested by frequent urination is related to a service-connected disability.

5. On July 16, 2021, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0966, Intent to File; his formal claims for service connection for pseudofolliculitis barbae, claimed as shaving profile, is postmarked August 23, 2021.  Prior to July 16, 2021, there were no formal claims, informal claims, or written intent to file claims for service connection for pseudofolliculitis barbae.

6. Throughout the appeal period, the evidence is persuasively against a finding that the Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae was manifested by characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12- month period.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from July 1979 to September 1994, to include service in Germany and Korea.  The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) thanks the Veteran for his many years of service to our country.

The rating decisions on appeal were issued in December 2021 and January 2022 and constitute initial decisions; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.  In this regard, it is noted that, in his March 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement (NOD)), the Veteran did not specify the January 2022 rating decision as a decision with which he disagreed. However, as the January 2022 rating decision is the only rating decision during the one year period prior to receipt of the NOD which adjudicated the claims of service connection for disabilities of the cervical spine, hips, ankles, feet (heel spurs and plantar fasciitis), GERD, and pseudofolliculitis barbae (the December 2021 rating decision deferred a decision as to these issues), the Board will consider the January 2022 rating decision as the decision on appeal as to these claims.  The remaining claims are on appeal from the December 2021 rating decision.  

In the March 2022 NOD, the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the December 2021 and January 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decisions on appeal as to the respective disorders addressed in each.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the respective AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

VA regulations require the Board to contact a claimant and request clarification if the Board cannot identify which review option a claimant intends to select.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(f).  Furthermore, a NOD may be unclear if a claimant who elects Direct Review includes evidence with the NOD, as under that review option evidence submitted along with an NOD may not be considered by the Board.  Edwards v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 56 (2023).  In this case, in September 2024, the Board sent the Veteran and his representative a letter advising that he submitted additional documents and/or statements with his NOD and that such evidence could not be considered by the Board unless he changed his docket review option and switched to either the Evidence Submission docket or the Hearing docket.  He was advised on how to make the docket switch and afforded an opportunity to do so, but, to date, the Board did not receive a response.  Thus, the Board will proceed to adjudicate the Veteran's claim under his original review option.  

As to the erectile dysfunction, chest pain, asthma, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, bilateral knee, hypertrophy of prostate, a disability manifested by frequent urination, and earlier effective date and increased rating for pseudofolliculitis barbae, if the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.  

However, because the Board is remanding the remaining service connection claims, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii).

Finally, the Board notes that in the October 2022 Appellate Brief, the Veteran's representative contends that VA did not make "the attempt under duty to assist for the Veteran to provide information or private medical records that can support his claims."  The Board notes, however, the Veteran submitted a signed Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits (VA Form 21-526EZ) in August 2021.  By signing the form, the Veteran certified that he had received the notice attached to this application titled "Notice to Veteran/Service Member of Evidence Necessary to Substantiate a Claim for Veterans Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits."  The Veteran also certified that he had enclosed all the information or evidence that will support his claim, to include an identification of relevant records available at a Federal facility such as a VA medical center; or that he had no information or evidence to give to VA to support his claim; or that he had checked the box in Item 1 indicating that he wanted his claim processed under the standard claim process because he planned to submit additional evidence in support of his claim.  The Board notes that the Veteran identified the standard claim process and listed the Birmingham Medical Center as the facility where he received treatment for his claimed disabilities after discharge.  VA treatment records from Birmingham Medical Center dated from June 2001, when the Veteran presented for "initiation of care," have been associated with the claims file.  The record does not show (and it is not claimed) that these records are incomplete.  The Veteran has not identified additional outstanding records to substantiate his claims.  The Board therefore finds that the Veteran certified that he had received proper notice regarding how to substantiate his claims and was given the opportunity to submit supporting evidence. Further, as noted above, the Veteran and his representative were notified in September 2024 of the process to request a docket switch, which, if approved, would afford him the opportunity to submit additional evidence (including private medical evidence to support his claims); however, no docket switch was thereafter requested. As such, the Board finds there is no pre-decisional error with respect to the duty to notify and remand for corrective action on this basis is not warranted.

Service Connection

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.  See 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).  Notwithstanding the lack of evidence of disease or injury during service, service connection may still be granted if all of the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service.  See 38 U.S.C. § 1113(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d); Cosman v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 503 (1992).  To establish a right to compensation for a present disability, the evidence must show: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.  Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2010).  The determination as to whether the requirements for service connection are met is based on an analysis of all the evidence of record and the evaluation of its credibility and probative value.  38 U.S.C. § 7104(a); Baldwin v. West, 13 Vet. App. 1 (1999); see 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).

Certain chronic diseases, including arthritis, will be presumed related to service if they were shown as chronic in service; or, if they manifested to a compensable degree within a presumptive period following separation from service (one year for arthritis); or, if they were noted in service, with continuity of symptomatology since service that is attributable to the chronic disease.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1112, 1113, 1137; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.307, 3.309. Walker v. Shinseki, 708 F.3d 1331, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

The Board is required to analyze the credibility and probative value of the evidence, account for any evidence that it finds persuasive or unpersuasive and provide the reasons for its rejection of any material evidence favorable to the claimant.  See Daye v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 512, 516 (2006).  It is noted that competency of evidence differs from weight and credibility.  The former is a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered by the trier of fact, while the latter is a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted.  Rucker v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 67, 74 (1997); Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469 (1994); see also Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991) ("although interest may affect the credibility of testimony, it does not affect competency to testify").  In determining whether statements are credible, the Board may consider internal consistency, facial plausibility, and consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the claimant.  Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).

A claimant bears the evidentiary burden to establish entitlement to the benefit sought.  See Fagan v. Shinseki, 573 F.3d 1282, 1287-88 (2009).  When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, the Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.  38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 53 (1990).  The benefit of the doubt applies when the evidence for and against is in "approximate balance" or "nearly equal," but does not apply when the evidence persuasively favors one side or the other.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

1. Service connection for erectile dysfunction is granted.

2. SMC for loss of use of a creative organ is granted.

The Veteran claims that his erectile dysfunction is secondary to his service-connected hypertension.  See August 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ.

Service connection may be established on a secondary basis for a disability that is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).  Establishing service connection on a secondary basis requires evidence sufficient to show (1) that a current disability exists and (2) that the current disability was either (a) caused by or (b) aggravated by a service-connected disability.  38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995) (en banc), reconciling, Leopoldo v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 216 (1993), and Tobin v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 34 (1991).

In the December 2021 rating decision, the AOJ made the favorable finding that VA treatment records show the Veteran's symptoms have been diagnosed as erectile dysfunction.  Such a favorable finding by the AOJ is binding on the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Notably, VA treatment records show the Veteran's Active Problems include "impotence of organic origin."  These records note a long history of erectile dysfunction.  See, e.g., September 2021 VA Urology Clinic Note.  Therefore, he has met the first, current disability, requirement of secondary service connection.  

Review of the record shows the Veteran has been service connected for hypertension effective from October 1, 1994, the day following his separation from service.  Therefore, he has met the second required element of secondary service connection by showing a separate disability already subject to service connection.  

The final element of secondary service connection generally requires medical evidence showing that the first disability is due to or the result of or aggravated by the already service-connected disability.  A VA hypertension examination report, completed in August 2004, prior to receipt of the Veteran's July 2021 Intent to File, notes the Veteran's problems include "impotence organic origin" and he had a history of "impaired sexual drive last five years."  The impression was that the Veteran "also has erectile dysfunction" and includes the opinion that "this is more than likely due to the blood pressure medication."  

Given the August 2004 medical opinion, the Board finds that the evidence persuasively weighs in favor of finding that the Veteran's erectile dysfunction is proximately due to his service-connected hypertension and, therefore, secondary service connection is warranted.  Accordingly, service connection for erectile dysfunction is granted.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; see Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (holding that only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

The Board also grants entitlement to SMC based on loss of use of a creative organ. As noted above, the Board is granting service connection for ED. SMC is payable at a specified rate if a veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, has loss of use of a creative organ. 38 U.S.C. § 1114(k); 38 C.F.R. § 3.350(a)(1).

3. Service connection for chest pain is denied. 

4. Service connection for chronic asthma is denied. 

5. Service connection for chronic allergic rhinitis is denied.

6. Service connection for chronic sinusitis is denied.

7. Service connection for left carpal tunnel syndrome is denied.

8. Service connection for right carpal tunnel syndrome is denied.

The Veteran contends that he has chest pain, chronic asthma, chronic allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis and bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome related to service. See August 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ, Veteran's Application for Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, and VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, which lists additional service connection claims.  Other than reporting intermittent tingling in the upper arm, forearm, and hands on October 2021 VA neck examination and symptoms of stuffy nose and congestion he thinks may be sinus headaches on October 2021 VA headaches examination; during the appeal period prior to the December 2021 rating decision on appeal which adjudicated these claims, the Veteran provided no evidence or argument as to whether he has been diagnosed with a disability manifested by the symptom of chest pain, how his claimed disabilities are related to service, or the associated symptoms he has experienced since service.

Congress has specifically limited entitlement to service connection for disease or injury to cases where such incidents have resulted in a current disability.  A "current disability" means a disability shown by competent medical evidence to exist.  Chelte v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 268 (1997).  With any claim for service connection, it is necessary for a current disability to be present.  See Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007) (recognizing the disability could arise at any time during the claim); Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289 (2013) (recognizing disabilities that occur immediately prior to filing of a claim).  The requirement that a current disability be present is satisfied "when the claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim even though the disability resolves prior to the Secretary's adjudication of the claim."  McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

Under applicable regulation, the term "disability" means impairment in earning capacity resulting from diseases and injuries and their residual conditions.  38 C.F.R. § 4.1; see Hunt v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 292, 296 (1991); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).  In Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2018), the Federal Circuit held that pain alone, in the absence of a diagnosed condition, may constitute a disability if it results in functional impairment of earning capacity.  While the Federal Circuit in Saunders only considered pain, the Court has held that Saunders is not limited to pain; rather, the definition of "disability" in 38 U.S.C. § 1110 includes any condition that results in "functional impairment of earning capacity."  Martinez-Bodon v. Wilkie, 32 Vet. App. 393, 398 (2020).

After review of the record, the Board finds that the Veteran does not have a diagnosed disability manifested by chest pain, asthma, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, or left or right carpal tunnel syndrome and has not had any of these claimed disabilities during the pendency of the claims or recent to the filing of the claims.  Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 294 (2013); McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).  

In reaching this conclusion, the Board has reviewed the Veteran's service treatment records, which show a September 1986 complaint of chest pain, chest X-ray and EKG (electrocardiogram) were normal and the assessment was "chest pain/chest wall pain."  A May 1987 treatment report notes a complaint of "pain [left] side of neck radiating to the chest - cold symptoms."  It is also noted the Veteran had a left axillary mass (cyst) with "spontaneous purulent drainage."  The assessment was bronchitis and abscess left axilla.  A July 1987 treatment report notes complaints of stuffy nose, congestion and sneezing assessed as bilateral rhinitis.  On April 1994 service separation examination, the Veteran's nose, sinuses, mouth and throat, lungs and chest, upper extremities, and neurologic system were clinically normal and he reported no history or complaints referrable to a disability manifested by chest pain, asthma, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, or left or right carpal tunnel syndrome.

Following service, in August 2021, the Veteran filed a claim for service connection for chest pain, chronic asthma, chronic allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis and bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.  He indicated having received treatment for his claimed disabilities at the Birmingham Medical Center.  The Veteran's treatment records from this facility, dated from June 2001 to December 2021, are silent as to complaints of or treatment for chest pain (to include a disability manifested by chest pain), asthma, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis or bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome at any time during or proximate to receipt of his August 2021 claim.  He has not reported having received treatment at any other facility and provided no additional evidence or argument in support of his claims during the appeal period prior to the December 2021 rating decision on appeal.  

The December 2021 rating decision on appeal made no favorable findings as to the claims of service connection for a disability manifested by chest pain, asthma, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, or left or right carpal tunnel syndrome.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

Upon review of the evidence, the Board finds that service connection for a disability manifested by chest pain, asthma, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, and left or right carpal tunnel syndrome is not warranted.  In this regard, the Board is cognizant that the Veteran is competent to report on the existence of factual matters of which he has firsthand knowledge, such as symptoms (pain, breathing difficulty, tingling) or events he has experienced and/or continues to experience.  See Washington v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 191, 195 (2007) (holding that, "[a]s a layperson, the appellant is competent to provide information regarding visible, or otherwise observable, symptoms of disability").  However, the evidence does not show and, during the appeal period prior to the December 2021 rating decision on appeal, the Veteran did not report that he has experienced symptoms and/or impairment referrable to his claimed chest pain, asthma, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, or left and/or right carpal tunnel syndrome after his separation from service.

In this case, the record contains no evidence or argument during the appeal period prior to the December 2021 claim on appeal that the Veteran has a disability manifested chest pain, asthma, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, or left and/or right carpal tunnel syndrome that result in functional impairment of earning capacity.  Without some indication that the claimed disabilities cause symptomatology that results in functional impairment, the Board cannot conclude that the Veteran currently experiences (or has experienced at any time during or proximate to the appeal period) a disability manifested chest pain, asthma, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, or left and/or right carpal tunnel syndrome for VA compensation purposes.  Thus, there is simply no competent, probative evidence of a current disability upon which to predicate an award of service connection.  See Saunders, supra, and Martinez-Bodon, supra. 

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran believes service connection for a disability manifested chest pain, asthma, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, and left and right carpal tunnel syndrome is warranted.  However, to the extent he believes he currently has these disabilities or that any symptoms he experiences are related to his military service, as a layperson he is not competent to opine as to diagnoses or causation, these are complex medical questions and specialized medical training and expertise is required.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

Although it is noted that the Veteran has not been afforded VA examinations in connection with his claimed chest pain, asthma, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, and carpal tunnel syndrome disabilities, the Board finds no pre-decisional duty to assist error in this regard.  The evidence of record at the time of the December 2021 rating decision did not include competent evidence indicating that the Veteran had a disability manifested by chest pain, asthma, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, or carpal tunnel syndrome which may be associated with military service.  38 U.S.C. § 5103A(d); McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79, 81 (2006).  The only evidence suggesting a current disability or signs and symptoms of a disability is related to service are the notations in his August 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ, Veteran's Application for Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, and VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, which lists additional service connection claims.  This is insufficient to trigger the duty to assist to get a VA examination.  Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278-79 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (holding that a claimant's "conclusory generalized statement that his service illness caused his present medical problems" was not sufficient to entitle him to a VA examination).

In light of the above, the Board finds that service connection for a disability manifested by chest pain, asthma, allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, and left and right carpal tunnel syndrome must be denied.  In reaching the conclusion to deny these claims, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.  However, as the evidence persuasively weighs against a finding that the Veteran currently has the claimed disabilities, that doctrine is not applicable.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

9. Service connection for a left knee disability is denied.  

10. Service connection for a right knee disability is denied. 

11. Service connection for hypertrophy of prostate is denied.

12. Service connection for a disability manifested by frequent urination is denied. 

The Veteran seeks service connection for a disability of both knees, hypertrophy of prostate and a disability manifested by frequent urination; however, during the appeal period prior to the December 2021 rating decision on appeal, apart from filing a claim, the Veteran has not offered any contentions as to how he believes these disabilities are related to his military service or how a disability manifested by frequent urination is related to his service connected hypertension.  See August 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ, Veteran's Application for Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, and VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, which lists additional service connection claims.  

With regard to the first element of service connection, in the December 2021 rating decision, the AOJ made the favorable finding that VA treatment records show the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability because VA treatment record show diagnosis of bilateral patella femoral dysfunction, hypertrophy (benign) of enlarged prostate without urinary obstruction, and urinary incontinence.  Such favorable findings by the AOJ are binding on the Board.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  

Specifically, VA treatment records include a June 2001 primary care outpatient note which shows a finding of bilateral knee patella-femoral dysfunction.  It is noted the Veteran reported a history of "problems with his knees in the past, and has used braces."  These records show continued findings of bilateral knee patella-femoral syndrome in June 2021, 2 months prior to receipt of his August 2021 claim for service connection.  These records also include complaints of slow urinary stream initially noted in July 2006, nocturia initially noted in March 2010, and incontinence initially noted in January 2016.  An April 2014 report of urology consultation notes the Veteran reported noticing urinary symptoms 2 years previously "with no associating factors."  These records show findings of enlarged prostate in July 2006 and "hypertrophy (benign) of prostate without urinary obstruction" in March 2010.  VA treatment records dated in September 2021, during the appeal period, noted hypertrophy of prostate on the Veteran's problem list and show continued complaints of "weak stream and nocturia 3 [times]/night."  

Thus, it is not in dispute that the Veteran has diagnoses of a left and right knee disability and hypertrophy of prostate as well as complaints of urinary impairment (diagnosed nocturia and incontinence) proximate to the appeal period.  As such, the first requirement for service connection, a current disability, as to these claims has been met.

However, the second (inservice event) and third (nexus) elements are not met as to the left knee, right knee and hypertrophy of prostate service connection claims and, although the Veteran was treated for urinary complaints during service and he is service connected for hypertension, the third (nexus) element is not met as to the claim for a disability manifested by urinary frequency.  

The Veteran's service treatment records are silent as to complaints of or treatment for impairment left and/or right knee impairment (although the Veteran's September 1969 Report of Medical History of enlistment shows he reported a history of a left leg fracture and undergoing open reduction in 1969 at age 13 and his service treatment records show treatment for left leg and tibia pain during service) or prostate symptoms.  Although the Veteran's service treatment records show he sought treatment for a history of "nocturnal enuresis once a week" in February 1978 and symptoms of "dull pain" with urination in February 1980, when he was treated for a bladder infection, his genito-urinary system was clinically normal and he reported no history of frequent or painful urination on April 1994 service retirement examination.  During the appeal period prior to the December 2021 rating decision, the Veteran provided no argument or evidence as to how his claimed left knee disability, right knee disability, hypertrophy of prostate and/or a disability manifested by urinary frequency were related to or caused by an incident or injury in service.  

The record does not show the Veteran's claimed left knee disability, right knee disability and/or hypertrophy of prostate manifested in service and, although the Veteran was treated for urinary complaints in service, the evidence persuasively shows that many years passed after his report of urinary issues in service before he again reported urinary issues. He specifically denied urinary issues at service separation and at his initial post-service treatment for this issue in April 2014, he reported noticing urinary symptoms 2 years previously "with no associating factors."   As the initial post-service onset of these disabilities is years after service separation and the Veteran has not claimed otherwise during the appeal period prior to the December 2021 rating decision on appeal, there is no indication of a connection between these disorders and service. As such no predecisional error occurred with respect to development for examination and/or medical opinion.

There is no evidence in the claims file indicating that any of the Veteran's healthcare providers found a relationship between his claimed knee disabilities, hypertrophy of prostate and/or a disability manifested by urinary frequency and his active service.  

Although the Veteran claims that his left and right knee disabilities, hypertrophy of prostate and urinary frequency are disabilities related to his military service and that his urinary frequency is secondary to his service-connected hypertension, as a layperson, he lacks the medical knowledge and training to offer probative opinions as to these claims.  The etiology of these disabilities is a medical question beyond the scope of lay observation; it requires medical expertise.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  The Veteran lacks such expertise and has not submitted any medical opinion or medical literature in support of his claims.

In summary, the medical evidence shows that the Veteran has a right knee disability, hypertrophy of prostate, and a disability manifested by urinary frequency (nocturia and incontinence), that became manifest many years after his separation from service.  However, there is no competent evidence that shows or suggests these disabilities may be etiologically related to his service or that his urinary frequency is caused or aggravated by his service-connected hypertension.  Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claims for service connection for a right knee disability, hypertrophy of prostate and/or a disability manifested by urinary frequency; the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not for application and these claims must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

Effective Date

Generally, the effective date of an award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase is either the day following separation from active service or the date entitlement arose if the claim is received within one year after separation from service; otherwise, it will be the date of receipt of the claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later.  38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b).

"Claim" is defined broadly to include a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement or evidencing a belief in entitlement to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p); Brannon v. West, 12 Vet. App. 32, 34-35 (1998).  A rating decision adjudicating a claim for benefits will become final if a claimant does not perfect an appeal by filing a notice of disagreement within one year from the date that the RO mailed the notice of the determination.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.302, 20.1103.

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that a claim for benefits be submitted on a standardized form.  79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014) (eff. Mar. 24, 2015).

Under the law as in effect prior to March 24, 2015, a claim was defined as a formal or informal communication in writing requesting a determination of entitlement, or evidencing a belief in entitlement, to a benefit.  38 C.F.R. § 3.1(p) (2014) (amended 2015).  An informal claim was any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits that identified the benefit sought.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a) (2014) (repealed 2015).  Under the law at the time, VA had an obligation to look to all communications from a claimant that may be interpreted as applications or claims formal and informal for benefits and was required to identify and act on informal claims for benefits.  Servello v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 196, 198 (1992).  To qualify as an informal claim, a document must evince an intent to apply for benefits and identify the benefits sought.  See Shea v. Wilke, 926 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2019); Sellers v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 157, 162 (2018); Brokowski v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 79, 84 (2009).

As of March 24, 2015, VA no longer recognizes informal claims.  As of such date, a claimant, or certain other individuals as specified in section 3.155(b), may indicate a claimant's intent to file a claim for benefits by submitting an intent to file a claim to VA.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  An intent to file a claim must provide sufficient identifiable or biographical information to identify the claimant.  Upon receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will furnish the claimant with the appropriate application form prescribed by the Secretary.  If VA receives a complete application form prescribed by the Secretary, as defined in 38 C.F.R. § 3.160(a), appropriate to the benefit sought within one year of receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will consider the complete claim filed as of the date of the intent to file a claim was received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).

If an intent to file a claim is not submitted in the form required by 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(1), as described above, or a complete claim is not filed within one year of the receipt of the intent to file a claim, VA will not take further action unless a new claim or a new intent to file a claim is received.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(4).

VA will not recognize more than one intent to file concurrently for the same benefit (e.g., compensation, pension).  If an intent to file has not been followed by a complete claim, a subsequent intent to file regarding the same benefit received within one year of the prior intent to file will have no effect.  If, however, VA receives an intent to file followed by a complete claim and later another intent to file for the same benefit is submitted within one year of the previous intent to file, VA will recognize the subsequent intent to file to establish an effective date for any award granted for the next complete claim, provided it is received within 1 year of the subsequent intent to file.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(6).

The "intent to file" is a term of art defined by VA regulation, which can only be submitted in certain formats.  Specifically, an intent to file a claim can be submitted in one of the following three ways: (i) a saved electronic application (as specified in section 3.155(b)(1)(i)); (ii) a written intent on prescribed intent to file a claim form (the submission to an AOJ of a signed and dated intent to file a claim, on the form prescribed by the Secretary for that purpose, will be accepted as an intent to file a claim); or (iii) oral intent communicated to a designated VA personnel and recorded in writing, as further specified in 38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b)(1)(iii).

1. Entitlement to an effective date earlier than July 16, 2021 for the award of service connection for pseudofolliculitis barbae is denied.

The record shows that the Veteran filed VA Form 21-0966 (Intent to File) on July 16, 2021.  On July 19, 2021, the Veteran was notified that the VA received an intent to file on July 16, 2021, and that if his completed application was received within one year from the date that his intent to file was received, he may be able to be compensated from the date they received his intent to file.

Thereafter, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, and a VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, postmarked on August 23, 2021, which listed the disabilities, including pseudofolliculitis barbae (claimed as shaving profile), for which he sought service connection.  

The Veteran has not claimed, and the evidence does not reflect, that he filed a claim for service connection for pseudofolliculitis barbae (or shaving profile) prior to August 2021.  Further, the Board finds that the VA Form 21-526EZ filed in August 2021, was the only claim received within one year of the July 16, 2021, intent to file a claim.

The Board acknowledges that the Veteran may have experienced symptoms related to his pseudofolliculitis barbae prior to July 16, 2021.  However, the Board finds that the evidence shows the claim for service connection for shaving profile pseudofolliculitis barbae was received (postmarked) on August 23, 2021, within one year of the intent to file that was submitted on July 16, 2021.

Accordingly, the Veteran's July 2021 intent to file a claim is the later date between the date of receipt of the claim and the date entitlement arose.  As such, the proper effective date for the grant of service connection for the Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae is July 16, 2021.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by applying the criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities.  The percentage ratings are based on the average impairment of earning capacity and individual disabilities are assigned separate diagnostic codes.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.

In order to evaluate the level of disability and any changes in condition, it is necessary to consider the complete medical history of the Veteran's condition.  Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589, 594 (1991).  Staged ratings are appropriate for any rating claim when the factual findings show distinct time periods during the appeal period where the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings.  Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007); Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999).  Where the question is the propriety of the initial evaluation assigned, consideration of the medical evidence since the effective date of the award of service connection is required.  Fenderson, at 126.  Where the question is the propriety of a non-initial evaluation, consideration of the evidence up to one year prior to the filing of the claim is appropriate.  See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

In McGrath v. Gober, 14 Vet. App. 28 (2000), the Court held that when evidence is created is irrelevant compared to when the Veteran was actually experiencing the symptoms.  Thus, the Board will consider whether the evidence suggests that the severity of the Veteran's symptoms increased sometime prior to the date of the examination reports.

The Board notes that in every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable rating for pseudofolliculitis barbae is denied.  

The Veteran is seeking a compensable rating for pseudofolliculitis barbae.  During the January 2022 VA examination, the Veteran reported he "dealt with pseudofolliculitis barbae since his active duty years."  The examiner noted that the Veteran "currently wears a neat, short beard in order to not shave daily and uses clippers and no razors to trim his beard/shave his neck."  

As noted above, the Veteran's claim for service connection for shaving profile, accepted as a claim for pseudofolliculitis barbae, was received by VA in August 2021, within one year of an intent to file claim, received by VA on July 16, 2021.  The January 2022 rating decision, which granted service connection and assigned a zero percent rating for shaving profile pseudofolliculitis barbae, effective July 16, 2021, was issued on January 28, 2022.  Thus, the period for consideration is from July 16, 2021, to January 28, 2022, the date the January 2022 rating decision was issued.  As this pseudofolliculitis barbae appeal pertains to an initial rating assigned with a grant of service connection, the one year look back period does not apply.  

The January 2022 rating decision also granted service connection for hyperpigmented skin on neck, residuals of pseudofolliculitis barbae, separately rated as zero percent disabling under Code 7800, based on scar of the head, face, or neck with no compensable symptoms.  The January 2022 VA scars examination report notes stable anterior neck scars where beard grows caused by pseudofolliculitis barbae.  The scars were not painful or unstable.  The examiner described the scar as causing disfigurement at the anterior neck, where beard grows, and indicated measurements were "N/A" (not applicable).  The abnormal pigmentation was described as hyperpigmentation and the approximate combined total area affected was 40 centimeters squared which caused no limitation of function or other conditions.  See, also, January 2022 VA skin conditions examination report.  The Veteran did not express disagreement with this determination in his March 2022 Notice of Disagreement.  Seeing as the Veteran is separately rated for hyperpigmented skin on neck, residuals of pseudofolliculitis barbae, the Board construes the issue on appeal to be limited to the non-compensable rating assigned under Code 7813 for pseudofolliculitis barbae and does not include the zero percent rating assigned under Code 7800 for scars related to pseudofolliculitis barbae.

The Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae is rated under Code 7813 for dermatophytosis (ringworm: Of body, tinea corporis; of head, tinea capitis; of feet, tinea pedis; of beard area, tinea barbae; of nails, tinea unguium (onychomycosis); of inguinal area (jock itch), tinea cruris; tinea versicolor).  Code 7813 directs that dermatophytosis be evaluated under the General Rating Formula for the Skin, which applies to Codes 7806, 7809, 7813 to 7816, 7820 to 7822, and 7824.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118.  The General Rating Formula for the Skin provides that a noncompensable rating is assigned for no more than topical therapy required over the past 12-month period and at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of the entire body affected; or characteristic lesions involving less than 5 percent of exposed areas affected.  A 10 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, psoralen with long-wave ultraviolet-A light (PUVA), or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.  A 30 percent rating is assigned at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 20 to 40 percent of the entire body or 20 to 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of 6 weeks or more, but not constantly, over the past 12-month period.  A 60 percent rating is assigned for at least one of the following: characteristic lesions involving more than 40 percent of the entire body, or more than 40 percent of exposed areas affected; or constant or near-constant systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required over the past 12-month period.  Or the disability is to be rated as disfigurement of the head, face, or neck (Code 7800) or scars (Codes 7801, 7802, 7803, 7804, or 7805), depending on the predominant disability.  38 C.F.R. § 4.118, General Rating Formula for the Skin.

As it pertains to Codes 7806, 7809, 7813 to 7816, 7820 to 7822, and 7824, 38 C.F.R. § 4.118(a) explicitly states that "systemic therapy is treatment that is administered through any route other than the skin, and topical therapy is treatment that is administered through the skin."

The evidence persuasively weighs against the assignment of a compensable evaluation.  The Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae does not more nearly approximate (1) characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or (2) at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or (3) intermittent systemic therapy required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12- month period.

A January 2022 VA skin conditions examination report notes pseudofolliculitis barbae described as "hyperpigmented areas of skin observed on his neck, no acne/pustules or ice-pick scarring seen" located on the Veteran's anterior neck, where his beard grows.  The examiner noted pseudofolliculitis barbae covered less than 5 percent of the total body area and less than 5 percent of total exposed area.  It is also noted that the Veteran had not been treated with medications in the past 12 months for any skin condition.  These findings do not more nearly approximate the disability level for a compensable rating under Code 7813.

The Veteran's VA treatment records, dated from June 2001 to December 2021, do not document treatment for pseudofolliculitis barbae, to include during the period on appeal which begins with the Veteran's July 16, 2021, intent to file.  

Further, the Veteran, as a layperson, is competent to report the symptoms he has experienced; however, he has not been shown to have the requisite knowledge or training to be deemed competent to identify a specific level of disability for his pseudofolliculitis barbae according to the rating criteria.  Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Such competent evidence concerning the nature and extent of the Veteran's pseudofolliculitis barbae has been provided by the clinician who completed the January 2022 VA skin conditions and scars examination reports.  The findings reported in these examination reports are provided by an examiner competent to conduct the examinations, they are objective and probative evidence, and are accorded greater weight than the Veteran's subjective reports of symptomatology associated with his pseudofolliculitis barbae.  Moreover, the Veteran does not assert his pseudofolliculitis barbae more nearly approximated the criteria for a compensable rating, specifically resulting characteristic lesions involving at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of the entire body affected; or at least 5 percent, but less than 20 percent, of exposed areas affected; or intermittent systemic therapy including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, phototherapy, retinoids, biologics, photochemotherapy, PUVA, or other immunosuppressive drugs required for a total duration of less than 6 weeks over the past 12-month period.

Consideration has been given as whether any other Codes related to disabilities of the skin would provide for a higher disability evaluation.  As noted above, scars related to pseudofolliculitis barbae are already separately rated under Code 7800.  The evidence does not reflect that the pseudofolliculitis barbae would warrant a higher rating under a different diagnostic code for which a rating has not already been assigned.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.118.

Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues, nor have any other issues been reasonably raised by the record with his respect to his pseudofolliculitis barbae. See Doucette v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 366 (2017) (confirming that the Board is not required to address issues unless they are specifically raised by the claimant or reasonably raised by the evidence of record).

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claims for an increased initial rating for pseudofolliculitis barbae; the benefit-of-the-doubt rule is not for application and the claims must be denied.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4 th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021).

REASONS FOR REMAND

Under the AMA, remands are limited to pre-decisional duty to assist errors and "correction of any other error by the agency of original jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim."  38 C.F.R. § 20.802(a).  Here, for the reasons discussed below, the Board must remand the remaining service connection claims on appeal to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the December 2021 and January 2022 rating decisions on appeal.  

1. Service connection for a cervical spine disability is remanded.  

2. Service connection for a left hip disability is remanded.  

3. Service connection for a right hip disability is remanded.  

4. Service connection for left ankle disability is remanded.  

5. Service connection for right ankle disability is remanded.  

6. Service connection for a foot disability, including bilateral plantar fasciitis and heel spurs, is remanded.  

The January 2022 rating decision on appeal made favorable findings that (1) the evidence shows that a qualifying event, injury, or disease had its onset during the Veteran's service.  His service treatment records reflect a complaint of neck, hip, ankle and foot pain; (2) He had been diagnosed with a disability.  The October 2021 VA examinations diagnosed cervical spine conditions, to include intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) and cervical enthesopathy; bilateral hip and left ankle degenerative arthritis, other than post-traumatic; right ankle lateral collateral ligament sprain; bilateral heel spurs and plantar fasciitis; and (3) VA treatment records reflect treatment for cervical spine conditions, including IVDS and cervical enthesopathy, hip pain, heel spurs and plantar fasciitis.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).

The Veteran underwent VA neck, hip, ankle, and foot conditions examinations in October 2021.  These examination reports show that the Veteran recalled he had neck, hip, ankle and foot pain (due to plantar fasciitis and heel spurs) during service and these symptoms have continued to the present.  He attributed his neck pain, which has progressively worsened, to "jobs" and a "head injury in 1978" caused by a wall locker shelf which fell and him on the head and his hip and ankle pain to running.  

The January 2022 opinions obtained in connection with these examination reports provide that the Veteran's cervical spine, bilateral hip, bilateral ankle, plantar fasciitis, heel spurs were less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service injury, event or illness as there "is no evidence of continuity of care" for these disabilities during and after his military service.  

The Board notes that absence of documented treatment in service or thereafter is not fatal to a service connection claim, and the absence of evidence in the service treatment records is an insufficient basis, by itself, for a negative opinion.  See Ledford v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 87, 89 (1992).  

As the clinician providing the January 2022 opinions relied solely on an absence of continuity of care without any further findings, these opinions are insufficient for rating purposes.  The failure to obtain adequate opinions addressing these claims is a pre-decisional error requiring remand to obtain supplemental opinions addressing the claims on a direct incurrence basis, with consideration of the Veteran's multiple service treatment records documenting his neck, hip, ankle and foot pain.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2011).

7. Service connection for left shoulder disability is remanded.  

8. Service connection for right shoulder disability is remanded.  

The December 2021 rating decision on appeal made the favorable finding that the Veteran has been diagnosed with a disability because VA treatment records show a diagnosis of left shoulder pain.  The Board is bound by these favorable findings.  38 C.F.R. § 3.104(c).  Regarding a right shoulder disability, VA treatment records include a November 2020 report of anesthesiology consultation which notes the Veteran sought treatment for neck pain that radiates into bilateral upper extremities.  In addition, the October 2021 VA neck conditions examination report notes the Veteran's neck pain causes "radicular symptoms to the shoulders and arms, left greater than right."  

The Veteran's service treatment records include a July 1989 report of treatment for pain located in the cervical spine and upper trapezius area.  He complained of discomfort around the base of the neck, between his shoulder blades and under arm. 

The Veteran has not been afforded a VA examination in connection with his claimed shoulder disabilities.  However, based on the foregoing evidence, the Board finds that the low threshold for meeting VA's duty to assist in providing an examination has been triggered.  McLendon v. Nicholson, 20 Vet. App. 79 (2006).

9. Service connection for a gastrointestinal disability, claimed as GERD and acid reflux, is remanded.  

The Veteran underwent VA esophageal conditions examination in October 2021 and in a corresponding January 2022 medical nexus opinion, the clinician opined that GERD is less likely than not incurred in or caused by his military service because the "Veteran's retirement/separation exam was silent for GERD and there is no evidence in veteran's medical records regarding treatment or diagnosis of GERD during his military service."  However, review of the Veteran's service treatment records show a July 1989 notation of "possible esophageal reflux" and an April 1992 assessment of reflux esophagitis.  As such, the January 2022 medical opinion is based on an inaccurate factual premise.  Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 460-61 (1993).

The failure to obtain an adequate opinion addressing this claim is a pre-decisional duty to assist error requiring remand to obtain a supplemental opinion addressing the claim on a direct incurrence basis, with consideration of the Veteran's service treatment records noting esophageal reflux and reflux esophagitis.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2011).

10. Service connection for an eye disability, claimed as blurred vision, is remanded.  

11. Service connection for headaches is remanded.  

12. Service connection for sleep disturbances is remanded.  

13. Service connection for insomnia is remanded.  

14. Service connection for sleep apnea is remanded.  

The Veteran claims service connection for blurred vision, headaches, and sleep disturbance secondary to hypertension.  He also claims service connection for insomnia and sleep apnea.  See August 2021 VA Form 21-526EZ, Veteran's Application for Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits, and VA Form 21-4138, Statement in Support of Claim, which lists additional service connection claims.  

The Veteran underwent VA headache, mental disorders, and sleep apnea examinations in October 2021 and eye conditions examination in December 2021 with corresponding medical nexus opinions were obtained.  

The headache examination report provides a diagnosis of "headache" but does not specify the type of headache.  In the corresponding opinion, the examiner opined that the Veteran's headaches disability is less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the his service connected hypertension because his "claims file does not support the contention that his headaches, for which he has no diagnosis in his medical records, are caused by his hypertension which seems to be reported as controlled in his medical record, and he is only on one blood pressure medication.  I did not find anything about hypertension causing headaches in this Veteran's claims file, and this Veteran did not mention headaches during the exam as a cause of his headaches.  In my opinion it is less likely than not that this Veteran has a headache condition that is caused by hypertension."  

The sleep apnea examination report shows the Veteran does not have and has never been diagnosed with sleep apnea.  Notably, the examiner referred to a May 1992 sleep study, completed 19 years earlier during the Veteran's active duty service and available for review in his service treatment records, which found no diagnosis of sleep apnea.  The record also includes an October 2021 report of VA mental disorders examination which shows the symptoms associated with his diagnosis of adjustment disorder with depressed mood includes chronic sleep impairment.  In the remarks section, the clinician commented the Veteran "stated that he has trouble both going to sleep and staying asleep.  He sleeps an average of three hours a night with interruption.  [The Veteran] stated that his pain, sleep apnea, and need to urinate frequently disrupt his sleep.  He sometimes nods off during the day.  [The Veteran] has been having trouble sleeping since the 1990's."  In an October 2021 opinion, the clinician opined that the Veteran's sleep disturbance is less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the his service connected hypertension.  The examiner explained that the Veteran "told the examiner and has told his treatment psychologist that he is not sleeping well.  He says that his sleep disturbance is long standing.  [The Veteran] stated that pain, breathing trouble and a frequent need to urinate are the reasons he is not able to sleep well.  Since sleep apnea and lower back pain are more likely causes of [the Veteran'] sleep disturbance than his hypertension it is less likely than not that his sleep disturbance is proximately due to [the Veteran's] hypertension."  Notably, the Veteran is service connected for a back disability, characterized as intervertebral disc syndrome with degenerative arthritis.  

The eye conditions examination report provides no diagnosis of an eye disability; however, it is noted the Veteran has diplopia of unknown etiology.  In the corresponding opinion, the examiner opined that the Veteran's blurred vision is less likely than not proximately due to or the result of the Veteran's service connected condition because it "Doesn't fit symptoms."  The clinician provided no opinion as to as to aggravation or the nature and etiology of the Veteran's diplopia.  

Although the medical nexus opinions address secondary service connection for the Veteran's headache, sleep disturbance and eye disability claims, the clinician failed to address aggravation of these disabilities under 38 C.F.R. § 3.310(b).  A secondary service connection opinion that fails to address aggravation is inadequate on its face.  El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 141 (2013).  Thus, the AOJ's failure to obtain adequate opinions addressing these claims is a pre-decisional error and remand is required.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 309 (2011).

In addition, the Board finds that the evidence of record at the time of the December 2021 rating decision under review was sufficient to trigger VA's duty to assist in obtaining VA opinions addressing whether the Veteran's headache disability and sleep disturbance, to include insomnia and sleep apnea, are related to service on a direct incurrence basis.  Specifically, the Veteran's service treatment records show he sought treatment for a head injury after a shelf fell on his head in March 1979, complained of headaches once a day in October 1979 and, during October 2021 headaches examination, he reported a history of having recurring headaches after a shelf fall on his during service.  The Veteran's service treatment records also include a March 1992 note that he reported he snores and his "wife tells him he stops breathing for several seconds."  He underwent sleep study in April 1992 and a May 1992 polysomnography report shows a finding of "no supportive evidence for sleep apnea syndrome."  As noted on his VA mental disorders examination report, the Veteran has reported "having trouble sleeping since the 1990's;" thus, during his active duty service.  His VA treatment records show he has continued to complain of sleep impairment and a November 2021 VA treatment report notes the Veteran was scheduled to undergo a sleep study to rule out sleep apnea.  As such, the record shows the Veteran may have a headache disability and/or sleep impairment directly related to service; however, medical nexus opinions as to direct service connection for these disabilities have not been obtained.  The AOJ's failure to obtain opinions addressing direct service connection as to these claims is a pre-decisional error that must be corrected on remand.  Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 303, 311-12 (2007).  

At this time, the Board intimates no opinion as to the credibility of any lay statements and defers any credibility determinations until final adjudication of the Veteran's claims.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain medical opinions from an appropriate clinician addressing the nature and etiology of the Veteran's cervical spine, left hip, right hip, left ankle, right ankle, and foot disabilities.  The clinician is asked to provide a response to the following:

(a) Does the Veteran have a cervical spine disability, including intervertebral disc syndrome (IVDS) and cervical enthesopathy, which is at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to service, with consideration of the Veteran's service treatment record documenting neck pain?

(b) Does the Veteran have a left and/or right hip disability, including bilateral hip degenerative arthritis, other than post-traumatic, which is at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to service, with consideration service treatment record show recurrent right hip pain, February 1992 assessment of muscle strain and March 1992 bone study for "cyst in pelvis"?  

(c) Does the Veteran have a left and/or right ankle disability, including left ankle degenerative arthritis, other than post-traumatic, and right ankle lateral collateral ligament sprain which is at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to service, with consideration of treatment for left ankle complaints in August and November 1988?

(d) Does the Veteran have a left and/or right foot disability, including bilateral heel spurs and/or plantar fasciitis, which is at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to service, with consideration of complaints of right foot pain in February 1986 and left foot pain in November 1988?

The examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms/history and that such reports must be acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinion.  If his reports are discounted, the examiner should provide a reason for doing so.

A full rationale is to be provided for all stated medical opinions.  If an opinion cannot be made without resort to speculation, the examiner should provide an explanation as to why this is so and note what, if any, additional evidence would permit such an opinion to be made.

2. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the nature and etiology of any bilateral shoulder disability.  The clinician is asked to provide a response to the following:

(a) Does the Veteran have a left and/or right shoulder disability, to include pain resulting in functional loss, which is at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to service, with consideration of his service treatment records documenting complaints of discomfort around the base of the neck, between his shoulder blades and under arm?

The examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms/history and that such reports must be acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinion.  If his reports are discounted, the examiner should provide a reason for doing so.

A full rationale is to be provided for all stated medical opinions.  If an opinion cannot be made without resort to speculation, the examiner should provide an explanation as to why this is so and note what, if any, additional evidence would permit such an opinion to be made.

3. Obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate clinician addressing the nature and etiology of the Veteran's gastrointestinal disability, claimed as GERD and acid reflux.  The clinician is asked to provide a response to the following:

Does the Veteran have a gastrointestinal disability, to include GERD and/or acid reflux, which is at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to service, with consideration of his service treatment records documenting a July 1989 notation of "possible esophageal reflux" and an April 1992 assessment of reflux esophagitis?

The examiner is advised that the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms/history and that such reports must be acknowledged and considered in formulating any opinion.  If his reports are discounted, the examiner should provide a reason for doing so.

A full rationale is to be provided for all stated medical opinions.  If an opinion cannot be made without resort to speculation, the examiner should provide an explanation as to why this is so and note what, if any, additional evidence would permit such an opinion to be made.

4. Obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate clinician addressing the nature and etiology of the Veteran's eye disability, headaches, sleep disturbances, insomnia and sleep apnea.  The clinician is asked to provide a response to the following:

Eye Disability

(a) Is it at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran has an eye disability, including diplopia, that is proximately due to or the result of his service connected disabilities, to include hypertension?  The clinician is advised that the service-connected disability need not be the sole cause of the claimed disability; and

(c) Is it at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran has an eye disability, including diplopia, that is aggravated (any increase in disability) by his service-connected disabilities, to include hypertension?  If aggravation is found, the clinician must identify a baseline (the level of eye disability prior to the aggravation).

Headache Disability

(a) Does the Veteran have a headache disability which is at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) related to service, with consideration of his service treatment records documenting treatment for a head injury after a shelf fell on his head in March 1979 and complaints of headaches once a day in October 1979?

(b) Is it at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's headache disability is proximately due to or the result of service-connected disabilities, to include his hypertension?  The clinician is advised that the service-connected disability need not be the sole cause of the claimed disability.

(c) Is it at least as likely as not (the likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's headaches disability is aggravated (any increase in disability) by his service-connected disabilities, to include hypertension?  If aggravation is found, the clinician must identify a baseline (the disability level of the left and or right shoulder prior to the aggravation).
