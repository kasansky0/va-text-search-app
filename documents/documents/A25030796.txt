ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for acne keloidalis is granted.

Entitlement to service connection for unspecified depressive disorder with anxiety is granted.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1.  A January 2021 rating decision granted service connection for acne keloidalis and for unspecified depressive disorder with anxiety for treatment purposes only under 38 U.S.C. chapter 17 based on the period of service from September 13, 1988, to December 30, 1991.  The Board will not disturb this favorable finding.

2.  The Veteran's character of discharge was successfully upgraded to "general (under honorable conditions)" by the Board for Corrections of Naval Records (BCNR) effective April 2023.   

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection acne keloidalis and for unspecified depressive disorder with anxiety, for VA compensation purposes, are met.  38?U.S.C. §§?1110, 5104A, 5107(b), 5303; 38?C.F.R. §§?3.12, 3.102, 3.303.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from September 1988 to December 1991.     

The Board notes that while the Veteran initially received an under other than honorable discharge from service, barring him to VA compensation benefits, the character of his discharge was successfully upgraded to "general (under honorable conditions)" by the Board for Corrections of Naval Records (BCNR) effective April 2023.   

Notably, under 38?C.F.R. §?3.12(f), an honorable discharge or discharge under honorable conditions issued through a board for correction of records established under authority of 10 U.S.C. 1552 is final and conclusive on the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).     

As such, the action of the BCNR sets aside any prior bar to benefits imposed under 38?C.F.R. §?3.12 and the criteria for establishing status as a veteran for the purposes of receiving VA benefits have been met in this case.  38 U.S.C. §?5303; 38?C.F.R. §?3.12.    

The Veteran appeals a January 2021 rating decision.  See VA Form 10182 (AMA Notice of Disagreement), received March 2021.

In the Veteran's Appeals Modernization Act (AMA) Notice of Disagreement (NOD), he elected the Hearing Review option; therefore, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal, as well as any evidence submitted by the appellant or his or her representative at the hearing or within 90 days following the hearing.  38 C.F.R. § 20.302(a).

In December 2024, the Veteran testified at a videoconference hearing before a Veterans Law Judge other than the undersigned.  Under the AMA, unlike the Legacy Appeal System, the undersigned Veterans Law Judge may adjudicate the appeal even though a different Veterans Law Judge held the Veteran's hearing.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.706.  A transcript of the hearing is associated with the claims file and has been reviewed.

The Board highlights the Veteran submitted his upgraded character of discharge evidence within 90 days following the hearing and therefore it is properly before the Board for consideration in this claim.

Lastly, the Board highlights that this appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 C.F.R. Section 20.902(c).  See 38 U.S.C. § 7107(b)(1).

Service Connection Claims

1. Entitlement to service connection for acne keloidalis

2. Entitlement to service connection for unspecified depressive disorder with anxiety

The Veteran asserts he is entitled to VA compensation for service connection for acne keloidalis and unspecified depressive disorder with anxiety.

Generally, to establish service connection a Veteran must show: "(1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease incurred or aggravated during service."  Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1315-16 (Fed. Cir. 2009).   

In this regard, the record shows that the RO in a January 2021 rating decision adjudicated entitlement to service connection and granted the appellant's claim for acne keloidalis and for unspecified depressive disorder with anxiety, finding his under other than honorable discharge at the time was a bar to VA compensation benefits.

The grant of service connection in the January 2021 rating decision was based on the appellant's period of service, from September 1988 to December 1991, for which he is now not barred from receiving VA compensation benefits, due to his character of discharge upgrade by the BCNR under 10 U.S.C. 1552, made effective April 2023.  See also 38?C.F.R. §?3.12(f).

Accordingly, to fully address the issues before the Board in this claim, the Board must consider the Veteran's claim as a claim for service connection for VA compensation benefits for the claimed conditions on appeal.  

In this regard, the Board has decided to grant the claims based on the favorable findings made by the AOJ in the January 2021 rating.  See 38 U.S.C. 5104A.

To this extent only, the appeal as to entitlement to service connection for VA compensation purposes for acne keloidalis and for unspecified depressive disorder with anxiety is granted, to avoid a possible confusion with the January 2021 grant already awarded.  Cf. Sabonis v. Brown, 6?Vet. App.?426, 430 (1994) (where the law and not the evidence is dispositive, the Board should deny the claim on the ground of lack of legal merit).
