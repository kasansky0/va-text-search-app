ORDER

An annual clothing allowance for the 2020 calendar year for a back brace is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran's back brace, worn to treat a service-connected disability, for the 2020 calendar year, tended to wear out or tear his clothing.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for a clothing allowance for the 2020 calendar year for a back brace are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1162, 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.810.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1975 to June 1979.  This appeal is before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a July 2020 decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ).  In his September 2020 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Evidence Submission docket.  

The law provides for payment of an annual clothing allowance for each veteran who, because of a service-connected disability, wears or uses a prosthetic or orthopedic appliance (including a wheelchair) which VA determines tends to wear out or tear the clothing of the veteran, or uses medication which a physician has prescribed for a skin condition which is due to a service-connected disability and VA determines causes irreparable damage to the veteran's outer garments.  38 U.S.C. § 1162.  The implementing regulation, 38 C.F.R. § 3.810, provides, in pertinent part, that an annual clothing allowance may be granted when the Under Secretary for Health or a designee certifies that a veteran, because of a service-connected disability or disabilities, wears or uses one qualifying prosthetic or orthopedic appliance (including, but not limited to, a wheelchair) which tends to wear or tear clothing, or that a veteran uses medication prescribed by a physician for one skin condition, which is due to a service-connected disability, that causes irreparable damage to the veteran's outer garments.  38 C.F.R. § 3.810(a)(1)(ii).

An annual clothing allowance for the 2020 calendar year for a back brace is granted.

As reflected in his March 2020 application for benefits, the Veteran is claiming a clothing allowance for 2020 for a lumbosacral corset orthosis, issued to him in January 2018, which affects his back area.  On the application form, the Veteran provided signed certification that he regularly wore or used his back brace and that the back brace tended to wear out or tear his clothing.  Throughout 2020, the Veteran had the service-connected disability of lumbosacral strain with degenerative arthritis of the spine and intervertebral disc syndrome.   

VA treatment records reflect that, in January 2019, the Veteran requested a back brace for worsening lower back pain.  Following a consult with the VA Prosthetic Service, in January 2019, he was issued a large back brace.  

As reflected in the AOJ's July 2020 decision letter, it denied a 2020 clothing allowance for the Veteran's back brace on the basis that it was considered to be a nonqualifying device in accordance with the VHA Handbook, 1173.15.  See VHA Handbook, 1173.15, "Clothing Allowance," May 14, 2015 ("Examples of items that do not tend to tear and wear clothing include: Soft orthotics, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) units, shoes, shoe inserts, non-specialized wheelchairs (sedentary/sitting purposes), scooters, canes, rollador, walkers, elastic/flexible braces, items with Velcro stays, hinged braces covered in fabric (metal stays covered), braces with plastic stays covered in fabric").  However, the AOJ did not explain, and the record does not indicate, why the Veteran's back brace would not be a qualifying device in accordance with VHA policy.  

Affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that his back brace, during 2020, tended to wear out or tear his clothing.  The Veteran certified as much in his March 2020 application for benefits, and there is no evidence directly contradicting this statement.  

While the evidence in this matter is fairly scant, affording the Veteran the benefit of the doubt, the Board finds that his back brace, worn to treat a service-connected disability, for the 2020 calendar year, tended to wear out or tear his clothing.  Accordingly, an annual clothing allowance for the 2020 calendar year for a back brace must be granted.  See 38 U.S.C. § 5107.
