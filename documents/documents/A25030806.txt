REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from March 2009 to September 2009, with additional service with the Navy Reserve. 

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the May 2023 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the Supplemental Claim decision review option for additional development.

In the May 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. 

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) supplemental claim decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after the AOJ issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Withdrawal

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his authorized representative. 38 C.F.R. § 20.205. If a written withdrawal includes the name of the appellant and the file number and unambiguously identifies the claim to be withdrawn, then the withdrawal will be considered valid. Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 7 (2020).

On July 12, 2024, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Veteran withdrew the appeal of entitlement to service connection for bilateral elbow condition, bilateral wrist condition, lumbar spine condition, cervical condition, right shoulder condition and tinnitus. The Veteran specifically stated "[p]ursuant to 38 CFR §20.205 Rule 205. I wish to willing, knowingly, and voluntarily withdraw my claims at the Board included on VA Form 10182 filed May 21, 2024, for the following claims: Left Elbow Condition, Left Wrist Condition, Lumbar Strain, Neck Strain, Right Elbow Condition, Right Shoulder Condition, Right Wrist Condition, and Tinnitus. After discussing these claims with my new representative, I wish to pursue these claims for higher evaluations at the regional office level rather than the Board" See July 12, 2024 VA 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim. 

This communication includes the Veteran's name and applicable file number, and it also specifies that he was requesting to withdraw his appeal filed May 21, 2024, and the issues on appeal. This document constitutes an explicit and unambiguous withdrawal in accordance with the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b). The Board further notes that no other appeal was pending as of July 2024. Furthermore, the record shows that the Veteran subsequently iled a VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim for the issues withdrawn here.

The record contains no evidence or argument suggesting that the withdrawal is invalid. Martinez v. McDonough, 36 Vet. App. 320 (2023).

As the Veteran has withdrawn the appeal, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review this claim on appeal, and it is dismissed.
