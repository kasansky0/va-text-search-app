DOCKET NO. 210121-503790
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

Entitlement to payment or reimbursement for the Veteran's dental treatment by a non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facility on December 4, 2019, (Claim ID:302034500067159000) is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

While the appeal was pending, the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ) administratively reversed its initial finding that the appellant's claim for payment or reimbursement for the Veteran's non-VA treatment in December 2019 and notified the appellant that the claim would be reprocessed for approval.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.801.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The appellant is a non-VA treatment provider who sought reimbursement or payment for non-VA dental care of the Veteran.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) from a December 2020 decision. The Appellant filed a Decision Review Request: Board Appeal in December 2021.

A February 2022 letter informed the appellant that, upon secondary review, the appellant's appeal for the denial due to timeliness had been approved.  That letter informed the Appellant that the claim for the care rendered from December 4, 2019, would be reprocessed.

The administrative action approving the reprocessing of the payment for the treatment in question constitutes a complete grant of the benefits sought. As a result, no determination remains with which the Appellant disagrees, and the appeal is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 7105(d); 38 C.F.R. § 20.801(b).
