FINDING OF FACT

On March 31, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision, the appellant withdrew his appeal for entitlement an initial evaluation in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the claim of entitlement to an initial evaluation in excess of 10 percent for tinnitus are met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205. Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.  In the present case, the Veteran withdrew the above referenced appeal and, hence, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  

As such, this appeal is dismissed as a matter of law, as there remains no case or controversy, or dispute of fact or law, remaining regarding the issue. 38 U.S.C. § 7105. Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
