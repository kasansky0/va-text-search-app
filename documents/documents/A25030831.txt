ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran was not shown to have a current bilateral hearing loss disability, for VA regulatory purposes.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for bilateral hearing loss were not met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.159, 3.303, 3.385.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the Army from January 2008 to February 2011. He served in combat, as is shown by his receipt of the Combat Infantryman Badge.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a February 2024 rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).

In July 2024, the Veteran filed a VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement) (NOD). He elected the Direct Review docket. Thus, the Board may only consider evidence received through the date of the appealed decision. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

New evidence was received after the rating decision on appeal that could be relevant to the issue adjudicated herein, but that may not be considered here. If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Pursuant to the Veterans Claims Assistance Act (VCAA), VA has duties to notify and assist claimants in substantiating a claim for VA benefits. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5102, 5103, 5103A, 5107 (2012); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.156(a), 3.159 (2022). There is no evidence of any VA error in notifying or assisting the Veteran that reasonably affected the fairness of this adjudication. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159. The Board notes a VA examiner provided a negative nexus opinion in February 2024 as to the etiology of the Veteran's hearing loss. The audiogram of record during the appeal period did not establish a current hearing loss disability for VA purposes, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. As a result, the nexus opinion does not impact the reasoning for the Board's denial of this claim.

The Veteran did not raise any other issues with respect to VA's duty to notify or assist. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (holding that "the Board's obligation to read filings in a liberal manner does not require the Board... to search the record and address procedural arguments when the veteran fails to raise them before the Board"); Dickens v. McDonald, 814 F.3d 1359, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (applying Scott to a duty to assist argument).

The Board is aware that, under 38 U.S.C. § 1168, a disability examination and medical opinion may be requested for certain non-presumptive conditions involving toxic exposure risk activities (TERA). More specifically, the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act) requires the completion of a TERA examination "when there is evidence of a disability" and evidence of participation in a TERA. 38 U.S.C. § 1168(a). Here, the February 2024 VA medical opinion addressed the possibility of a link between the Veteran's hearing loss and his participation in a TERA, finding the claimed condition was less likely than not caused by the TERA. See 38 C.F.R. § 1168(b).

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral hearing loss is denied.

The Veteran seeks service connection for bilateral hearing loss. On his August 2023 claim form, he stated he was exposed to loud noises as an infantryman mortarman. VA acknowledged the Veteran was exposed to hazardous noise in service given his military occupational specialty (MOS) of Indirect Fire Infantryman. This is consistent with the circumstances of his service, particularly his combat service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1145(b). However, because the record does not show he met the regulatory criteria for a current hearing loss disability in either ear, this claim must be denied.

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a link between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Romanowsky v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 289, 293 (2013).

Service connection may also be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge, when all the evidence, including that pertinent to service, establishes that the disability was incurred in service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).

Impaired hearing is considered a disability when the auditory thresholds in any of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 40 decibels or greater; or when the auditory thresholds for at least three of the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, or 4000 Hertz are 26 decibels or greater; or when speech recognition scores using the Maryland CNC Test are less than 94 percent. 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. Hearing loss does not constitute a disability if it does not meet the threshold requirements for 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. Palczewski v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 174, 179-80 (2007).

In this case, the Veteran's service treatment records do not demonstrate he complained of or received treatment for a hearing loss disability, as contemplated under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, while in service. Audiological testing in service was negative for a hearing loss disability.

The Veteran filed his claim for service connection in August 2023. The Board has carefully reviewed the evidence since the claim was received. On review, however, the lay and medical evidence demonstrates he was not diagnosed with a hearing loss disability in either ear, under VA regulation, at any time during the pendency of his appeal. There is no objective evidence of record to indicate the Veteran was ever diagnosed with a hearing loss disability. See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007); Romanowsky, 26 Vet. App. 289. Furthermore, notwithstanding his service connection claim, the Veteran has not reported being diagnosed with a hearing loss disability in either ear under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 during the pendency of his appeal. See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

The Veteran received a VA Compensation and Pension (C&P) examination in December 2023. Audiological testing revealed pure tone thresholds, in decibels, as follows

:

  	 	 	HERTZ	 	 

 	500	1000	2000	3000	4000

RIGHT	25 	20	25	30	25

LEFT	25 	25	25	35	35

Speech audiometry revealed speech recognition ability of 96 percent in the right ear and 98 percent in the left ear. The examiner noted the audiogram results were valid and the use of word discrimination results was appropriate for the Veteran. It was noted the Veteran had sensorineural hearing loss in both ears. Acoustic immittance, ipsilateral acoustic reflexes, and contralateral acoustic reflexes were normal in both ears. In terms of functional impact, the Veteran reported it was hard to hear his stepson or when people were talking at a lower volume. This affected both his daily life and his work activities. The examiner again acknowledged the Veteran's in-service hazardous noise exposure. The Veteran denied any post-service occupational noise exposure and stated that he was not sure how long he had struggled to hear. He denied any recreational or social noise exposure either during or post-service.

In February 2024, the VA audiologist provided a negative nexus opinion. The audiologist stated the Veteran had normal hearing at entrance into service, as noted by his examination. There was no separation audiogram found in the claims file; however, the hearing test done in December 2023 (referenced above) showed normal hearing per VA guidelines. The audiologist stated this indicated no permanent damage to the auditory system. Additionally, the audiologist noted there was no current peer reviewed research linking hearing loss to TERAs and therefore the claimed condition was less likely than not caused by TERAs in Southwest Asia, after considering the total potential exposure through all applicable military deployments of the Veteran and the synergistic combined effect of all TERAs of the Veteran.

The Board sympathizes with the Veteran's reports of hearing loss, and to be clear this decision does not question those reports. However, the Board has no choice in this case but to find that the evidence of record is against the Veteran's claim that he suffered from a hearing loss disability, for VA purposes, at any point during the appeal period. The only positive evidence indicating the Veteran had a hearing loss disability under VA regulatory criteria are his reports of hearing loss and the fact he submitted an application for service connection. Unfortunately, this is not enough to find the criteria of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 were met.

The Board acknowledges the Veteran is competent to relate symptoms within the realm of his personal knowledge, just as he is competent to relate what he has been told by a medical professional. Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 469-70 (1994); Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377. He would certainly be competent to testify as to symptoms of hearing loss, in particular (as he has done here). However, in this case, the lay evidence of record does not establish a hearing loss disability in either ear that qualified for a current disability under the specific requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. 

The question of whether the Veteran had a hearing loss disability, for VA purposes, is a complex medical question dependent on objective findings and not capable of lay observation. See Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376; Barr v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 308-309 (2007) (finding that lay testimony is competent to establish the presence of varicose veins). Here, the December 2023 audiogram, completed by a VA medical professional, indicated the Veteran did not have a hearing loss disability in either ear under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385. The C&P report and the audiologist's comments, which acknowledged the Veteran's reports of hearing loss in both ears as well as his in-service history of hazardous noise exposure, indicate an appreciation of the nuances of the Veteran's situation but do not outweigh the specific audiological evaluation findings, which establish the criteria under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385 were not met. The Board reiterates the Veteran reported hearing loss and was diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss in both ears; however, again, none of the relevant evidence demonstrates he was ever diagnosed with a hearing loss disability, under 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, during the appeal period.

Congress has specifically limited entitlement to service-connected benefits to cases where there is a current disability. In the absence of proof of a present disability, there can be no valid claim. Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223 (1992). Given the absence of any persuasive evidence of a hearing loss disability in either ear, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.385, at any point during the pendency of the Veteran's appeal, his claim must be denied. 

The evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximately so with regard to the claim; rather, the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim. The benefit of the doubt doctrine, see 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b), is not for application. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).
