REMANDED

Entitlement to a rating higher than 30 percent for TMJ pain is remanded.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The reduction of the Veteran's TMJ pain was based on a November 2020 VA examination that was inadequate.  

2. The current 40 percent disability rating for the Veteran's fibromyalgia is the maximum schedular rating.

3. The Veteran's persistent depressive disorder with unspecified anxiety disorder does not manifest by total occupational and social impairment.

4. The Veteran's bronchial asthma is manifest by intermittent inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy.

5. The Veteran's shin splints of the left lower extremity requires treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months and is unresponsive to either orthotics or other conservative treatment.  

6. The Veteran's shin splints of the right lower extremity require treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months and is unresponsive to either orthotics or other conservative treatment.  

7. The Veteran's left wrist neurological symptoms are manifest by mild incomplete paralysis of the median nerve.

8.  The Veteran's right wrist neurological symptoms are manifest by mild incomplete paralysis of the median nerve.

9. The Veteran has met the basic eligibility for DEA benefits from May 1, 2021, the date from which the Veteran has a combined total disability rating.

10. The restoration of the 30 percent disability rating for TMJ pain results in the assignment of a combined rating of 100 percent throughout the period on appeal, which renders the issue of entitlement to a TDIU moot.

10. The restoration of a 30 percent rating for TMJ pain throughout the period on appeal renders the issue of entitlement to a TDIU moot and it is dismissed. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.340, 3.341, 4.16.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1995 to November 1998.

A February 2021 rating decision reduced the thirty percent rating that had been assigned for the Veteran's TMJ pain to 20 percent effective May 1, 2021. In January 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review, requesting restoration of the 30 percent rating. A February 2022 rating decision continued the 20 percent rating.

In December 2022, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0995, Supplemental Claim, seeking restoration of and an increased rating for TMJ and requesting entitlement to a TDIU. Entitlement to a higher rating for TMJ pain was denied by a March 2023 rating decision. A May 2023 rating decision denied entitlement to a higher rating for TMJ, found eligibility to DEA was established from December 30, 2022, denied a rating higher than 40 percent for fibromyalgia, denied a rating higher than 70 percent for persistent depressive disorder, denied a rating higher than 10 percent for bronchial asthma, denied a rating higher than 10 percent for shin splints of each lower extremity, and denied a rating higher than 10 percent for neurological symptoms of each wrist. 

In the March 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the May 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by applying the criteria set forth in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities found in 38 C.F.R. Part 4.  Disability ratings are intended to compensate impairment in earning capacity due to a service-connected disorder.  38 U.S.C. § 1155.  Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Schedule, but that findings sufficient to identify the disease and the resulting disability and above all, coordination of the rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21; see also Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).  

Evaluation of a service-connected disorder requires a review of the veteran's entire medical history regarding that disorder.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  When a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant.  38 C.F.R. § 4.3.  If there is a question as to which evaluation to apply to the veteran's disability, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria for that rating.  Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  

In all claims for an increased disability rating, VA has a duty to consider the possibility of assigning staged ratings.  See Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).  Where the evidence contains factual findings that demonstrate distinct time periods in which the service-connected disability exhibited diverse symptoms meeting the criteria for different ratings during the course of the appeal, the assignment of staged ratings is necessary.  

Disability of the musculoskeletal system is primarily the inability, due to damage or infection in the parts of the system, to perform the normal working movements of the body with normal excursion, strength, speed, coordination, and endurance.  It is essential that the examination on which ratings are based adequately portray the anatomical damage and the functional loss with respect to all of these elements.  In evaluating disabilities of the musculoskeletal system, it is necessary to consider functional loss due to flare-ups of pain, fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, and weakness.  DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202 (1995).  The functional loss may be due to absence of part, or all, of the necessary bones, joints and muscles, or associated innervation, or other pathology and evidenced by visible behavior of the claimant undertaking the motion.  Weakness is as important as limitation of motion, and a part that becomes painful on use must be regarded as seriously disabled.  38 C.F.R. § 4.40.  Pain on movement, swelling, deformity or atrophy of disuse as well as instability of station, disturbance of locomotion, interference with sitting, standing and weight bearing are relevant considerations for determination of joint disabilities.  38 C.F.R. § 4.45.  Painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, are entitled to at least the minimal compensable rating for the joint.  38 C.F.R. § 4.59; Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011) (holding that 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 applies to disabilities other than arthritis).  However, painful motion alone is not a functional loss without some restriction of the normal working movements of the body.  Mitchell v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 32, 43 (2011). 

The evaluation of the same disability under various diagnoses is to be avoided.  38 C.F.R. § 4.14.  Both the use of manifestations not resulting from service-connected disease or injury in establishing the service-connected evaluation, and the evaluation of the same manifestation under different diagnoses are to be avoided.  Id.; Esteban v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 259 (1994).  

1. Restoration of the Veteran's prior 30 percent rating for TMJ pain

The Veteran contends that his 30 percent rating for TMJ pain should be restored because the reduction was improper.

The Board finds that the reduction was not supported by evidence that showed actual improvement in the severity of the Veteran's TMJ.

A disability rating shall not be reduced unless an improvement in the disability is shown to have occurred. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344. When reduction in the rating of a service-connected disability is contemplated and the lower rating would result in a reduction or discontinuance of compensation payments, a rating proposing the reduction or discontinuance will be prepared setting forth all material facts and reasons. The beneficiary must be notified at the latest address of record of the contemplated action and furnished detailed reasons therefore. The beneficiary must be given 60 days for the presentation of additional evidence to show that compensation payments should be continued at the present level. 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e). The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105 (e) do not apply where there is no reduction in the amount of compensation payable. See VAOPGCPREC 71-91 (Nov. 1991); Stelzel v. Mansfield, 508 F.3d 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

In this case, the Veteran was offered an examination to evaluate the severity of her TMJ pain in November 2020. VA notified the Veteran of a proposal to reduce the rating for TMJ pain in a December 2020 rating decision, and informed the Veteran that she could request a personal hearing in the accompanying letter. The Veteran did not do so, and VA went on to reduce the rating in the February 2021 rating decision, effective May 1, 2021. VA thus met the procedural requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e).

The 30 percent rating was in effect from June 8, 2011, to May 1, 2021, which is more than five years. When a rating has been in effect for five years or more, a rating may be reduced only if the examination on which the reduction is based is at least as full and complete as that used to establish the higher rating. Ratings for diseases subject to temporary or episodic improvement will not be reduced on the basis of any one examination, except in those instances where the evidence of record clearly warrants the conclusion that sustained improvement has been demonstrated.

Moreover, though material improvement in the mental or physical condition is clearly reflected, the rating agency will consider whether the evidence makes it reasonably certain that the improvement will be maintained under the ordinary conditions of life. 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (a).

Where a rating has not been in effect for five years or more, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (a) and (b) are not determinative. Instead, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (c) apply. Under 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (c), reduction is warranted where an adequate examination shows actual improvement in a veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work. Faust v. West, 13 Vet. App. 342, 350 (2000); see also 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 (c). A rating reduction requires an inquiry as to "whether the evidence reflects an actual change in the disability, and whether the examination reports reflecting such a change are based upon thorough examinations." Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413, 421 (1993). Such an inquiry must be based upon a review of the entire history of the veteran's disability. 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2, 4.10.

Importantly, as noted above, the examination reports on which the reductions are based must be adequate. See Tucker v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 201 (1992). If the examination reports justifying the rating reduction are inadequate, the reduction cannot be upheld. Id. 

The burden of proof is on VA to establish that a reduction is warranted by the weight of the evidence. Kitchens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 320 (1995). A claim as to whether a rating reduction was proper must be resolved in the veteran's favor unless VA concludes that a fair preponderance of the evidence weighs against the claim. Brown v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 413 (1993).

During the relevant period, the Veteran's TMJ point was rated under DC 9905. Under this DC, interincisal range with unassisted vertical limited to 21 to 29 millimeters (mm) is assigned a 20 percent rating without dietary restrictions to mechanically altered foods, a 30 percent rating with dietary restrictions to soft and semi-solid foods, and a 40 percent rating with dietary restrictions to full liquid and pureed foods. Interincisal range with unassisted vertical opening of 11 to 20 mm is assigned a 30 percent rating without dietary restrictions to mechanically altered foods, and a 40 percent rating with dietary restrictions to full liquid and pureed foods. Interincisal range with a maximum unassisted vertical opening of 0 to 10 mm is assigned a 40 percent rating without dietary restrictions to mechanically altered foods, and a 50 percent rating with dietary restrictions to all mechanically altered foods. 38 C.F.R. § 4.150, DC 9905. 

The reduction was based upon a December 2020 VA examination showing that the inter-incisal distance was 21 to 29 millimeters (mm) and that the Veteran does not require a mechanically altered foods diet. However, the examiner did not complete the section of the Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) noting inter-incisal distance during flare-ups, in spite of finding that pain does significantly limit the Veteran' functional ability with flare-ups. Failure to determine inter-incisal distance during flare-ups as expressed in estimated range of motion renders the examinations inadequate. Sharp v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 26, 34-36 (2017); DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. at 206. Without describing limitations during flare-ups, the examinations do not demonstrate actual improvement in a veteran's ability to function under the ordinary conditions of life and work.

Because the evidence does not reflect that the Veteran's TMJ pain materially improved under the ordinary conditions of life and work, which would include flare-ups, the reduction from 30 percent to 20 percent was improper. The AOJ failed to properly apply the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.344(c) by relying upon inadequate examinations that did not find improvement under the ordinary conditions of life and work. Accordingly, the reduction is void ab initio, and the previously assigned 30 percent rating for the Veteran's TMJ pain is restored, effective as of May 1, 2021.

2. Entitlement to a rating higher than 40 percent for fibromyalgia

The Veteran contends that she should be assigned a rating higher than 40 percent for fibromyalgia, but she has not offered any argument in support of this contention.

Under DC 5025, fibromyalgia is described with symptoms of widespread musculoskeletal pain and tender points, with or without associated fatigue, sleep disturbance, stiffness, paresthesias, headache, irritable bowel symptoms, depression, anxiety, or Raynaud's-like symptoms. A maximum 40 percent rating is assigned for symptoms which are constant, or nearly constant, and refractory to therapy. A 40 percent rating is the maximum schedular rating available under DC 5025, and thus, a higher rating is not available under that code. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5025.

During the entire period on appeal, the Veteran has been in receipt of the maximum schedular rating under VA's laws and regulations for fibromyalgia. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, DC 5025. The Veteran's fibromyalgia should not be rated under another diagnostic code as DC 5025 specifically compensates symptoms of fibromyalgia. See Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538 (1993) (holding that the assignment of a particular diagnostic code is "completely dependent on the facts of a particular case.").

Since the Veteran's fibromyalgia has been assigned the maximum schedular rating available, the Board finds there is no legal basis upon which to award a higher schedular evaluation for this disability. See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426 (1994).

The Veteran has not alleged, and the Board's review of the record does not reveal, unusual fibromyalgia symptoms that are not contemplated by DC 5025. Accordingly, the Board concludes that the most persuasive evidence of record is against the claim for a rating higher than 40 percent for fibromyalgia.

3. Entitlement to a rating higher than 70 percent for persistent depressive disorder with unspecified anxiety disorder

The Veteran contends that she should be assigned a rating higher than 70 percent for her persistent depressive disorder, but she has not offered specific argument in support of that contention.

The Veteran has been assigned a 70 percent rating under DC 9433, persistent depressive disorder, which is evaluated under the General Formula for Mental Disorders (General Formula).

Under the General Formula, the Board must conduct a "holistic analysis" that considers all associated symptoms, regardless of whether they are listed as criteria. Bankhead v. Shulkin, 29 Vet. App. 10 (2017); 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.  The Board must determine whether unlisted symptoms are similar in severity, frequency, and duration to the listed symptoms associated with specific disability percentages.  Then, the Board must determine whether the associated symptoms, both listed and unlisted, caused the level of impairment required for a higher disability rating. Vazquez-Claudio v. Shinseki, 713 F.3d 112, 114-118 (Fed. Cir. 2013). 

The issue in this appeal is whether the Veteran's associated symptoms caused the level of impairment required for a disability rating higher than 70 percent. The Board finds that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms do not support the assignment of a rating higher than 70 percent.

A 70 percent rating is assigned when symptoms such as suicidal ideation; obsessional rituals which interfere with routine activities; intermittently illogical, obscure, or irrelevant speech; near-continuous panic or depression affecting the ability to function independently, appropriately and effectively; impaired impulse control (such as unprovoked irritability with periods of violence); spatial disorientation; neglect of personal appearance and hygiene; difficulty in adapting to stressful circumstances (including work or a worklike setting); or inability to establish and maintain effective relationships cause occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, or mood.

A 100 percent rating is assigned for total occupational and social impairment, due to such symptoms as: gross impairment in thought processes or communication; persistent delusions or hallucinations; grossly inappropriate behavior; persistent danger of hurting self or others; intermittent inability to perform activities of daily living (including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene); disorientation to time or place; or memory loss for names of close relatives, own occupation or own name. 38 C.F.R. § 4.130.

In this case, the January 2023 VA examination found that the Veteran had occupational and social impairment with deficiencies in most areas, such as work, school, family relations, judgment, thinking, and/or mood. This finding is consistent with the 70 percent rating that has been assigned. The Veteran reported a caring and loving relationship with her husband of 19 years and her adult son. This loving relationship with her family indicates that she does not have total social impairment.

Although the Veteran reported suicidal thinking every day, she denied any current plan for suicide, and any history of suicide attempts. The examiner found there is no persistent danger of the Veteran hurting herself or others. Suicidal ideation that does not rise to the level of persistent danger of hurting oneself is expressly contemplated by the 70 percent rating the Veteran has been assigned. 

The Veteran's thought processing was logical and goal directed, her thought content was intact, and there was no evidence of psychotic thinking or grossly inappropriate behavior. The examiner found that there was no evidence of disorganized or grossly inappropriate behavior, and that the Veteran was not disoriented to time and place. Although the Veteran reported that she could not engage in hygiene, the examiner noted that the Veteran's grooming was intact, and she was able to attend to all daily living skills. The Veteran reported that she has tremendous anxiety to leave the home and is scared of doing things alone, but that she can talk herself into the steps of getting ready for an appointment, although doing so is laborious. 

Because the examiner found that the Veteran was appropriately groomed and able to maintain personal hygiene, the Board finds that the Veteran's report of inability to engage in hygiene such as bathing is better characterized as a report that she is unable to meet her personal standard of hygiene, which is most appropriately described as neglect of personal appearance and hygiene and contemplated by the 70 percent rating that has been assigned. The record reflects that the Veteran is able to maintain minimal personal hygiene. Additionally, the fact that the Veteran is able to leave her house with difficulty and attend appointments despite her anxiety if she talks her through the steps indicates that her anxiety affects her ability to function independently, appropriately, and effectively, but does not result in grossly inappropriate behavior. This level of impairment is also contemplated by the 70 percent rating that has been assigned.

A March 2023 VA treatment note found that the Veteran's affect was mildly anxious and that there was no evidence of danger to the Veteran or others, no evidence of hallucinations, delusions, or thought disorder, and memory and attention within normal limit. This treatment note is also consistent with a finding that the Veteran's depressive disorder does not result in total occupational and social impairment.

The record thus reflects that the Veteran's overall social or occupational impairment does not meet or more closely approximate the level of total occupational and social impairment. Entitlement to a rating higher than 70 percent is denied. 

4. Entitlement to a rating higher than 10 percent for bronchial asthma

The Veteran contends that she should be assigned a rating higher than 10 percent for bronchial asthma but has not submitted specific argument in support of that contention.

The Veteran's bronchial asthma is rated under DC 6602. Under DC 6602, a 10 percent rating is assigned when pulmonary function testing (PFT) shows forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV-1) is 71-80 percent of the predicted amount, or; FEV-1/forced vital capacity (FVC) is 71-80 percent of the predicted amount, or; intermittent inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy is used. A 30 percent rating is warranted where FEV-1 is 56 to 70 percent predicted; FEV-1/FVC is 56 to 70 percent; or there is daily inhalational or oral bronchodilator therapy, or inhalational anti-inflammatory medication. A 60 percent rating is warranted where FEV-1 is 40 to 55 percent predicted; FEV-1/FVC of 40 to 55 percent; or at least monthly visits to a physician for required care of exacerbations, or intermittent (at least three per year) courses of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroids. A 100 percent disability rating is warranted where FEV-1 of less than 40 percent predicted; FEV-1/FVC of less than 40 percent; or more than one attack per week with episodes of respiratory failure, or where the use of systemic high dose corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications are required on a daily basis. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6602.

The post-bronchodilator findings for these pulmonary function tests (PTF) are the standard in pulmonary assessment. See 61 Fed. Reg. 46720, 46723 (Sept. 5, 1996) (VA assesses pulmonary function after bronchodilation). However, if the post-bronchodilator results are poorer than the pre-bronchodilator results, then the pre- bronchodilator results are used for rating purposes. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.96 (d)(5).

The February 2023 VA examination found that the Veteran's asthma is treated with intermittent inhalational bronchodilator therapy. The post-bronchodilatory PFT findings indicate that FVC was 96 of the predicted amount, FEV-1 was 104 percent predicted, and FEV-1/FVC was 107 percent predicted. These findings are consistent with the 10 percent rating that has been assigned. There is no evidence of daily inhalational or oral bronchodilatory therapy, or of inhalational anti-inflammatory medication. An April 2023 VA treatment record described the Veteran's asthma symptoms as slight.

For the foregoing reasons, the record does not support the assignment of a rating higher than 10 percent for the Veteran's asthma. The Veteran's claim must be denied.

5. Entitlement to a rating higher than 10 percent for left lower extremity shin splints

6. Entitlement to a rating higher than 10 percent for right lower extremity shin splints

The Veteran contends that she should be assigned a rating higher than 10 percent for shin splints of each lower extremity, but she has not submitted specific argument in support of this contention.

The Veteran's shin splints have been rated under DC 5262. Under DC 5262, shin splints requiring treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment of one or both lower extremities are assigned a 10 percent disability rating. Shin splints of one lower extremity requiring treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment are assigned a 20 percent rating. Shin splints of both lower extremities requiring treatment for no less than 12 consecutive months, and unresponsive to surgery and either shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment are assigned a 30 percent rating. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DC 5262. Although 30 percent is the highest possible rating for shin plaints, a 40 percent rating is available for nonunion of the tibia and fibula with loose motion, requiring a brace, and malunion of the tibia and fibula is to be evaluated under DCs 5256, 5257, 5260, 5261 for the knee or 5270 or 5271, whichever results in the highest evaluation. Id. There is no evidence of malunion or nonunion of the tibia and fibula in this case.

The January 2023 VA examination found that the Veteran's bilateral shin splints are treated by orthotic shoes, and are unresponsive to shoe orthotics or other conservative treatment. The examiner found that there has been no surgery of either knee. The Veteran's treatment records are consistent with these findings.

Because there is no evidence of surgery to treat the Veteran's shin splints, much less evidence that the Veteran's shin splints have been unresponsive to surgery, there is no basis to assign a rating higher than 10 percent for each lower extremity. The Veteran's claims must be denied.

7. Entitlement to a rating higher than 10 percent for left wrist neurological symptoms

8. Entitlement to a rating higher than 10 percent for right wrist neurological symptoms

The Veteran contends that she should be assigned a rating higher than 10 percent for neurological symptoms of each wrist. She has not offered specific argument in support of this contention.

The Veteran's neurological symptoms of the bilateral wrists have been rated under DC 8515, which relates to paralysis of the median nerve. Mild incomplete paralysis of the median nerve is assigned a 10 percent rating for either the major or minor extremity. Moderate incomplete paralysis of the median nerve of the major extremity is assigned a 30 percent rating, while the minor extremity is assigned a 20 percent rating. Severe incomplete paralysis of the median nerve of the major extremity is assigned a 50 percent rating, which the minor extremity is assigned a 40 percent rating. Complete paralysis of the median nerve, with the hand inclined to the ulnar side, the index and middle fingers more extended than normally, considerable atrophy of the muscles of the thenar eminence, the thumb in the plane of the hand (ape hand); pronation incomplete and defective, absence of flexion of index finger and feeble flexion of middle finger, where one cannot make a fist, index and middle fingers remain extended; where one cannot flex distal phalanx of thumb, defective opposition and abduction of the thumb, at right angles to palm; flexion of wrist weakened; pain with trophic disturbances, is assigned a 70 percent rating for the major extremity and a 60 percent rating for the minor extremity. 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, DC 8515.

The term "incomplete paralysis" indicates a degree of lost or impaired function substantially less than the type of picture for complete paralysis given with each nerve, whether due to varied level of the nerve lesion or to partial regeneration.  When the involvement is wholly sensory, the rating is for the mild, or at most, the moderate degree.  The disability ratings for the peripheral nerves are for unilateral involvement; when bilateral, the ratings combine with application of the bilateral factor.  38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Note at "Diseases of the Peripheral Nerves."  The Note to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a establishes a maximum disability rating for conditions that are wholly sensory, as opposed to a minimum disability rating for conditions that are more than wholly sensory.  See Miller v. Shulkin, 28 Vet. App. 376 (2017).  

The maximum rating which may be assigned for neuritis not characterized by organic changes will be moderately severe incomplete paralysis for sciatic nerve involvement.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.123.  

The words "mild," "moderate," and "severe" as used in the various Diagnostic Codes are not defined in the Rating Schedule. Regulations provide that ratings for peripheral neurological disorders are to be assigned based the relative impairment of motor function, trophic changes, or sensory disturbance.  38 C.F.R. § 4.120.  Consideration is also given for loss of reflexes, pain, and muscle atrophy.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.123, 4.124.

VA's Adjudication Procedures Manual (M21-1) provides benchmarks for mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe peripheral nerve conditions. Although the Board is not bound by the M21-1, the standards provided in the M21-1 are "relevant guidance promulgated for the purpose of facilitating the efficient and proper resolution of claims," which the Board must consider and address as part of its duty to provide a reasoned explanation for its decision. Healey v. McDonough, 33 Vet. App. 312 (2021); Overton v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 257 (2018).

The Board finds these definitions to be instructive. Per the M21-1, mild is described as the lowest level of evaluation for each nerve, and is the default assigned based on the symptoms, however slight, as long as they were sufficient to support a diagnosis of the peripheral nerve impairment. It is to be assigned when sensory deficits are lower graded, less persistent, or affecting a small area. A very minimal reflex or motor abnormality potentially could also be consistent with mild incomplete paralysis.

Moderate is described as the maximum evaluation reserved for the most significant cases of sensory-only impairment, in which symptoms will likely be described by the claimants and graded as significantly disabling, and in which a larger area in the nerve distribution may be affected. Other symptom combinations that may fall into the moderate category include the following: combinations of significant sensory changes and reflex or motor changes of a lower degree, or motor and/or reflex impairment such as weakness or diminished hyperactive reflexes (with or without sensory impairment) graded as medically moderate. M21-1, V.iii.12.A.2.c.

A "moderately severe" evaluation level includes motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, weakness or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a high level of limitation or disability and may include atrophy. 

To be described as "severe," it would be expected that there is motor and/or reflex impairment (for example, atrophy, weakness, or diminished or hyperactive reflexes) at a grade reflecting a very high level of limitation or disability. Trophic changes may be seen in severe longstanding neuropathy, and marked muscular atrophy is expected in cases involving the sciatic nerve. Id. 

A January 2023 VA treatment note found that the Veteran had normal muscle strength in the bilateral wrists in flexion and extension, as well as normal finger abduction and thumb abduction and flexion.

The January 2023 VA examination noted that the Veteran is right-handed, which means that the right wrist is the major extremity. The Veteran had bilateral mild intermittent pain, mild paresthesias and/or dysesthesias, and mild numbness. The Veteran's strength was rated as normal (5/5) with the exception of bilateral grip and pinch, which were rated as 4/5 (active movement against some resistance). The Veteran had normal deep tendon reflexes, normal sensory exam, and no trophic changes. The examiner found that the Veteran had mild incomplete paralysis of the median nerve bilaterally. The Veteran's neurological symptoms of the bilateral wrists were found to have no functional impact. 

The Veteran's sensory symptoms are all described as mild by the examiner, and objective testing of reflexes and sensation were normal. The Board finds that the Veteran's weakness of grip and pinch is very minimal because it was not noted in the January 2023 VA treatment note discussing muscle strength of the finger and thumb, which indicates that it is not always present, and because it was rated as 4/5, which is the most minimal rating for weakness. The examiner also found that the Veteran's neurological symptoms had no impact on the Veteran's ability to work, which indicates that there is not even the limited scope of impairment that would be consistent with medically moderate motor and/or reflex impairment. Because the Veteran's neurological symptoms of the bilateral wrists are mild subjective symptoms combined with very minimal weakness, the Board finds that the Veteran's disability of the bilateral wrists is best described as mild incomplete paralysis of the bilateral median nerve.

As there is no evidence of moderate incomplete paralysis of the median nerve for either wrist, the Board must deny the Veteran's claim for entitlement to a rating higher than 10 percent for neurological symptoms of each wrist.

9. Entitlement to basic eligibility to DEA under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 from May 1, 2021 

The Veteran contends that her basic eligibility to DEA should also be restored effective May 1, 2021.

DEA under Chapter 35, Title 38, of the United States Code, is a program of education or special restorative training that may be authorized for an eligible person if the applicable criteria are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 3500, 3501; 38 38 C.F.R. §§ 21.3020, 21.3021.

The child of a veteran will have basic eligibility for DEA benefits if the veteran was discharged from service under conditions other than dishonorable or died during service and the veteran has a permanent total service-connected disability, such a disability was in existence at the date of the veteran's death, or the veteran died as a result of a service-connected disability. 38 U.S.C. § 3501 (a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.807 (a), 21.3021.

Entitlement to DEA from May 1, 2021, is granted because that is the date from which the Veteran had a 100 percent combined disability rating. 

10. Entitlement to a TDIU 

With the restoration of the 30 percent rating for TMJ pain, the Veteran has a combined evaluation of 100 percent throughout the period on appeal. A 100 percent rating under the Schedule for Rating Disabilities means that a veteran is totally disabled and is the highest benefit available. TDIU is a lesser benefit that may be assigned "where the schedular rating is less than total" when the disabled person is unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful employment as a result of service-connected disabilities. 38 C.F.R. § 4.16(a). In some cases, a veteran may be assigned a 100 percent rating for one disability and receive entitlement to a TDIU based upon their other service-connected disabilities in order to meet the schedular requirements for entitlement to special monthly compensation (SMC) at the housebound rate. Bradley v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 280 (2008). This scenario does not apply in this case because the Veteran is not assigned a 100 percent rating for one disability, nor does she allege that she is unemployable solely because of a single service-connected disability. In the March 2024 brief the Veteran's representative argued that she was unemployable due to the combined effects of her service-connected disabilities. Therefore, entitlement to a TDIU is moot, and the claim is dismissed.

REASONS FOR REMAND

1. Entitlement to a rating higher than 30 percent for TMJ pain is remanded.

Because the November 2020 VA examination does not address inter-incisal distance during flare-ups, in spite of finding that the Veteran's pain causes functional loss during flare-ups, the examination is not adequate. Accepting this inadequate examination was a pre-decisional duty to assist error that must be remedied upon remand.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Schedule the Veteran for an examination by an appropriate clinician to determine the current severity of the service-connected TMJ pain. The examiner should provide a full description of the disability and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the Veteran's disability under the rating criteria. 

In so doing, the examiner should attempt to elicit information regarding the severity, frequency, and duration of any flare-ups, and the degree of functional loss during flare-ups.  If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement based on direct observation, the examiner should provide an estimate, if at all possible, of the additional impairment due to flare-ups based on the other evidence of record and the Veteran's statements, including the December 2022 correspondence.  If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement without speculation, the examiner must state whether the need to speculate is due to a deficiency in the state of general medical knowledge (no one could respond given medical science and the known facts), a deficiency in the record (additional facts are required), or the examiner (does not have the knowledge or training).

The examiner is also asked to discuss whether the Veteran's headaches, which are reported in the December 2022 correspondence, are secondary to her TMJ. The examiner must provide the following opinions as to headaches:

(a.) State whether, but for the Veteran's service-connected TMJ pain, she would not have had a diagnosis of headaches.

(b.) State whether the Veteran's headaches would have been less severe and result in less functional impairment but for the service-connected TMJ pain.

(c.) If the examiner opines that the headaches would have resulted in less functional impairment but for the service-connected TMJ pain, the clinician must attempt to establish a baseline level of severity of the diagnosed headaches prior to aggravation by the service-connected TMJ pain.

The examiner is advised that a service-connected disability need only be a contributing cause, not the contributing cause, to establish secondary service connection.

A complete rationale must be provided for all opinions, citing to supporting factual data and medical literature, as appropriate. If the examiner cannot provide an opinion without resort to speculation, the examiner must state why and what, if any, additional evidence would permit such an opinion to be made.
