ORDER

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for right knee instability, status post anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with post-traumatic osteoarthritis (right knee instability) is denied.

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee post-traumatic osteoarthritis (limitation of flexion) is denied.

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for left ankle post-traumatic osteoarthritis (resolved) and instability, status post failed ligamentous reconstruction (left ankle disability) is denied.

Entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for right first metatarsophalangeal joint (big toe), status post right foot bunionectomy, with post-traumatic arthritis (right great toe disability) is denied.

Entitlement to an initial disability rating in excess of 10 percent for tension headaches is denied.

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for hypertension is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The right knee instability disability was manifested by a repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability.  The right knee instability was not manifested by an unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a prescription for both an assistive device and bracing for ambulation.  

2. The right knee disability manifested by flexion limited to, at worst, 135 degrees during the claim period.  At no time was flexion limited to 30 degrees or less, even considering pain on use and during flareups.  

3. The left ankle disability is manifested by moderate limitation of motion, even considering pain on use and during flareups.  Marked limitation of motion is not shown and there is no clinical evidence of ankylosis, malunion or astragalectomy.

4. The 10 percent rating for the right great toe disability is the maximum rating for that disability.  

5. The tension headache disability manifested as prostrating headache attacks once every two months, the Veteran did not experience characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on average once a month over the last several months or very frequent prostrating and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.

6. The hypertension disability is not manifested by diastolic pressure predominantly 100 per more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more.  Additionally, while the Veteran does require continuous medication for control of the hypertension, he does not have a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more.  

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to a disability rating in excess of 20 percent for right knee instability, are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.2, 4.7, 4.10, 4.21, 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257.

6. The criteria for a compensable disability rating for hypertension are not met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 4.1, 4.2, 4.7, 4.10, 4.21, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.  

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1986 to August 2006.  This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from January 2024 rating decisions by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO).  

A January 2, 2024 rating decision adjudicated the claims for increased ratings for the right knee, left ankle and hypertension disabilities and a January 26, 2024 rating decision adjudicated the claims for increased ratings for the right great toe and headache disabilities.  Following the rating decisions, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) and selected the Direct Review docket.

Based upon the selection of the Direct Review option, the Board may only consider the evidence of record as of January 2, 2024 with respect to the right knee, left ankle and hypertension disabilities and January 26, 2024 with respect to the right great toe and headache disabilities-the respective dates of the rating decisions on appeal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If the Veteran submitted evidence that was added to the record after January 2, 2024 with respect to the right knee, left ankle and hypertension disabilities, or after January 26, 2024 with respect to the right great toe and headache disabilities, the Board did not consider it. If the Veteran wishes to have VA consider any evidence that was not considered, a supplemental claim should be submitted identifying such evidence.  See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.

Increased Ratings

Generally, disability ratings are determined by applying the rating criteria set forth in VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Rating Schedule) and represent the average impairment of earning capacity.  38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. § 4.1.  The basis of disability evaluations is the ability of the body as a whole, or of the psyche, or of a system or organ of the body to function under the ordinary conditions of daily life, including employment.  38 C.F.R. § 4.10. 

In determining the severity of a disability, the Board is required to consider the potential application of various other provisions of the regulations governing VA compensation, as well as the whole recorded history of the Veteran's disability.  38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.2; see generally Schafrath v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 589 (1991).  Where there is a question of which of two evaluations shall be applied, the higher evaluation will be assigned if the disability more closely approximates the criteria for that rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.7.  Otherwise, the lower rating is assigned.  Id.  Additionally, while it is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances.  38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

With respect to the right knee, left ankle and right great disabilities, the intent of the schedule is to recognize painful motion with joint or particular pathology as productive of disability.  It is the intention to recognize actually painful, unstable, or malaligned joints, due to healed injury, as entitled to at least the minimum compensable rating for the joint.  38 C.F.R. § 4.59.  The provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.59, which relate to painful motion, are not limited to arthritis and must be considered when raised by the Veteran or when reasonably raised by the record.  Burton v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 1 (2011).

When evaluating a disability based upon limitation of motion, the Board must also consider, in conjunction with the otherwise applicable diagnostic codes, any additional functional loss the veteran may have sustained by virtue of other factors as described in 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40 and 4.45.  DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 204-7 (1995).  Such factors include more or less movement than normal, weakened movement, excess fatigability, incoordination, pain on movement, swelling, and deformity or atrophy from disuse.  A finding of functional loss due to pain must be supported by adequate pathology and evidenced by the visible behavior of the veteran.  38 C.F.R. § 4.40; Johnston v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 80, 85 (1997).

Where the appellant has expressed dissatisfaction with the assignment of a rating, separate, or "staged," ratings can be assigned for separate periods of time based on the facts found.   Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999); Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

The Board notes that the relevant medical evidence for each increased disability rating claim is limited to VA examinations conducted for the disabilities in December 2023.  The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that the VA examinations were "rushed."  See Notice of Disagreement.  However, the Veteran did not raise this issue until after the January 2024 rating decision.  Additionally, a review of the December 2023 VA examination reports does not indicate that they were inadequate or that the Veteran reported that he felt rushed at the time of the examinations.  Rather, the examination reports reflect thorough examinations of the right great toe, left ankle, right knee, headache and hypertension disabilities.  The Board therefore finds that the examination findings are adequate and sufficient upon which to decide the appeal and that there was no pre-decisional duty to assist error on the part of the RO.  

The claim period for the increased ratings claims runs from January 5, 2023, the date VA received the Veteran's intent to file.  The claim for service connection for tension headaches was received July 19, 2023 and the claims for increased disability ratings for the right great toe, left ankle, right knee and hypertension disabilities were received on September 2, 2023.  As the claims were received within a year of the intent to file, the claim period runs from January 5, 2023.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(b).  For the non-initial increased disability rating claims, the Board will also consider whether it was factually ascertainable that an increase in disability occurred during the one year "look back" period preceding the submission of the claim. See 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2); Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 982 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Right Knee Disability

The Veteran has a 20 percent disability rating for right knee instability pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257 and a 10 percent rating for right knee limitation of flexion pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5260.  

Normal flexion of the knee is to 140 degrees, and normal extension of the knee is to 0 degrees. 38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.

Generally, the joints involved should be tested for pain on both active and passive motion, in weight-bearing and non-weightbearing and, if possible, with the range of the opposite undamaged joint. Correia v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 158, 168-69 (2016); 38 C.F.R. § 4.59.

Under Diagnostic Code 5257, a 10 percent rating is warranted for sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or complete ligament tear (repaired, unrepaired, or failed repair) causing persistent instability, without a prescription from a medical provider for an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation.  A 20 percent rating is warranted for (a) sprain, incomplete ligament tear, or repaired complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes a brace and/or assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) for ambulation, or (b) unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes either an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) or bracing for ambulation.  A 30 percent rating is warranted for unrepaired or failed repair of complete ligament tear causing persistent instability, and a medical provider prescribes both an assistive device (e.g., cane(s), crutch(es), walker) and bracing for ambulation.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257.

For patellar instability, the patellofemoral complex consists of the quadriceps tendon, the patella, and the patellar tendon.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257, Note (1). 

A surgical procedure that does not involve repair of one or more patellofemoral components that contribute to the underlying instability shall not qualify as surgical repair for patellar instability (including, but not limited to, arthroscopy to remove loose bodies and joint aspiration).  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5257, Note (2). 

Under Diagnostic Code 5260, leg flexion limited to 60 degrees warrants a noncompensable rating.  Leg flexion limited to 45 degrees warrants a 10 percent rating; 30 degrees warrants a 20 percent rating, and 15 degrees warrants a 30 percent rating. See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5260. 

The Veteran reported to the December 2023 VA examiner that he experienced pain, tightness, swelling, cramping behind the knee and giving out.  The Veteran also reported flareups of swelling, tightness and limited range of motion.  Initial active and passive range of motion was reported as normal with no evidence of pain.  The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing without additional loss of function or range of motion.  The examiner estimated range of motion would be reduced to flexion to 135 degrees with repeated use over time.  The examination was conducted during a flareup, and the examiner noted no loss of range of motion.  The examiner reported no muscle atrophy and no ankylosis.  The examiner also reported recurrent subluxation or persistent instability, a complete ligament tear that had been successfully repaired and the lack of any prescription for a brace or for assistance with ambulation.  The examiner noted an arthroscopic ligament repair surgery conducted in 2001, with residuals of pain, swelling and intermittent instability.  The examiner reported no recurrent patellar instability and no shin splints, stress fractures or other tibial or fibular impairment.  The examiner also reported that the Veteran did not have a meniscal condition.  The Veteran did not report the use of any assistive device for ambulation.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board concludes that a rating in excess of 20 percent is not warranted for right knee instability and a rating in excess of 10 percent is not warranted for right knee limitation of flexion.  The record reflects that the Veteran underwent a successful ligament repair surgery and experienced instability.  Although the December 2023 VA examination reflected that the Veteran was no longer prescribed a brace, cane or walker, the 20 percent rating for right knee instability was continued by the RO.  The evidence does not reflect an unrepaired or failed repair of a complete ligament tear causing persistent instability requiring a prescription or patellar instability, the criteria required for a rating in excess of 20 percent pursuant to Diagnostic Code 5257.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.  Nor does the evidence support a rating in excess of 10 percent for right knee limitation of flexion.  As noted, range of motion testing by the VA examiner does not reflect flexion to 30 degrees, including when considering repeated use over time and flareups.  Flexion was estimated at worst, to 135 degrees.  The Board finds, even considering the Veteran's complaints of pain, there is no objective evidence suggesting that the Veteran's range of motion was limited to 30 degrees, the measurement required for a 20 percent rating for painful flexion.  The Board has considered the De Luca factors and 38 C.F.R. § 4.59 and finds that a disability rating in excess of 10 percent for limitation of flexion is not warranted. 

The Board has also considered whether separate ratings could be assigned for the Veteran's right knee disability under any other applicable diagnostic codes, but the evidence of record does not support awarding separate ratings based on a limitation of extension, a meniscal condition, ankylosis, impairment of the tibia or fibula, or genu recurvatum, as the foregoing conditions and symptoms were neither objectively documented during the examination nor described by the Veteran during the claim period.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, DCs 5003, 5256, 5261, 5262, 5263; see also VAOPGCPREC 9-04; VAOPGCPREC 23-97.  Accordingly, the claims for increased ratings for right knee instability and limitation of flexion are denied.  The evidence in this case is neither evenly nor approximately balanced.  Rather, it persuasively weighs against those claims for increased ratings.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine (38 C.F.R. § U.S.C. § 5107(b)) is therefore not for application.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

 

Left Ankle Disability

The Veteran has a 10 percent disability rating for the left ankle disability, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271.  That code defines moderate limitation of motion as less than 15 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 30 degrees plantar flexion.  A 20 percent rating as assigned for marked limitation of motion, defined as less than 5 degrees dorsiflexion or less than 10 degrees plantar flexion.  

Normal ankle dorsiflexion is to 20 degrees and normal plantar flexion is to 45 degrees.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71, Plate II.

The Veteran reported to the December 2023 VA examiner that his symptoms consisted of pain, swelling, popping and instability.  The Veteran also reported flareups of sharp pain and tightness brought on by walking and sitting for long periods of time.  The Veteran reported that he was unable to walk for long periods.  The examiner reported a history of instability of the ankle.  Range of motion was measured as plantar flexion to 30 degrees and dorsiflexion to 10 degrees on active and passive motion, with no evidence of pain.  The Veteran was able to perform repetitive use testing without any additional loss of function or range of motion.  The examiner estimated that range of motion would be reduced to plantar flexion to 25 degrees and dorsiflexion to 5 degrees with repeated use over time.  The examiner also estimated that range of motion with flareups would not be reduced.  The examiner reported no muscle atrophy and no ankylosis.  The examiner also reported that the Veteran did not have shin splints, stress fractures, achilles tendonitis, malunion of calcaneus or talus or astragalectomy.  The Veteran did not report the use of assistive devices.  

Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence does not support an evaluation higher than 10 percent.  Plantar flexion would have to be less than 10 degrees and dorsiflexion would have to be less than 5 degrees to warrant a higher rating.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5271.  Neither measurement is demonstrated in the relevant VA examination, even considering range of motion with repeated use over time and flareups.  The Board has considered the Veteran's complaints of pain, but the record reflects that he does not require assistance with ambulation and the evidence does not support significant or additional functional loss beyond that contemplated by the assigned 10 percent disability rating.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.40, 4.45, 4.59; DeLuca, 8 Vet. App. at 207.   

The Board also finds that no other diagnostic code pertaining to the left ankle would provide any higher evaluation.  There is no evidence of ankylosis, malunion of the os calcis or astragalus, or astragalectomy as contemplated by Diagnostic Codes 5270, 5272, 5273, and 5274.  38 C.F.R. § 4.71a.

Accordingly, the evidence is persuasively against the claim and there is no reasonable doubt to be resolved.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

Right Great Toe 

The Veteran has a 10 percent rating for the right great toe disability, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.71a, Diagnostic Code 5280. That code provides the rating criteria for unilateral hallux valgus, operated, with resection of the metatarsal head.  10 percent is the maximum disability rating available under this code.  

The Board notes that prior to January 5, 2023, the right great toe disability was rated pursuant to Diagnostic Coded 5010-5284.  The assignment of a particular diagnostic code depends upon the facts of each particular case, and the Board is authorized to choose an appropriate diagnostic code that is supported by both the evidence of record and a sufficiently articulated rationale.  See Butts v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 532, 538-39 (1993).  Moreover, service connection for a disability is not severed when the diagnostic code assigned to that disability is revised in order to more accurately reflect the veteran's relevant medical history, diagnoses, and demonstrated symptomatology.  See Read v. Shinseki, 651 F.3d 1296, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2011).  The Board finds that the right great toe disability is appropriately rated under Diagnostic Code 5280 because hallux valgus is documented in the record.  

The December 2023 VA examiner noted a diagnosis of hallux valgus, post-surgical.  The Veteran reported that the side of his right great toe was numb and that he had decreased range of motion.  The Veteran also reported that the toe felt tight with cramps.  The examiner reported that the Veteran did not have Morton's neuroma or metatarsalgia.  The examiner documented mild or moderate symptoms due to the hallux valgus condition.  The Veteran did not have symptoms due to hallux rigidus or claw foot or any other foot injuries or conditions.  According to the examiner, the numbness on the lateral aspect of the toe was a residual of the bunionectomy and there was only subjective pain on physical examination.  The examiner also reported that the Veteran constantly used shoe orthotics.  

As the maximum schedular rating has been assigned throughout the appeal period, a higher rating is not warranted.  In this case, the Veteran's hallux valgus is specifically listed in the rating schedule pursuant to DC 5280 and the evidence does not show he has any symptoms associated with the service-connected right great toe disability that are not contemplated by the 10 percent rating currently assigned.  The Veteran does not have any other diagnosed foot disability.     

When evaluating disabilities of the musculoskeletal system based on loss of range of motion, 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 allows for consideration of functional loss due to pain and weakness causing additional disability beyond that reflected on range of motion measurements.  DeLuca v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 202, 206-07 (1995).  Further, 38 C.F.R. § 4.45 provides that consideration also be given to weakened movement, excess fatigability, and incoordination.  As the Veteran is already in receipt of the maximum schedular rating available, consideration of 38 C.F.R. § 4.40 and § 4.45, and the accompanying case law, is not required.  Johnston v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 80 (1997).

The Board notes that a separate disability rating is not warranted for arthritis under DC 5010 as this would result in duplicate compensation for the same symptoms in violation of the anti-pyramiding provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.14, which directs that evaluation of the 'same disability' or the 'same manifestation' under various diagnoses is to be avoided.

For the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that a higher disability rating is not more nearly approximated for the Veteran's service-connected right great toe hallux valgus disability at any time during the appeal period.  The Board, therefore, concludes that the evidence substantially weighs against the claim, and it is denied.  There is no reasonable doubt to be resolved.  38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th 776.

Tension Headaches

The Veteran has an initial 10 percent disability rating for tension headaches, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.124a, Diagnostic Code 8100, effective January 5, 2023.  Under that code, a rating of 10 percent (the minimum compensable rating) requires headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks averaging one in two months over the last several months.  See id.  A 30 percent rating represents headaches with characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on average once a month over the last several months.  See id.  The maximum 50 percent disability rating is warranted for headaches with very frequent, completely prostrating, and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability.  See id. 

The Board notes that the criteria for the progressively increasing ratings for migraines are successive in nature, i.e., each level of increase in the rating requires additional criteria which must be met to warrant the increase in rating.  See Johnson v. Wilkie, 30 Vet. App. 245, 252 (2018); see also Camacho v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 360, 363-64 (2007).

The rating criteria do not define "prostrating." By way of reference, the Board notes that according to WEBSTER'S NEW WORLD DICTIONARY OF AMERICAN ENGLISH, THIRD COLLEGE EDITION (1986), page 1080, "prostration" is defined as "utter physical exhaustion or helplessness." A very similar definition is found in DORLAND'S ILLUSTRATED MEDICAL DICTIONARY 1367 (28th ed. 1994), in which "prostration" is defined as "extreme exhaustion or powerlessness." The Court has defined "prostrating" as meaning "lacking in vitality or will: powerless to rise: laid low." Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 252 (citing WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE UNABRIGED 1822 (1966)); see also Holmes v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 67, 70 (2020).

Nothing in Diagnostic Code 8100 requires that the claimant be completely unable to work in order to qualify for a 50 percent rating.  See Pierce v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 440, 446 (2004). "Productive of severe economic inadaptability" means either producing or capable of producing severe economic inadaptability.  Johnson, 30 Vet. App. at 253; Holmes, 33 Vet. App. at 70.

Additionally, the Court has held that "the Board may not deny entitlement to a higher rating on the basis of relief provided by medication when those effects are not specifically contemplated by the rating criteria."  See Jones v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 56, 63 (2012).  As Diagnostic Code 8100 does not contemplate the effects of medication in alleviating the frequency and duration of the Veteran's headaches, the Board is precluded from considering the relief afforded by the Veteran's medication, if any, in evaluating the severity of his disability.  Id.

The December 2023 VA examiner noted a diagnosis of tension headaches.  The Veteran reported that the headaches felt like pressure in his entire head and that he treated them with over-the-counter medication.  The Veteran reported that he experienced nausea and changes in vision that typically lasted less than one day.  The examiner reported that the Veteran had characteristic prostrating attacks of headache pain once in 2 months and did not have completely prostrating and prolonged attacks of headache pain.  The examiner also reported that the Veteran did not experience any other pertinent physical findings, complications, conditions, signs or symptoms related to the tension headaches.  

The evidence reflects that the tension headaches were manifested by pressure, nausea and changes in vision that lasted less than one day and occurred once in 2 months.  Based on the foregoing, a higher rating is not warranted for tension headaches as the record does not reflect that the Veteran experienced characteristic prostrating attacks occurring on average once a month over the last several months (the criteria for a 30 percent rating) or headaches with very frequent, completely prostrating, and prolonged attacks productive of severe economic inadaptability (the criteria for a 50 percent rating).  Accordingly, the claim for an increased initial rating is denied.  

The Board concludes that the evidence in this case is neither evenly nor approximately balanced.  Rather, it persuasively weighs against an increased disability rating.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine (38 U.S.C. § 5107(b)) is therefore not for application.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).

Hypertension

The Veteran has a noncompensable rating for hypertension, pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.  Under that code, a compensable rating is assignable when either of 3 criteria are satisfied: (1) when diastolic pressure is predominantly 100 or more; (2) systolic pressure is predominantly 160 or more; or (3) an individual has a history of diastolic pressure of predominantly 100 or more and requires continuous medication for control.  See id.  A 20 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressure 110 or more or; systolic pressure predominantly 200 or more.  See id.  A 40 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressure predominantly 120 or more and a 60 percent rating is assigned for diastolic pressure predominantly 130 or more.  See id.  

In McCarroll v. McDonald, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) interpreted Diagnostic Code 7101 and clarified its application in the increased rating context.  28 Vet. App. 267, 272 (2016).  The Court first stated that the criteria for compensable ratings under Diagnostic Code 7101 "contemplate two factual alternatives[:]" (1) a veteran whose blood pressure is currently controlled by medication, but who has a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, is entitled to the minimum compensable rating of 10 percent; or (2) if the blood pressure is not controlled by medication, the actual blood pressure level determines the disability rating from 20 to 60 percent.  Id.  The Court then specified that a finding of "predominantly 100 or more" may not be substantiated by merely one diastolic pressure reading of 100.  Id. at 274.

The December 2023 VA examiner noted that the treatment plan included taking continuous medication.  As the Veteran's hypertension is controlled by continuous medication, a compensable rating of 10 percent is only available if the evidence of record demonstrates a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more.  See McCarroll, 28 Vet. App. at 272; Wilson v. McDonough, 2021 WL 5997922, *8 (Vet. App. Dec. 20, 2021).  The examiner reported that the Veteran did not have a history of diastolic blood pressure elevation to predominantly 100 or more.  Blood pressure readings taken at the time of the examination were reported as 138/82, 138/78 and 136/76.  

As the record does not reflect diastolic pressure 100 or greater, the Board finds that entitlement to a compensable disability rating for hypertension is not warranted.  See 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.  The Board concludes that the evidence in this case is neither evenly nor approximately balanced.  Rather, it persuasively weighs against an increased disability rating.  The benefit of the doubt doctrine (38 U.S.C. § 5107(b)) is therefore not for application.  Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc) (only when the evidence persuasively favors one side or another is the benefit of the doubt doctrine not for application).
