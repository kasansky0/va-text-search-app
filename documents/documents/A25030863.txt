REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from November 1968 to November 1972.

This appeal comes before the Board from a November 22, 2024, rating decision of a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) which is the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ).  In a January 2025 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.  

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the November 22, 2024, AOJ decision on appeal.  38 C.F.R. § 20.301.  Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

However, because the Board is remanding the claims on appeal, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims.  38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

In February 2024, the Board remanded claims for a rating in excess of 10 percent for a low back disability; a rating in excess of 10 percent for left lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy; and entitlement to earlier effective dates for the grants of TDIU and eligibility to DEA to the AOJ for further development.  In the November 22, 2024, rating decision from which this appeal arises, the AOJ denied the claims for a rating in excess of 10 percent for a low back disability and earlier effective dates for TDIU and eligibility for DEA.  In that same decision, the AOJ granted a 20 percent rating for left lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy and also granted a 20 percent separate rating for left lower extremity femoral nerve radiculopathy, both effective April 2, 2024.  In the January 2025 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran reported appealing the rating assigned for the low back disability; the ratings assigned for left lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy both as of and prior to April 2, 2024; the initial rating assigned for the left lower extremity femoral nerve sciatic nerve radiculopathy; the effective date assigned for service connection for left lower extremity femoral nerve sciatic nerve radiculopathy; and the effective dates assigned for the grants of TDIU and eligibility to DEA.  Therefore, all of the above issues are noted as being under appeal.    

In the January 2025 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran indicated wanting to appeal the earlier effective date for the left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy disability.  However, an earlier effective date, prior to August 8, 2012, for service connection for left lower extremity sciatic radiculopathy was denied by the Board in the February 2024 decision.  Therefore, that issue is not on appeal as it has already been denied on appeal before the Board.

Moreover, although the issues were not remanded in the February 2024 Board remand, in the November 22, 2024, rating decision, the AOJ also granted a 20 percent higher rating for right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy and a 20 percent separate rating for right lower extremity femoral nerve radiculopathy, both effective April 2, 2024.  In the January 2025 Notice of Disagreement, the Veteran reported appealing the 20 percent rating assigned for right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy; the effective date assigned for a 20 percent rating for right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy; the initial rating assigned for right lower extremity femoral nerve sciatic nerve radiculopathy; and the effective date assigned for service connection for right lower extremity femoral nerve sciatic nerve radiculopathy.  Therefore, all of those issues are on appeal.

2. Entitlement to a rating in excess of 20 percent for right lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy is remanded.

11. Entitlement to an earlier effective date, prior to August 10, 2022, for eligibility for DEA is remanded.

In December 2024, the Board remanded claims for a rating in excess of 10 percent for a low back disability and a rating in excess of 10 percent for left lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy.  In the remand instructions, the Board specifically requested that the AOJ provide an examination to determine the severity of the low back and left lower extremity sciatic nerve radiculopathy disabilities.  The Board indicated that the examiner who performed the examination was to provide findings regarding any limitation of the range of motion of the thoracolumbar spine that resulted from the low back disability.  

In an April 2024 VA medical examination report, written in attempted compliance with the Board remand requests, a VA examiner reported being unable to perform any range of motion testing, because the Veteran was both unstable and a high fall risk.  The examiner stated that the Veteran could not bend, stoop, or kneel.  However, despite stating that the Veteran was unable to bend, the examiner also stated that the Veteran did not have ankylosis.  The Board notes that the fixation of a spinal segment in neutral position of 0 degrees always represents favorable ankylosis and, because an inability to bend would imply the presence of ankylosis, the examiner should have explained that finding in greater detail.  The examiner also did not explain whether the inability to bend, stoop, or kneel was due to the low back disability, the radiculopathy disabilities, or a combination of the two.  The Board notes that an inability to perform any of those activities solely due to the low back disability would imply that the disability was more severe than the currently contemplated 10 percent rating.  Considering the examiner's failure to provide probative findings regarding the low back disability that would allow for the rating of the disability, the Board finds that the examination did not meet the duty to assist the Veteran by providing an adequate examination and did not substantially comply with the Board remand requests.  Stegall v. West, 11 Vet. App. 268 (1998).  The Board notes that these were pre-decisional errors.  Therefore, remand is necessary to schedule an additional examination.  

Regarding all of the issues, the VA treatment records written prior to the end of the evidentiary period contain notations indicating that a VA employee scanned medical records into a VA hospital imaging system, but do not contain any copies of the scanned records.  Any treatment records scanned into a VA hospital's imaging system are within VA's constructive possession and are considered potentially relevant to the remaining issues on appeal.  A failure to procure these records for the claims file is pre-decisional error.  Remand is required to allow VA to obtain those records.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. Obtain the outstanding VA treatment records.  Specifically, obtain records noted as having been scanned into the Vista imaging system by VA Medical Center personnel, as noted in the VA treatment records in evidence, dated July 2, 2024; May 1, 2024; April 25, 2024; April 19, 2024; April 3, 2024; October 3, 2023; September 21, 2023; May 8, 2023; January 3, 2023; December 6, 2022; October 4, 2022; September 30, 2022; September 21, 2022; September 18, 2022; September 12, 2022; September 8, 2022; July 17, 2022; June 22, 2022; June 15, 2022; June 6, 2022; May 5, 2022; April 28, 2022; April 14, 2022; March 4, 2022; January 31, 2022; January 28, 2022; August 16, 2021; May 6, 2021; March 25, 2021; March 18, 2021; December 2, 2020; January 31, 2020; July 9, 2019; August 2, 2018; December 28, 2016; November 21, 2016; November 9, 2016; November 2, 2016; July 16, 2016; July 13, 2016; May 5, 2016; April 26, 2016; October 2, 2015; August 7, 2015; April 15, 2015; February 24, 2015; July 11, 2014; February 20, 2014; July 12, 2013; May 13, 2013; March 12, 2013; February 21, 2013; February 15, 2013; February 12, 2013; November 19, 2012; November 15, 2012; October 24, 2012; October 1, 2012; August 29, 2012; August 14, 2012; and August 13, 2012.

2. Schedule the Veteran for an examination to determine the current severity of service-connected low back and lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities.  The examiner must review the record, to particularly include the April 2024 VA medical examination report, and should note that review in their report.  The examiner should particularly note that the April 2024 VA examiner did not provide range of motion testing during the thoracolumbar spine exam, and stated that was because of the Veteran's physical instability and fears that the Veteran was a high fall risk.  The examiner should note that, although the examiner stated that the Veteran could not bend over, the examiner stated that there was no evidence of ankylosis.  The examiner should provide a full description of the disabilities, and report all signs and symptoms necessary for evaluating the low back and radiculopathy disabilities under the rating criteria.  The examiner should do the following:

(a.) If possible, all indicated tests and studies should be performed, and all clinical findings must be reported in detail.  If not possible, the examiner should explain the reasons for not being able to perform any portion of the examination.  If the Veteran is unable to perform range of motion testing, the examiner should state whether the limitation due to the back disability is the equivalent of thoracolumbar ankylosis.  

(b.) The examiner must identify the existence, and frequency or extent, as appropriate, of all neurological symptoms associated with the lumbar spine disability, to include any lower extremity radiculopathy.  Concerning any neurological findings, the examiner should state what nerves are affected and whether there is complete or incomplete paralysis of the nerve.  If incomplete paralysis is present, the examiner should provide an opinion as to whether it is mild, moderate, moderately severe, or severe, and should explain that determination.  The examiner should state whether there are sensory, motor, or strength loss manifestations. 

(c.) If possible, the examiner should test the Veteran's active motion, passive motion, and pain with weight-bearing and without weight-bearing. and provide results expressed in degrees.  The examiner should provide specific findings as to whether there is objective evidence of pain on motion, weakened motion, excess motion, fatigability, or incoordination.  If pain on motion is observed, the examiner should indicate the point at which pain begins.  If range of motion testing is not possible, the examiner should provide estimates in degrees of the impairment based on the other evidence of record and the Veteran's statements.  If it is not possible to provide a specific measurement, the examiner should explain why.  

(d.) If testing is possible, the examiner should indicate whether, and to what extent, the Veteran experiences functional loss of the thoracolumbar spine due to pain or any of the other symptoms during flare-ups or with repeated use.  

(e.) If muscle spasm or guarding of the thoracolumbar spine is present, the examiner should state whether it is severe enough to result in an abnormal gait or abnormal spinal contour such as scoliosis, reversed lordosis, or abnormal kyphosis. 

(f.) The examiner should comment as to the existence and frequency of any incapacitating episodes of intervertebral disc syndrome.  If the Veteran has incapacitating episodes of intervertebral disc syndrome associated with the lumbar spine disability, the examiner should specify the frequency and duration.  An incapacitating episode is a period of acute signs and symptoms due to intervertebral disc syndrome that requires bed rest prescribed by a physician and treatment by a physician.

(g.) The examiner should state whether or not there is any ankylosis, or fixation of a spinal segment of the spine.  If testing is not possible, but the Veteran is not able to bend the spine, the examiner should indicate whether that inability is not equivalent to ankylosis.

(h.) If the examiner finds that the Veteran is unable to bend, stoop, or walk, the examiner should indicate whether it is possible to differentiate whether the inability to perform any of those tasks was due to the low back disability, the lower extremity radiculopathy disabilities, or a combination of those disabilities.
