DOCKET NO. 240508-438629
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

An effective date of July 28, 2022, but no earlier, for the grant of service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The date of claim is July 28, 2022, for the claim of entitlement to service connection for PTSD; the claim was continuously pursued until granted by timely filing of an available review option; and July 28, 2022, is the later of date of claim and date entitlement arose.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of July 28, 2022, for the grant of service connection for PTSD are met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400; 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), (h).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from February 1980 to November 1985.

In August 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of entitlement to service connection for PTSD most recently addressed in a June 2023 rating decision. In January 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which granted entitlement to service connection for PTSD based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision.

In May 2024, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) received VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, wherein the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the January 2024 rating decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted after that rating decision, the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.302(a), 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

Effective Dates

Generally, the effective date of an award of disability compensation based on an original claim shall be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. Unless otherwise provided, the effective date of compensation will be fixed in accordance with the facts found, but will not be earlier than the date of receipt of the claimant's application. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). If a claim is filed within one year after separation from service, service connection will be effective as of the day after separation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(b)(2).

Additionally, under the AMA, the effective date will be fixed in accordance with the date of receipt of the initial claim or date entitlement arose, whichever is later, if a claimant continuously pursues an issue by timely filing in succession any of the available review options as specified in paragraph (c) of this section within one year of the issuance of the decision. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(h). Continuously pursuing a claim occurs where, after notice of a decision on an initial or supplemental claim, the Veteran files a supplemental claim, requests a higher-level review, or appeals to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, or after notice of a decision on a higher-level review, the Veteran files a supplemental claim or appeals to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c).

Entitlement to an effective date prior to August 17, 2023, for the ward of service connection for PTSD.

A January 2024 rating decision granted service connection for PTSD, effective August 17, 2023-the date of receipt of the supplemental claim. See Rating Decision (January 2024). This appeal arises from the Veteran's disagreement with the January 2024 effective date of the grant of service connection for PTSD. See VA Form 10182 (May 2024) (requests an effective date of July 28, 2022, for the grant of service connection for PTSD).

The Board concludes that the criteria for an effective date of July 28, 2022, but no earlier, based on continuous prosecution of the claim, are met. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.400, 3.2500.

First, the relevant date of claim is July 28, 2022. The Veteran does not contend nor does the record show an earlier claim for psychiatric disability. Here, the record shows that VA received on July 28, 2022, the Veteran's VA 21-526EZ, for service connection for PTSD. See VA 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim (July 2022). A June 2023 rating decision denied the claim. See Rating Decision (June 2023). Next, in August 2023, within one year of that June 2023 adverse rating decision, VA received the Veteran's VA Form 20-0995 seeking review of the June 2023 decision that denied the claim for PTSD. See VA Form 20-0995 Supplemental Claim Application (August 2023). A January 2024 rating decision granted service connection for PTSD. Although the supplemental claim was received August 17, 2023, the AMA permits an earlier effective date based on continuous pursuit-that is filing an available review option within one year of the decision until granted. Thus, as the evidence established that the Veteran continuously pursued the claim since her original claim for July 28, 2022, this is the date of claim. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(c), (h).

Second, the record reflect that entitlement arose prior to July 28, 2022 for service connection for PTSD and based on military sexual trauma (MST). Prior to this date the Veteran had a stressor and there was a private psychological examination diagnosing PTSD linked to trauma while service in the military. The diagnosis was subsequently confirmed on the VA-obtained September 2023 PTSD examination.

Accordingly, the claim is granted for an effective date of July 28, 2022, for the grant of service connection for PTSD.
