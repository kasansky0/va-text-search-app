DOCKET NO. 220321-230023
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

The appeal concerning the Veteran's character of discharge is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

On June 29, 2022, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran, through his authorized representative, that a withdrawal of this appeal is requested.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran, through his authorized representative, have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty with the United States Marine Corps from May 2015 to August 2021.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals on appeal from an October 2021 administrative decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) in this matter. 

In the March 2022 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Hearing docket.  However, in June 2022, the Veteran, through his representative, submitted a written statement requesting to withdraw his appeal.

The Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination being appealed.  38 U.S.C. § 7105.  An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by the appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  Id.  Here, the Veteran's withdrawal, submitted by his authorized representative, was in writing and included his name, applicable VA file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn.  As the Veteran has withdrawn this appeal, there remain no allegations of errors of fact or law for appellate consideration.  Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the appeal, and it is dismissed.
