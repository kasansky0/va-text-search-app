DOCKET NO. 230411-337790
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

An initial compensable evaluation for allergic rhinitis prior to February 2, 2023, is denied.

FINDING OF FACT

Prior to February 2, 2023, the persuasive evidence shows that the Veteran's allergic rhinitis is manifested by no polyps, less than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides, and less than complete obstruction on one side.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

Prior to February 2, 2023, the criteria for an initial compensable rating for allergic rhinitis have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1, 4.3, 4.7, 4.31, 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6522.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1984 to March 1992. The Veteran was awarded the Army Achievement Medal and the Southwest Asia Service Medal, among other decorations.

In February 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a February 2022 decision.  In March 2023, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the HLR decision on appeal, which considered the evidence of record at the time of the prior February 2022 decision.  

In the April 2023 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2022 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. If evidence was submitted during the period after the AOJ issued the decision, which was subsequently subject to higher-level review the Board did not consider it in its decision. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

The Board notes that on February 2, 2023, the Veteran filed a new increased rating claim for allergic rhinitis. In a March 13, 2023 rating decision, the AOJ increased the disability evaluation for allergic rhinitis to 10 percent, effective February 2, 2023. Therefore, the Board has recharacterized the claim as noted on the title page.

Increased Rating

Disability evaluations are determined by the application of a schedule of ratings, which is based on average impairment of earning capacity caused by the given disability. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4.

Where entitlement to compensation has already been established and an increase in the disability rating is at issue, the present level of disability is of primary importance. Francisco v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 55, 58 (1994). However, when an appeal is based on the assignment of an initial rating for a disability, following an initial award of service connection for this disability, the rule articulated in Francisco does not apply. Fenderson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 119 (1999). In any claim for an increased rating, "staged" ratings may be warranted where the factual findings show distinct time periods when the service-connected disability exhibits symptoms that would warrant different ratings. Hart v. Mansfield, 21 Vet. App. 505 (2007).

If the disability more closely approximates the criteria for the higher of two ratings, the higher rating will be assigned; otherwise, the lower rating is assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7. It is not expected that all cases will show all the findings specified; however, findings sufficiently characteristic to identify the disease and the disability therefrom and coordination of rating with impairment of function will be expected in all instances. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21.

1. Entitlement to an initial compensable evaluation for allergic rhinitis prior to February 2, 2023.

The Veteran contends that his service connected allergic rhinitis warrants a compensable rating. 

The Veteran's service connected rhinitis is currently rated under DC 6522. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97.

Diagnostic Code 6522 does not provide for a noncompensable rating. However, in every instance where the schedule does not provide a zero percent evaluation for a diagnostic code, a zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31.

Under DC 6522, a 10 percent rating is assigned for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis without polyps, but with greater than 50 percent obstruction of nasal passage on both sides or complete obstruction on one side. The highest rating of 30 percent is assigned for allergic or vasomotor rhinitis with polyps. 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, DC 6522.

In November 2021, the Veteran wrote that his current allergic rhinitis symptoms included coughing, headaches, and thick mucus, which cause difficulty breathing. See November 2021 VA 21-4138 Statement.

The Veteran underwent a VA Sinusitis/Rhinitis examination in December 2021. The examiner confirmed a diagnosis of rhinitis. The Veteran endorsed current symptoms of congestion, burning and itching eyes, and runny nose that he treated with over the counter medicine such as Sudafed, Loratadine, Flonase, and Mucinex. On physical examination, the examiner found that the Veteran does not have polyps or granulomatous conditions. Additionally, there was less than 50 percent obstruction of the nasal passage on both sides, less than complete obstruction on either side, and no permanent hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates. 

VA treatment records for the period on appeal reflect the Veteran's use of Loratadine and Flonase nasal spray for seasonal allergies. See CAPRI November 2, 2021.

The Board finds that an initial compensable evaluation prior to February 2, 2023 is not warranted for rhinitis under DC 6522. The current criteria of Diagnostic Code 6522 allow for consideration of factors that may be indicative of allergic or vasomotor rhinitis with or without polyps.  However, neither the Veteran's post-service treatment records nor VA examination report document any diagnosis for polyps or significant nasal obstruction or blockage of the nasal passages.  No other impairment related to allergic rhinitis has been identified. The Board acknowledges the Veteran's report of coughing, headaches, and thick mucus that cause difficulty breathing. While the Veteran has indicated sinusitis-related symptoms, he is service-connected for this condition. The medical evidence does not reveal any symptoms uniquely addressable under rating codes other than that indicated in the above-listed rating criteria. 

In sum, the overall evidence does not show that the Veteran's symptoms have resulted in additional functional limitation (50 percent obstruction of both nasal passages or complete obstruction of one nasal passage) such as to enable a finding that the disability picture more nearly approximates a compensable disability rating for the any part of the rating period on appeal. Also, because allergic rhinitis is specifically listed in the rating schedule, it may not be rated by analogy under a different DC. Copeland v. McDonald, 27 Vet. App. 333, 337 (2015). Therefore, no other DCs are potentially applicable which might provide a compensable rating on an alternative basis.

For the above reasons, the evidence persuasively weighs against entitlement to a compensable rating for allergic rhinitis. As the evidence is neither evenly balanced nor approximate, the benefit of the doubt doctrine does not apply. Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc). The claim is denied.
