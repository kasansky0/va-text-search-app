ORDER

Entitlement to service connection cardiovascular disease is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Veteran's cardiovascular disease is related to in-service exposure to herbicide agents in Vietnam.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for service connection for cardiovascular disease are met.  38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 1112, 1113, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from February 1966 to December 1968.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a rating decision issued by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Agency of Original Jurisdiction.  

Entitlement to service connection cardiovascular disease 

The Veteran contends that his diagnosed cardiovascular disease was the result of herbicide agent exposure while in Vietnam.

Service connection will be granted for a current disability that resulted from an injury, disease, or aggravation while in active service. 38 U.S.C. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a). Generally, service connection requires (1) a present disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury, and (3) a nexus between the present disability and the in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury. See Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

VA will presume the diseases listed in 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(2) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e) are related to service if they become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more at any time after service and the herbicide agent exposure was during active service in the Republic of Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975. 38 U.S.C. § 1116; 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(ii). Coronary artery disease (CAD) is listed in 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(2)(G) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).  To this end, toxic exposure risk activity (TERA) has been conceded by the VA, to include exposure to herbicides. 

When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57-58 (1990); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in August 2023 to assess the nature and etiology of his claimed cardiovascular disability.  Upon examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with implanted cardiac pacemaker and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Upon consideration of the type, frequency, and intensity of his conceded herbicide exposure, the VA examiner found that such cardiovascular conditions were as likely as not, due to the Veteran's active service exposure to herbicides. 

Collaborating such finding, the Veteran submitted an opinion letter from his private physician.  In a January 2024 opinion letter, Dr. K. Z., found that based on the Veteran's cardiovascular conditions, and the lack of any reported genetic disposition for heart disease, concluded that the Veteran's conditions were due to his exposure to herbicides during his active service. 

Accordingly, the Board finds that the competent medical evidence of record to be in favor of the Veteran's claim for service connection for a cardiovascular condition. While there are other opinions of record that weigh against the claim, such are not more probative than the favorable evidence of record. Instead, the evidence is in approximate balance as to whether the claimed disorder is related to the Veteran's military service, to include in-service exposure. Therefore, reasonable doubt is resolved in favor of the Veteran, and service connection for a cardiovascular condition based on herbicide agent exposure is warranted. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; 38 C.F.R. § 3.102. The claim is granted.
