DOCKET NO. 211001-188026
DATE: April 3, 2025

ORDER

An effective date of August 6, 2015, for the award of service connection for Meniere's disease is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

The Veteran filed an Intent to File a Claim for Compensation on August 6, 2015, followed by a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, for Meniere's disease.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for an effective date of August 6, 2015, for the award of service connection for Meniere's disease, are met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 5107, 5110, 5121; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.151, 3.155, 3.160, 3.400.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty from May 1989 to February 2012.

In February 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR), and requested review of a January 2021 rating decision.  Although the Veteran initially requested Higher-Level Review when submitting the February 2021 VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: HLR, the Higher-Level Reviewer determined that there had been a duty to assist error and transferred the claim to the supplemental claim decision review option for additional development.  

The supplemental claim decision was issued in June 2021.  In the October 2021 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the direct review docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the June 2021 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

The Board notes that although the Veteran elected the direct review docket, he submitted evidence with his October 2021 Notice of Disagreement.  As such, the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) sent the Veteran correspondence in February 2025 requesting for him to respond and indicate whether he intends his appeal to be processed under the direct review docket or the evidence submission docket.  The Veteran was advised that if he did not respond, his appeal would be dismissed.  38 C.F.R. § 20.202(f)-(g).  In February 2025, the Veteran responded that he wants his appeal to be processed under the direct review docket and that he understands that any additional evidence submitted with his October 2021 Notice of Disagreement would not be considered. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a supplemental claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a supplemental claim are included with this decision. 

Law and Regulations

The Veteran contends that he should be granted an earlier effective date than March 27, 2020, for the award of service connection for his Meniere's disease.  He specifically contends that he should be awarded an effective date of August 6, 2015, from the date of a claim he states he has continuously pursued.

In general, the effective date of an evaluation and award of compensation based on an original claim, a claim reopened after final disallowance, or a claim for increase will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400.

Effective March 24, 2015, VA amended its regulations to require that all claims governed by VA's adjudication regulations be filed on a standard form. The amendments also, inter alia, eliminate the constructive receipt of VA reports of hospitalization or examination and other medical records as informal claims to reopen. See 79 Fed. Reg. 57,660 (Sept. 25, 2014), codified as amended at 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.151, 3.155 (2016). The amended regulations, however, apply only to claims filed on or after March 24, 2015. 

In some cases, a report of examination or hospitalization may be accepted as an informal claim for benefits. 38 C.F.R. § 3.157(b) (2014). The date of outpatient or hospital examination or date of admission to a VA hospital will be accepted as the date of receipt of a claim when such reports relate to examination or treatment of a disability for which service connection has previously been established or when a claim specifying the benefit sought is received within one year from the date of such examination, treatment, or hospital admission. 38 C.F.R. § 3.157(b) (2014).

Generally, the effective date of an award based on an original claim shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(a). However, an effective date for increased disability compensation may be earlier than the date of receipt of the application. In such cases, the effective date shall be the earliest date as of which it is factually ascertainable that an increase in disability had occurred, if a claim is received within one year from such date. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o)(2). If the increase occurred more than one year prior to the claim, the increase is effective the date of claim; if the increase occurred after the date of claim, the effective date is the date of increase. 38 U.S.C. § 5110(b)(2); Harper v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 125 (1997); 38 C.F.R. § 3.400(o). "An effective date earlier than the date of claim may be assigned if an increase in disability is shown within the one-year ("look-back") period prior to the receipt of a claim, but not where the increase is shown prior to the one-year period preceding the receipt of the claim." See Gaston v. Shinseki, 605 F.3d 979, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

Analysis

The Veteran originally filed a claim for vertigo in December 2011, which was denied by the AOJ in April 2013.  He was notified of the denial and his appellate rights in an April 2013 letter. He did not appeal this decision, and no relevant evidence was constructively or physically associated with the claims file within one year of this decision. Thus, the Board finds that this decision is final.

In August 2015, VA received an Intent to File, followed by a VA Form 21-526EZ, Fully Developed Claim, for Meniere's disease in June 2016.  This was denied by the AOJ in an October 2016 rating decision.  The Veteran filed a Notice of Disagreement under the Legacy appeals system in May 2017 and a Statement of the Case was issued January 2020.  In March 2020, the Veteran filed a supplemental claim and opted his appeal into the modernized review system.  In a January 2021 decision, the AOJ awarded service connection for Meniere's disease and combined it with tinnitus for an evaluation of 100 percent from March 27, 2020.  In February 2021, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: (HLR), requesting an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for Meniere's disease.  In May 2021, the AOJ found that a duty to assist error had been identified regarding the Veteran's claim for Meniere's disease and noted that further development was needed in this case.  In June 2021, the AOJ issued a decision denying an earlier effective date for the award of service connection for Meniere's disease (and tinnitus).  The Veteran appealed this decision to the Board.

In order to award an earlier effective date, the Veteran must have filed a claim for service connection for his Meniere's disease prior to August 2015, which remained pending as of the August 2015 filing. 38 U.S.C. § 5110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. The Board has thoroughly reviewed the evidence of record to determine if the Veteran filed a claim, an informal claim, or expressed a written intent to file a claim for service connection for Meniere's disease after the April 2013 final denial and prior to August 2015.

The Board notes that even if medical records related to Meniere's disease were associated with the claim prior to August 2015, such records cannot constitute an informal claim under 38 C.F.R. § 3.155, because treatment records alone do not indicate an intent to apply for service connection benefits.  38 C.F.R. § 3.155(a).  Although 38 C.F.R. § 3.157(a) provides for a report of examination or hospitalization by VA to be accepted as an informal claim for benefits (without any indication of intent to apply for benefits) in certain instances, none of these instances are applicable here.  As previously mentioned, the mere mention of a condition in a medical record alone cannot be construed as a claim for service connection.  See MacPhee v. Nicholson, 459 F.3d 1323, 1326-27 (Fed. Cir. 2006).  

After the April 2013 final decision and prior to August 2015, there is no communication from the Veteran indicating that he wished to seek service connection, or which expressed a belief that VA had not fully developed a claim for service connection regarding Meniere's disease. 

Having determined that the Veteran's most recent claim following a prior final denial was filed in August 2015, the Board must now determine when entitlement to service connection arose. As noted above, an effective date is assigned based on the date of the receipt of a claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later. 38 C.F.R. § 3.400. 

The evidence of record contains conflicting evidence regarding the onset of Meniere's disease in this case.  At an April 2013 VA ear conditions examination, the examiner found no objective evidence of vertigo.  A diagnosis of Meniere's disease was not found at this examination.  VA treatment records from February 2016 indicate a medical history of Meniere's disease, and in March 2016, the Veteran was noted to have Meniere's disease.  In July 2016, the Veteran was noted to have increasing headaches, vertigo, and dizziness.  He was noted to have possible Meniere's, with a triad of decreased hearing, dizziness, and ringing of the ears.  The onset was unknown.  A VA treatment record from the following month included a "past medical history" of Meniere's disease, hearing loss, tinnitus, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. In an October 2016 VA ear conditions examination, a VA examiner found that the evidence did not support a diagnosis for Meniere's disease.  The examiner noted that the Veteran's problem list showed a diagnosis for Meniere's disease, but an audiology examination one month prior showed no hearing loss.  In September 2019, the Veteran endorsed increased vertigo.  He reportedly was treated by an audiologist who found that he had decreased hearing and recommended him to follow up.  It was noted that a diagnosis of Meniere's disease was highly suspected.  Private treatment records from March 31, 2020, show a diagnosis for Meniere's disease of the left ear.  At a December 2020 VA ear conditions examination, the VA examiner noted a diagnosis for Meniere's disease, with the date of diagnosis found to be March 31, 2020.

In a June 2021 VA medical opinion, a VA examiner noted the Veteran's reports of vertigo in service but stated that he was diagnosed with vertigo and his hearing was normal.  There was no evidence of continuation of symptoms.  Thus, the examiner found that the transient vertigo symptoms had resolved.  The examiner noted that vertigo is a symptom and not a diagnosis.  He added that a hearing examination in October 2015 showed normal hearing and "the Veteran denied characteristic symptoms of Meniere's disease," noting that "Meniere's disease cannot be diagnosed without hearing loss."  Thus, Meniere's disease was not found within one year of the Veteran's separation from service.  The VA examiner addressed the July 2016 VA treatment records indicating that the Veteran had Meniere's disease but noted that this was based on the Veteran's own reported history and was a "working diagnosis."  He added that a working diagnosis is one that has not yet been confirmed, because there needs to be a medical conclusion after investigation and analysis.  The Veteran was referred to neurology at the time and was not diagnosed with Meniere's based on a July 2016 neurology note.  In October 2016, the Veteran had right ear hearing loss that was not considered hearing loss for VA purposes, but left ear hearing was normal.  In April 2019, the Veteran was diagnosed with BPPV, which the VA examiner noted is distinct from Meniere's disease.  As the Veteran was found to have Meniere's disease at an ENT visit on March 31, 2020, with no active BPPV, the VA examiner concluded that the evidence as a whole was against a diagnosis for Meniere's disease prior to March 31, 2020. 

Based on the above, the Board finds that there is conflicting evidence on when the Veteran's disability onset. The Veteran reported that his private healthcare provider diagnosed him with Meniere's disease prior to filing his claim, and he is competent to report what he was told by his physician. VA treatment records included this diagnosis, apparently without question, and while there was some later debate on whether the initial diagnosis was correct, VA eventually agreed and a diagnosis of Meniere's was rendered.  After resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the disability has persisted throughout the claim.

In this case, the Veteran filed an Intent to File a Claim on August 6, 2015, followed by a claim for Meniere's disease in June 2016.  The Veteran continuously pursued this claim until service connection was granted.  Accordingly, the Board finds that an effective date of August 6, 2015, but not earlier, is warranted for the award of service connection for Meniere's disease.  38 C.F.R. § 3.400.
