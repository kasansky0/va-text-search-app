FINDING OF FACT

On February 18, 2025, prior to the promulgation of a decision in the appeal, the Board received notification from the Veteran that he wished to withdraw his appeal as to the issues listed in the May 20, 2024, VA Form 10182 Notice of Disagreement.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for withdrawal of an appeal by the Veteran have been met.  38 U.S.C. § 7105; 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Air Force from August 1976 to December 1980, and from February 1981 to April 1997.

In November 2023, March 2024, and April 2024 Rating Decisions by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), the Veteran's claims for service connection of a bilateral hand condition and increased ratings for allergic rhinitis and bilateral lower extremity peripheral neuritis were denied.  In a May 20, 2024, VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal, the Veteran expressed disagreement with the denials and elected the Direct Review docket.

Withdrawal of Appeal

An appeal may be withdrawn in writing at any time before the Board promulgates a decision.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Withdrawal may be made by a veteran, appellant or by his or her authorized representative.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205.  Except for appeals withdrawn on the record at a hearing, appeal withdrawals must be in writing and meet certain requirements set forth by regulation.  Specifically, they must include the name of the veteran or appellant, the applicable file number, and a statement that the appeal is being withdrawn.  38 C.F.R. § 20.205(b)(1).

In February 18, 2025, correspondence, the Veteran represented that he wished to withdraw the appeal filed May 20, 2024, relating to the above-captioned claims.  The correspondence included the Veteran's identifying information, appeal docket number, and a clear statement that the appeal was being withdrawn.  The Board finds that the Veteran's withdrawal was explicit, unambiguous, and done with a full understanding of the consequences of such action.  See Hembree v. Wilkie, 33 Vet. App. 1, 7 (2020) (when written withdrawal of an appeal under 38 C.F.R. § 20.204 complies with regulatory requirements, it is effective immediately); see also Acree v. O'Rourke, 891 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2018).  The Board, therefore, finds that the Veteran's request to withdraw the appeal of the above captioned claims qualifies as a valid withdrawal.  See 38 C.F.R. § 20.205.

Accordingly, as there remain no allegations of error of fact or law for appellate consideration, the appeals are dismissed.
