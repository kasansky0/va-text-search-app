REMANDED

Entitlement to an increased rating for lung cancer residuals is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty in the Navy from November 1968 to November 1993, including service in Vietnam.

This appeal has been advanced on the Board's docket pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 7107(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 20.900(c).

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a December 2021 rating decision issued by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which reduced the Veteran's rating for service connected lung cancer from 100 percent to 0 percent disabling effective March 1, 2022.  The Veteran submitted his VA Form 20-0996 Request for Higher-Level Review in December 2022.  In a March 2023 rating decision, the AOJ found a duty to assist error, and a subsequent VA examination was conducted.  In a February 2024 higher level review rating decision, the AOJ continued the 0 percent evaluation of lung cancer. 

In the December 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran selected the Evidence Submission docket.  Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 higher level rating decision (as additional development took place following the March 2023 rating decision), as well as any evidence submitted by the Veteran or his representative with, or within 90 days from receipt of, the VA Form 10182. 38 C.F.R. § 20.303.  If evidence was submitted either (1) during the period after the AOJ issued the February 2024 higher level rating decision and prior to receipt of the VA Form 10182, or (2) more than 90 days following receipt of the VA Form 10182, the Board did not consider it in its decision.  38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.303, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence.  38 C.F.R. § 3.2501.  If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim[s], considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered.  Id.  Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision. 

Entitlement to an increased rating for lung cancer residuals is remanded.

The Veteran's representative argues that the Veteran's breathing capacity is worse post lung cancer.  The Veteran's representative requested remand to evaluate the Veteran for a worsened condition after his cancer/cancer treatment as confirmed by his pulmonary function tests (PFTs).

By way of history, the Veteran's lung cancer was rated as 100 percent disabling under Diagnostic Code (DC) 6819 from January 16, 2020, and rated as 0 percent disabling under DC 6819 from March 1, 2022.  See February 2024 Rating Decision - Codesheet. 

Under Diagnostic Code 6819 a rating of 100 percent continues beyond the cessation of any surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic chemotherapy or other therapeutic procedure.  Six months after the discontinuance of such treatment, the appropriate disability rating is determined by mandatory VA examination.  If there has been no local reoccurrence or metastases, the rating is based on residuals.

Initially, the Board notes that the claim at issue is not a formal reduction under the substantive provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.343 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.344 because the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6819 contain a temporal element for continuance of a 100 percent rating.  Therefore, the AOJ's action was not a "rating reduction" as that term is commonly understood.  See Rossiello v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 430 (1992).  Here, the Board must only determine whether the AOJ adhered to the procedural requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e), and if the reduction was by operation of law under Diagnostic Code 6819.  Any error in evaluating the residuals does not render the reduction itself improper and does not warrant reversal and reinstatement of the prior 100 percent evaluation.  See Rossiello, 3 Vet. App. at 433.

With regard to the issue of the effective date of the reduction, it appears that the AOJ complied with the procedural requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e).  The reduction was made effective no sooner than permitted by current law and regulations ("the last day of the month in which a 60-day period from the date of notice to the beneficiary of the final action expires").  38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e). Specifically, the Veteran was notified of the proposed reduction in a June 2021 rating decision.  In the December 2021 rating decision, the Veteran was notified that the evaluation was decreased to 0 percent, effective March 1, 2022.  The effective date is proper.

Moreover, as noted above, the Court held in Rossiello that the cessation of a 100 percent cancer rating under DC 6819 was not a traditional rating reduction because of the Diagnostic Code's Note automatically terminating temporal requirement.  3 Vet. App. 430 (Vet. App. 1992).  Additionally, in a more recent case Foster v. McDonough, the Court found that it was clear from the plain language of Diagnostic Code 7528 that the discontinuance of an Appellant's 100 percent rating does not constitute a traditional rating reduction but is instead part of the initial rating assigned for the condition.  34 Vet. App. 338 (2021), see also Love v. McDonough, 106 F.4th 1361 (2024).  The Board acknowledges that the Court in Foster and the Federal Circuit in Love were adjudicating Diagnostic Code 7528, but the Board finds that the language of that regulation is nearly identical to the language contained in Diagnostic Code 6819, the Diagnostic Code at issue, which makes those holdings persuasive in this case.  Accordingly, the Board finds that because the 100 percent evaluation awarded under Diagnostic Code 6819's Note contains an automatically terminating temporal requirement, this is not a traditional reduction, and 38 C.F.R. § 3.105(e) has been substantially complied with in this case. 

In June 2021, the Veteran was scheduled for a VA examination to assess the current nature and severity of his condition more than six months after discontinuance of his treatment, as required by 38 C.F.R. § 4.97, Diagnostic Code 6819.  Based on the June 2021 VA medical opinion, the Veteran's malignant neoplasm was determined to be in remission, and the 100 percent rating ceased by operation of law.  As the Veteran's lung cancer was determined by examination to be in remission more than 6 months after cessation of treatment in May 2020, the Board finds that the 100 percent rating under Diagnostic Code 6819 was properly reduced effective March 1, 2022. 

Moving next to the Veteran's increased rating claim, the Board finds that remand is required.

In addition to lung cancer, the Veteran has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), eosinophilic asthma, Barrett esophagus, and dyspnea.  See December 2022 CAPRI.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in conjunction for his claim for an increased rating for lung cancer residuals in May 2023.  The VA examiner noted the Veteran was diagnosed with COPD in May 2023 and benign or malignant neoplasm or metastases of the respiratory system in February 2019.  No other diagnoses were shown regarding the Veteran's respiratory system, despite the Veteran's VA medical records showing a history of eosinophilic asthma, Barrett esophagus, and dyspnea.  The Veteran was noted as having malignant neoplasms in remission and the examiner found that the Veteran did not have any residual conditions or complications due to the neoplasm or its treatment.  The Veteran was noted as having multiple respiratory conditions and the Veteran's COPD was listed as the condition primarily responsible for the limitation in pulmonary function.  In the opinion section of the examination, the examiner stated,

The claimed condition was less likely than not aggravated beyond its natural progression by the veteran's service connected condition.  Rationale is [t]he veteran has an [extensive] Hx of alcohol use and cigarette smoking (50 pack years based on medical record)  He was diagnosed with COPD in about 2015 or 2016 and has been treated with inhalational therapy.  In 2019 he was [discovered] to have a small lung cancer [successfully] treated with radiation with no sign of recurrence.  His pulmonary function test (PFT) post radiation was about the same as pre treatment with an FEV 1 of 45 %.  His current FEV 1 is 33 % which is probably not accurate based on his level of activity and the lack of daytime O2.  He has remained in stage 3 of COPD.  The veteran has smoking induced COPD and lung cancer.  The COPD is a condition which will [deteriorate] over time and has not been aggravated by his recent treatment for lung Cancer.  See May 2023 C&P Exam.  

The VA examiner did not note the Veteran's eosinophilic asthma, Barrett esophagus, and dyspnea at all in their evaluation of the Veteran and did not note how these conditions may have affected the Veteran's PFT.  Additionally, the examiner offered an inadequate reasoning as to why the Veteran's PFT results had deteriorated after his lung cancer, while noting that the Veteran had remained in stage 3 of COPD.  Therefore, remand is required to accurately assess the Veteran's potential lung cancer residuals, taking into account all the Veteran's pulmonary conditions. 

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1.  Schedule the Veteran for an examination with an appropriate clinician to determine the current severity of his respiratory disability.  The examiner should review the full claims file and conduct all appropriate tests.  If any standard test cannot be performed, or is medically contraindicated, the examiner must explain why.

2. The clinician should provide an explanation as to why the Veteran's PFT results had deteriorated after the Veteran's lung cancer. 

3.  If residuals of lung cancer are found, the Veteran's residuals of lung cancer should be rated under any applicable Diagnostic Code, to include DC 6844. 

A complete and fully explanatory rationale must be provided for any opinion offered, citing any record evidence or medical literature relied upon.  The opinion must consider all relevant evidence of record, including lay testimony.  If an opinion cannot be rendered without resorting to speculation, the examiner must explain why.
