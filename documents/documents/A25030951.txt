ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity varicose veins is dismissed.

FINDING OF FACT

At the time the Veteran filed the June 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), there was already a pending higher-level review of the issue of entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity varicose veins.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for dismissal of the appeal for entitlement to service connection for bilateral lower extremity varicose veins have been met. 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from August 2013 to August 2017.

This matter comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from January and December 2023 rating decisions by a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO), which is the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ). The modernized review system, known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

Unfortunately, the Veteran's appeal must be dismissed because it was an improper concurrent election under the AMA. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b).

Under the AMA, a claimant may elect administrative review of an AOJ decision by requesting one of three review options, or lanes: (i) higher-level review by the AOJ; (ii) supplemental claim; or (iii) appeal to the Board (by a notice of disagreement). See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(1). Once a claimant has filed for review under one of these options, they may not choose another lane of review with respect to the same claim or same issue contained within the claim until the higher-level review, supplemental claim, or notice of disagreement is adjudicated; or until the request for higher-level review, supplemental claim, or notice of disagreement is withdrawn. See 38 U.S.C. § 5104C(a)(2)(A); 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(b). In other words, concurrent election, or electing multiple review options simultaneously for the same claim, is prohibited. Id. A claimant may change the review option selected by withdrawing the original request and filing the appropriate application for the requested review option within one year from the date on which VA issued notice of a decision on an issue. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2500(e)(1).

Here, the AOJ issued a January 2023 rating decision denying service connection for varicose veins. In August 2023, the Veteran filed VA Form 20-0996 Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (HLR) seeking HLR of the January 2023 rating decision. In the December 2023 rating decision, the AOJ stated that it had identified a duty to assist error during HLR and that it would further develop the Veteran's claim, including to obtain certain federal records and develop for a Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) memorandum with a possible medical opinion. 

While this additional development was being conducted, and prior to the final adjudication of the Veteran's HLR request in July 2024, VA received the Veteran's June 2024 VA Form 10182 (Notice of Disagreement) in which the Veteran listed the January and December 2023 rating decisions as the decisions he was appealing. There is no indication in the record that the Veteran attempted to withdraw his August 2023 HLR request.

The Board notes that the December 2023 AOJ decision on HLR that the Veteran cited in the June 2023 VA Form 10182 was not a final decision that was ripe for appeal. Rather, in the December 2023 decision, the AOJ identified a duty to assist error during the HLR of the January 2023 rating decision and was going to conduct additional development prior to a final adjudication. See Shipley v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 458, 461-62 (2011) (finding that a deferred decision does not constitute an adjudicative decision for which a notice of disagreement may be filed because it is not a final decision).

The Board also notes that the Veteran has a separately pending AMA appeal based on an August 2024 VA Form 10182, which will be adjudicated by the Board in a separate decision.

Accordingly, the Board does not have jurisdiction to review this appeal, and it is dismissed.

As a final matter, the Board notes that in the June 2024 VA Form 10182, the Veteran also checked the box that he was "appealing a denial of benefits by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)." However, nothing in the record, including in the Veteran's statement on the VA Form 10182, otherwise evidences a claim for VHA benefits. Thus, the Board construes the June 2024 VA Form 10182 as appealing the 2023 rating decisions for varicose veins and not a claim for VHA benefits. This does not prejudice the Veteran with respect to any claim he may have for VHA benefits.
