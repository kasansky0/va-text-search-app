ORDER

1. Entitlement to service connection for a left knee condition is denied.

2. Entitlement to service connection for a right knee condition is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran does not have a current diagnosis for a left knee condition.

2. The Veteran's right knee condition is not related to service. 

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for service connection for a left knee condition have not been met. 38 C.F.R. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303.

2. The criteria for service connection for a right knee condition have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.304, 3.655.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army August 2015 to June 2018.

This matter comes to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from an October 2023 rating decision of a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO). 

In an April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran requested the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the October 2023 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801.

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claim, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board has limited the discussion below to the relevant evidence required to support its finding of fact and conclusion of law, as well as to the specific contentions regarding the case as raised directly by the Veteran and those reasonably raised by the record. See Scott v. McDonald, 789 F.3d 1375, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2015); Robinson v. Peake, 21 Vet. App. 545, 552 (2008).

Last, the Board notes that on the June 2023 claim VA 21-526EZ, the Veteran indicated homelessness. A motion to advance the case on the docket (AOD) may be granted if, among other factors, the Veteran is seriously ill, or under severe financial hardship. 38 U.S.C. § 7107 (a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 20.900 (c). Accordingly, the Board grants the Veteran AOD status herein based on his homeless.

Service Connection

Legal Criteria

Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service. See 38 U.S.C. § 1131; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303.  A veteran seeking compensation under these provisions must establish three elements: (1) the existence of a present disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship ("nexus") between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service. Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (citing Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004)).

VA is responsible for determining whether the evidence persuasively favors one side or another. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. When there is an approximate or nearly equal balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an issue material to the determination of the matter, the benefit of the doubt in resolving each such issue shall be given to the Veteran and the claim will be granted on the merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b). When the evidence persuasively favors against the claim of the Veteran, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable and the claim will be denied on its merits. 38 U.S.C. § 5107; Lynch v. McDonough, 21 F.4th 776, 781 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (en banc).

1. Service connection for a left knee condition.

Analysis

The Veteran contends that his left knee condition is related to service.

Service treatment records (STRs) provide that the Veteran was seen for a knee condition; however, it was noted in February 2016 that his left knee was "normal." There is no further evaluation or treatment for the left knee.

Here, the evidence does not establish a current disability. The existence of a current disability is the cornerstone of a claim for VA disability compensation. Degmetich v. Brown, 104 F.3d 1328 (1997). The evidence must show that the Veteran currently has the disability for which benefits are being claimed. Given that the Veteran does not have a separate diagnosis for a left knee condition, the remaining elements of service connection will not be addressed. 

Accordingly, the evidence persuasively weighs against the claim. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit of the doubt rule is not applicable, and service connection for a left knee condition must be denied. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781.

2. Service connection for a right knee condition.

Analysis

The Veteran contends that he injured his right knee while running with his unit during service.

Turning to the relevant evidence of record, the Veteran's service treatment records (STRs) indicate that in February 2016, the Veteran was running with his unit when he felt a pop in his right knee. In November 2017, the Veteran was seen for patellar tendonitis due to a knee injury. During a January 2018 exam, the Veteran noted that his knee gave out in Korea and that he treated it with Ibuprofen and a knee brace.

The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in October 2023 regarding his knee condition.  However, an October 2023 Exam Scheduling Request Contention Cancellation indicated the Veteran's examination was cancelled due to a "no show." The record indicates there was no response from the Veteran. Further, the record also includes an October 2023 Veteran Contact History document indicating courier service was delivered to the Veteran's address of record on October 16, 2023. Additionally, notifications were sent to the Veteran via text message and telephone call. 

During the appeal period, there was no indication in the record that the October 2023 rating decision was returned. Significantly, during the appeal period, the Veteran did not provide a reason for his failure to attend the examination or request the examination be rescheduled.  Accordingly, the Board finds the Veteran failed to report to his scheduled VA examination regarding his right knee condition without good cause. The Board therefore finds the VA's duty to assist has been met and will decide the Veteran's claim based upon the remaining evidence of record.

Here, without the benefit of a VA examination and opinion, the evidence of record is insufficient to grant to claim sought on appeal. The record is devoid of any evidence suggesting that the Veteran has a current right knee condition that is related to military service. There is no evidence of record that the Veteran has a current right knee disability beyond the Veteran's lay statements that he has right knee issues. Even if the Board were to assume that the Veteran's reported symptomatology may otherwise constitute a disability for VA purposes, there is no evidence of record, to include a competent medical opinion, associating the condition to the Veteran's in-service report of right knee pain. See Saunders v. Wilkie, 886 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

Accordingly, the evidence of record at this time weighs persuasively against a finding that the Veteran has a right knee condition that began in service, within a year of service, or is etiologically related to his military service. As there is not an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not applicable and service connection for a right knee condition is not warranted. See 38 U.S.C. § 5107 (b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102; Lynch, 21 F.4th at 781.
