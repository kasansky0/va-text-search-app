REMANDED

Service connection for headaches including cervicogenic headaches and/or migraines is remanded.

REASONS FOR REMAND

The Veteran served on active duty from June 1980 to October 1980.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in September 2023 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies. See 38 C.F.R. § 3.2400(a)(1).  

In December 2023, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 20-0995, Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim, and requested readjudication of service connection for headaches most recently addressed in a September 2023 rating decision. In February 2024, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) issued the supplemental claim decision on appeal, which found that new and relevant evidence had been received and denied the claim based on the evidence of record at the time of that decision. 

In the February 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket. On the VA Form 10182, the Veteran indicated he was appealing 'headaches to include migraine' but noted only the September 2023 rating decision. Although the Veteran's Form 10182 did not explicitly list the February 2024 supplemental claim decision, the Veteran did identify an intent to appeal headaches. Construing the VA Form 10182 liberally, the Board accepts that the February 2024 VA Form 10182 appealed the February 2024 supplemental claim decision as to the denial of service connection for headaches. See 38 C.F.R. § 20.202(a) (the Board will construe such arguments in a liberal manner for purposes of determining whether they raise issues on appeal). Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the February 2024 AOJ decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301.

Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. However, because the Board is remanding the claim of service connection for headaches, any evidence the Board could not consider will be considered by the AOJ in the adjudication of those claims. 38 C.F.R. § 3.103(c)(2)(ii). 

The Veteran submitted the claim on appeal using a signed VA Form 21-526EZ, Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits. The complete VA Form 21-526EZ includes 'Notice to Veteran/Service Member of Evidence Necessary to Substantiate a Claim for Veterans Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits.' This part of the form contains explicit notice to the claimant that "You are entitled to a hearing at any time in the claims process. If you wish to have a hearing or have other questions, contact VA online through Ask VA: https://ask.va.gov or call us toll-free at 1-800-827-1000 (TTY:711)." By signing the VA Form 21-526EZ, the Veteran certified they received the notice attached to their application titled, Notice to Veteran/Service Member of Evidence Necessary to Substantiate a Claim for Veterans Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits. Therefore, the Board finds that he was provided with notice of his right to a hearing before the AOJ issued its initial decision on appeal.

1. Service connection for headaches including cervicogenic headaches and/or migraines is remanded.

The issue of entitlement to service connection for headaches is remanded to correct duty to assist errors that occurred prior to the February 2024 rating decision on appeal. 

First, the AOJ obtained May 2023, June 2023, August 2023, and February 2024 VA examinations and opinions; however, these medical opinions do not provide an adequate rationale regarding whether the Veteran's headaches are caused or aggravated by his service connected disabilities or are otherwise related to service.

The May 2023 VA examiner diagnosed intermittent cervicogenic headaches, but opined that the Veteran's headaches are less likely than not the result of his service connected tinnitus. In contrast, the February 2023 VA examiner indicated that the Veteran's symptoms are not consistent with headache pain; therefore, the examiner found the Veteran did not have a diagnosis. Although an August 2023 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's headaches were less likely than not the result of his tinnitus and/or were less likely than not caused by his toxic exposure risk activities, an August 2023 clarifying addendum opinion reiterated that no diagnosis was made regarding headaches such that no opinion was rendered. Yet, a February 2024 VA headaches examination indicates the Veteran has a diagnosis of migraine including migraine variants. The February 2024 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's headache disability was less likely than not incurred in or caused by service.  

In providing negative secondary service connection opinions, the VA examiners did not address aggravation. 38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (b); Spicer v. McDonough, 61 F.4th 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2023); El-Amin v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 136, 140 (2013). Additionally, in reference to the Veteran's non-service connected obstructive sleep apnea, the August 2023 VA examiner indicated that disrupted breathing and oxygen desaturation can trigger migraines. The VA opinions of record do not address whether the Veteran's service connected asthma also results in disrupted breathing and oxygen desaturation such that his headaches are caused or aggravated by his service connected asthma. The Board also finds the February 2024 direct service connection opinion inadequate as it appears to be based solely on the lack of in-service and post-service medical records corroborating or documenting headache pain. See generally Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007); see also Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F. 3d 1331, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Accordingly, on remand, addendum opinions must be obtained. 

Finally, prior to the February 2024 rating decision on appeal, the Veteran identified relevant outstanding private treatment records from J.D.G., M.D. A remand is required to allow VA to obtain these records.

In remanding this case, the Board makes no credibility determination, expressed or implied.

The matters are REMANDED for the following action:

1. If appropriate, ask the Veteran to complete a VA Form 21-4142 for J.D.G., M.D. Make two requests for the authorized records from J.D.G., M.D, unless it is clear after the first request that a second request would be futile.

2. Obtain an addendum opinion from an appropriate clinician addressing the following:

(a.) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's headaches are related to his active service, to include as a result of his exposure to as fuels, industrial solvents, paints and other chemicals ?

(b.) Is it at least as likely as not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher) that the Veteran's headaches were caused by his service-connected tinnitus and/or asthma? 

(c.) Is it at least as likely as not(likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if not higher)  that the Veteran's headaches were aggravated by his service-connected tinnitus and/or asthma?

The examiner must provide a complete rationale for all proffered opinions. In doing so, the examiner should consider the Veteran's lay report regarding the onset and recurrence of his symptoms.
