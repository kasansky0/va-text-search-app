ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for urothelial carcinoma (bladder tumor) is granted.

Entitlement to a compensable disability rating for hypertension is denied.

FINDINGS OF FACT

1. The Veteran has a current diagnosis of bladder cancer and has conceded service in the Republic of Vietnam.

2. Effective January 1, 2021, bladder cancer was added to the list of presumptive diseases associated with herbicide exposure.

3. During the appeal period, the Veteran's hypertension did not manifest in diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more. He did not both have a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more and require continuous medication for control.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW

1. The criteria for entitlement to service connection for bladder cancer have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1101, 1110, 1112, 1113, 1116; 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.102, 3.303, 3.307, 3.309.

2. The criteria for a compensable disability rating for hypertension have not been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1155, 5107; 38 C.F.R. §§ 4.1-4.7, 4.21, 4.31, 4.104, Diagnostic Code 7101.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty from August 1968 to May 1972.

The rating decision on appeal was issued in March 2024 and constitutes an initial decision; therefore, the modernized review system, also known as the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), applies.

In the April 2024 VA Form 10182, Decision Review Request: Board Appeal (Notice of Disagreement), the Veteran elected the Direct Review docket.

Therefore, the Board may only consider the evidence of record at the time of the March 2024 agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) decision on appeal. 38 C.F.R. § 20.301. Any evidence submitted after the AOJ decision on appeal cannot be considered by the Board. 38 C.F.R. §§ 20.300, 20.301, 20.801. 

If the Veteran would like VA to consider any evidence that was submitted that the Board could not consider, the Veteran may file a Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995) and submit or identify this evidence. 38 C.F.R. § 3.2501. If the evidence is new and relevant, VA will issue another decision on the claims, considering the new evidence in addition to the evidence previously considered. Id. Specific instructions for filing a Supplemental Claim are included with this decision.

The Board is cognizant of the ruling of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court) in Rice v. Shinseki, 22 Vet. App. 447 (2009). In Rice, the Court held that a claim for a total rating based on individual unemployability (TDIU) due to service-connected disability, either expressly raised by the Veteran or reasonably raised by the record, involves an attempt to obtain an appropriate rating for a disability and is part of the claim for an increased rating. In this case, the Veteran has not argued, and the record does not otherwise reflect, that the disability at issue renders him unemployable. Accordingly, the Board concludes that a claim for TDIU has not been raised.

Service Connection

Establishing service connection generally requires (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) evidence of a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability. Shedden v. Principi, 381 F.3d 1163, 1167 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

Service connection may also be established on a presumptive basis; certain diseases associated with exposure to herbicide agents used in support of military operations in Vietnam during the Vietnam era will be considered to have been incurred in service 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6). The presumption requires exposure to an herbicide agent and manifestation of the claimed disease to a degree of 10 percent or more within the time period specified for each disease. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(ii). Diseases found associated with herbicide agent exposure for purposes of the presumption are specified in the statute and regulation and include bladder cancer. 38 U.S.C. § 1116(a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e). Bladder cancer may be presumptively service connected if it manifests at any time after service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(a)(6)(ii).

Urothelial carcinoma (bladder tumor)

The Veteran asserts that service connection for his bladder cancer is warranted on a presumptive basis. For the reasons set forth below, service connection for bladder cancer is warranted.

If a veteran was exposed to an herbicide agent during active military, naval, or air service, certain diseases shall be service connected even though there is no record of such disease during service. 38 C.F.R. § 3.309 (e). U.S.C. § 1116(a)(2) was recently amended to include bladder cancer on the list of diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents.

Private treatment records identify a current diagnosis of bladder cancer. See November 2021 Advanced Urology Institute pathology report. 

The March 2024 rating decision conceded service in the Republic of Vietnam and exposure to herbicides during miliary service. Under the AMA, favorable findings made by the RO are binding on the Board. The Veteran's exposure to herbicide agents is, thus, presumed. 38 C.F.R. § 3.307(e)(6)(iii).

Bladder cancer is a disease subject to presumptive service connection. The Veteran has a current diagnosis of bladder cancer and exposure to herbicide agents is presumed. Therefore, service connection for bladder cancer is warranted on a presumptive basis and, therefore, the claim is granted. 38 U.S.C. § 1116 (a)(2); 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(e).

Increased Rating

Disability ratings are determined by the application of VA's Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Schedule), which is based on the average impairment of earning capacity. Separate diagnostic codes identify the various disabilities. 38 U.S.C. § 1155; 38 C.F.R. Part 4. Pertinent regulations do not require that all cases show all findings specified by the Schedule, but that findings sufficient to identify the disease and the resulting disability and, above all, coordination of the rating with impairment of function will be expected in all cases. 38 C.F.R. § 4.21; see also Mauerhan v. Principi, 16 Vet. App. 436 (2002).

When after careful consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt arises regarding the degree of disability such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. 38 C.F.R. § 4.3. Where there is a question as to which of two ratings shall be applied, the higher rating will be assigned if the disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating. Otherwise, the lower rating will be assigned. 38 C.F.R. § 4.7.

Hypertension

The Veteran is seeking an initial compensable disability rating for hypertension. 

Hypertension is rated pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 4.104, DC 7101, for hypertensive vascular disease (hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension). Under DC 7101, a 10 percent rating is warranted for diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, or systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or it is the minimum evaluation for an individual with a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.

A zero percent evaluation shall be assigned when the requirements for a compensable evaluation are not met. 38 C.F.R. § 4.31. As pertinent to a 10 percent rating for hypertension, the term "predominant" is not defined in the rating criteria. Merriam-Webster defines predominant to mean "being most frequent or common." See, e.g., "predominant," Merriam-Webster.com Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/predominant.

The issue in this appeal becomes whether the Veteran's hypertension manifested in diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more, systolic pressure predominantly 160 or more, or a history of diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more and requires continuous medication for control.

For the reasons that follow, the Veteran's hypertension has not more nearly approximated the criteria corresponding to a 10 percent disability rating.

The Veteran was afforded a January 2024 VA examination to determine the severity of hypertension. The Veteran reported the use of medication to control his hypertension. The VA examiner found that the Veteran did not present with a history of diastolic blood pressure elevation of predominantly 100 or more. The VA noted that Veteran blood pressure measured at 141/84, 144/80, and 128/79 during the examination.

Review of the Veteran's treatment records reveal that the Veteran's blood pressure is stable and controlled by medication.

The evidence does not show where the Veteran has had any systolic pressures of 160 or greater. While the evidence clearly shows that the Veteran required continuous medication to control his blood pressure, it does not show where the medication was necessary to control diastolic pressures predominantly 100 or more.

The Board finds the examination to be adequate for rating purposes. The examination was based on in-person examinations and contain sufficient detail (specifically the blood pressure readings summarized previously) for the Board to properly rate the Veteran under the applicable Diagnostic Code.

All of the relevant medical evidence of record has been reviewed, including treatment records that contain blood pressure readings. In sum, during the period on review, there is not a showing of predominant readings of diastolic pressure at 100 or above or systolic pressure above 160, or diastolic pressure predominantly 100 or more who requires continuous medication for control.

The Board therefore finds that the criteria for entitlement to a compensable disability rating for hypertension have not been met.

To the extent that the Veteran seeks a compensable rating for his service-connected hypertension, the weight of the persuasive evidence is against the appeal, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine is not for application, and the appeal must be denied. 38 U.S.C. § 5107(b); see also Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 57 (1990).
