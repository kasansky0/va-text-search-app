REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

The Veteran served on active duty in the United States Army from October 1987 to August 1996.

This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from rating decisions issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) under the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA).

The Veteran's claims of service connection were denied in a July 2023 rating decision.  In July 2023, the Veteran filed a VA Form 20-0996, Decision Review Request: Higher Level Review (HLR), disagreeing with the rating decision. Subsequently, in a November 2023 HLR rating decision, the Veteran's claims were again denied.

In February 2024, the Veteran submitted a VA Form 10182, requesting direct Board review of the evidence by the Veterans Law Judge.  Accordingly, based on his selections of the HLR lane and the Direct Review option, the Board is limited to review of the evidence in the record up and until the date of notification of the July 2023 rating decision.  See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.2601, 20.301.  Additional evidence has been added to the claims file since the rating decision on appeal was issued.  The Board, by operation of law cannot review that evidence in adjudicating this appeal.  To the extent the Veteran would like that evidence reviewed in conjunction with any of the issues on appeal, he may file a supplemental claim and identify or resubmit the evidence.  Instructions on filing a supplemental claim are attached to this decision.

The Veteran is seeking service connection for left upper extremity radiculopathy with numbness, ED, urinary frequency, and a shoulder scar as a result of his military service.

Service treatment records are absent of any complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of these disabilities.

Despite the Veteran's contentions, a thorough review of the claims file, reveals that the Veteran has not been clinically diagnosed with left upper extremity radiculopathy with numbness, ED, urinary frequency, or a shoulder scar.  For example, obtain or maintain substantially gainful employment a December 2021 VA treatment record, the Veteran denied any numbness.

In the absence of proof of present disability there can be no successful claim.  Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).  The Court has held that the requirement for service connection that a current disability be present is satisfied when a claimant has a disability at the time a claim for VA disability compensation is filed or during the pendency of that claim even though the disability resolves prior to the Secretary's adjudication of the claim.  See McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319, 321 (2007).

The Veteran was afforded a VA Scar/Disfigurement examination in August 2019.  While an appendectomy residual scar was found, a shoulder scar was not.  The Veteran was also afforded a VA Shoulder and Arm Condition examination where no scar was found by the physical examination.  

The Board also acknowledges that the Veteran has not been provided with a VA examination for the remaining claimed disabilities.  However, as the service and post-service treatment records are silent for an injury, treatment, or diagnosis of these disabilities, one is not warranted, as a conclusory generalized lay statement that service event or illness caused the claimant's current condition is insufficient to require the Secretary to provide an examination. See Waters v. Shinseki, 601 F.3d 1274, 1278 (2010).

The only evidence of record in support of these claims consists of his own limited statements, which fail to explain in any detail the incident or onset of these claimed disabilities.  He is considered competent to report the observable manifestations of his claimed disabilities, but he needs to provide more information before VA's duty to assist is triggered.  See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465, 4 69-70 (1994).  Although lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues, see Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428, 435 (2011), he is not medically trained to diagnose these disabilities, as such falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person.  See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  Here, the evidence does not support a finding that the Veteran had an in-service, or current diagnoses, of left upper extremity radiculopathy with numbness, ED, urinary frequency, or a shoulder scar.

As such, the criteria for service connection have not been met for left upper extremity radiculopathy with numbness, ED, urinary frequency, and a shoulder scar and the Veteran's claims are denied.
